 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p7"></a>Of voluntary and involuntary homicides St. Basil treats at length in his <i>Canonical Epistle ad Amphilochium</i>, can. viii., lvi. and lvii., and fixes the time of penance at twenty years for voluntary and ten years for involuntary homicides.  It is evident that the penance given for this crime varied in different churches, although it is clear from the great length of the penance, how enormous the crime was considered, no light or short penance being sufficient.</p>
