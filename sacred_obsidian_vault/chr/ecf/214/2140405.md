 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xxii-p2.1"></a>Those</span> who have become guilty of crimes against the canons, and on this account subject to complete and perpetual deposition, are degraded to the condition of layman.  If, however, keeping conversion continually before their eyes, they willingly deplore the sin on account of which they fell from grace, and made themselves aliens therefrom, they may still cut their hair after the manner of clerics.  But if they are not willing to submit themselves to this canon, they must wear their hair as laymen, as being those who have preferred the communion of the world to the celestial life.</p>
