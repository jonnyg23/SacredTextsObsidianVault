 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.vii-p7"></a>Heretics are not to be permitted to enter the house of God, and yet Basil the Great, before this canon was set forth, admitted Valens to the perfecting of the faithful [i.e., to the witnessing the celebration of the Divine Mysteries].</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.vii-p9"></a>A heretic who pertinaciously rejects the doctrine of the Church is rightly not allowed to enter the house of God, in which his doctrine is set forth, so long as he continues in his heresy.  For this reason when Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria, was consulted concerning the admission of heretics to church, answered in the <span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.vii-p9.1"></a>IX</span>th Canon of his <i>Canonical Epistle</i>, that unless they were ready to promise to do penance and to abandon their heresy, they could in no way be admitted to the prayers of the faithful.</p>
