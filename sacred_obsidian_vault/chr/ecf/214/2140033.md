 <p class="c35"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p5"></a>Whoso had lapsed are to be deposed whether those who ordained and promoted them did so conscious of their guilt or unknowing of it.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7"></a>The tenth canon differs from the ninth, inasmuch as it concerns only the <i>lapsi</i> and their elevation, not only to the priesthood, but to any other ecclesiastical preferment as well, and requires their deposition.  The punishment of a bishop who should consciously perform such an ordination is not mentioned; but it is incontestable that the <i>lapsi</i> could not be ordained, even after having performed penance; for, as the preceding canon states, the Church requires those who were faultless.  It is to be observed that the word <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.1"></a>προχειρίζειν</span> is evidently employed here in the sense of “ordain,” and is used without any distinction from <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.2"></a>χειρίζειν</span>, whilst in the synodal letter of the Council of Nicæa on the subject of the Meletians, there is a distinction between these two words, and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.3"></a>προχειρίζειν</span> is used to signify <i>eligere</i>.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p8"></a>This canon is found in <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>.  <i>Decretum</i>.  Pars I.  Dist. lxxxi.  c.v.</p>
