 <p class="c31"><a name="xvi.ix-p3"></a>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. VII., col. 389.)</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xvi.ix-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.ix-p4.1"></a>Leo</span> the most renowned secretary said:  The holy and blessed Synod know how at the last session we examined divers sayings of the God-forsaken heretics, who had brought charges against the holy and spotless Church of the Christians for the setting up of the holy images.  But to-day we have in our hands the written blasphemy of those calumniators of the Christians, that is to say, the absurd, and easily answered, and self-convicting definition (<span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.ix-p4.2"></a>ὅρον</span>) of the pseudosyllogus, in all respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the God-hated heretics.  But not only have we this, but also the artful and most drastic refutation thereof, which the Holy Spirit had supervised.  For it was right that this definition should be made a triumph by wise contradictions, and should be torn to pieces with strong refutations.  This also we submit so as to know your pleasure with regard to it.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xvi.ix-p5"></a>The holy Synod said:  Let it be read.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xvi.ix-p6"></a>John, the deacon and chancellor [of the most holy great Church of Constantinople, <i>in Lat. only</i>] read.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xvi.ix-p7"></a>[<i>John, the deacon, then read the orthodox refutation, and Gregory, the bishop of Neocæsarea, the Definition of the Mock Council, the one reading the heretical statement and the other the orthodox answer</i>.]</p>
