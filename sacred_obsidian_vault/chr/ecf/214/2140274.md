 <p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6"></a>If any one maintains that the flesh which is united with God the Word is by the power of its own nature life-giving, whereas the Lord himself says, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061">John 6.61</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.1"></a>), let him be anathema.  [He adds, “God is a Spirit” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024">John 4.24</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.2"></a>).  If, then, any one maintains that God the Logos has in a carnal manner, in his substance, become flesh, and persists in this with reference to the Lord Christ; who himself after his resurrection said to his disciples, “Handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039">Luke 24.39</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.3"></a>); let him be anathema.]</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p11"></a>We perform in the churches the holy, lifegiving, and unbloody sacrifice; the body, as also the precious blood, which is exhibited we believe not to be that of a common man and of any one like unto us, but receiving it rather as his own body and as the blood of the Word which gives all things life.  For common flesh cannot give life.  And this our Saviour himself testified when he said:  “The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that giveth life.”  For since the flesh became the very own of the Word, therefore we understand that it is lifegiving, as the Saviour himself said:  “As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me shall live by me.”  Since therefore Nestorius and those who think with him rashly dissolve the power of this mystery; therefore it was convenient that this anathematism should be put forth.</p>
