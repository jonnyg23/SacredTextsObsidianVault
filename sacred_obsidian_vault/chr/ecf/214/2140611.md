 <p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p2"></a>Concerning Quodvultdeus, the bishop.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p3.1"></a>In</span> the case of Quodvultdeus of Centuria, it pleased all the bishops that no one should communicate with him until his cause should be brought to a conclusion, for his accuser when he sought to bring the cause before our council, upon being asked whether he was willing with him to be tried before the bishops, at first said that he was, but on another day answered that he was not willing, and went away.  Under these circumstances to deprive him of his bishoprick, before the conclusion of his cause was known, could commend itself to no Christian as a just act.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p6"></a>Since Quodvultdeus at first promised to come to our synod when his opposer had asked that he be admitted, and afterwards withdrew, saying that that was displeasing to him, he should be excommunicated, until the cause is finished.  But it is not just that he be deposed before sentence is given.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p7"></a>This canon is part of Canon ij. of Synod of Milevis, <span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p7.1"></a>a.d.</span> 402.</p>
