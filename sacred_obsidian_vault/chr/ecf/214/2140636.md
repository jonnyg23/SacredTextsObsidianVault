 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p2"></a>That the grace of Christ gives not only the knowledge of our duty, but also inspires us with a desire that we may be able to accomplish what we know.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p3.1"></a>Also</span>, whoever shall say that the same grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord helps us only in not sinning by revealing to us and opening to our understanding the commandments, so that we may know what to seek, what we ought to avoid, and also that we should love to do so, but that through it we are not helped so that we are able to do what we know we should do, let him be anathema.  For when the Apostle says:  “Wisdom puffeth up, but charity edifieth” it were truly infamous were we to believe <a name="page_498"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 498</font></a> <a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-Page_498"></a>that we have the grace of Christ for that which puffeth us up, but have it not for that which edifieth, since in each case it is the gift of God, both to know what we ought to do, and to love to do it; so that wisdom cannot puff us up while charity is edifying us.  For as of God it is written, “Who teacheth man knowledge,” so also it is written, “Love is of God.”</p>
