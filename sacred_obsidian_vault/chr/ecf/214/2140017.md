 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.v-p2"></a>(J. B. Lightfoot.  <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i>—Part II. Vol. ii. Sec. I. pp. 90, <i>et seqq.</i>)</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.v-p3"></a>The Son is here [Ignat. <i>Ad. Eph.</i> vii.] declared to be <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.1"></a>γεννητὸς</span> as man and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.2"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> as God, for this is clearly shown to be the meaning from the parallel clauses.  Such language is not in accordance with later theological definitions, which carefully distinguished between <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.3"></a>γενητός</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.4"></a>γεννητός</span> between <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.5"></a>ἀγένητος</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.6"></a>ἀγέννητος</span>; so that <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.7"></a>γενητός, ἀγένητος</span> respectively denied and affirmed the eternal existence, being equivalent to <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.8"></a>κτιστός</span>, <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.9"></a>ἄκτιστος</span>, while <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.10"></a>γεννητός</span>, <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.11"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> described certain ontological relations, whether in time or in eternity.  In the later theological language, therefore, the Son was <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.12"></a>γεννητός</span> even in his Godhead.  See esp. Joann. Damasc. <i>de Fid. Orth.</i> i. 8 [where he draws the conclusion that only the Father is <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.13"></a>ἀγέννητος</span>, and only the Son <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p3.14"></a>γεννητός</span>].</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vii.v-p4"></a>There can be little doubt however, that Ignatius wrote <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.1"></a>γεννητός καὶ ἀγέννητος</span>, though his editors frequently alter it into <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.2"></a>γενητὸς καὶ ἀγένητος</span>.  For (1) the Greek <span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p4.3"></a>ms.</span> still retains the double [Greek nun] <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.4"></a>ν</span>, though the claims of orthodoxy would be a temptation to scribes to <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a> <a name="vii.v-Page_5"></a>substitute the single <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.5"></a>ν</span>.  And to this reading also the Latin <i>genitus et ingenitus</i> points.  On the other hand it cannot be concluded that translators who give <i>factus et non factus</i> had the words with one <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.6"></a>ν</span>, for this was after all what Ignatius meant by the double <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.7"></a>ν</span>, and they would naturally render his words so as to make his orthodoxy apparent.  (2) When Theodoret writes <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.8"></a>γεννητὸς ἐξ ἀγεννήτου</span>, it is clear that he, or the person before him who first substituted this reading, must have read <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.9"></a>γεννητὸς καὶ ἀγέννητος</span>, for there would be no temptation to alter the perfectly orthodox <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.10"></a>γενητὸς καὶ ἀγένητος</span>, nor (if altered) would it have taken this form.  (3) When the interpolator substitutes <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.11"></a>ὁ μόνος ἄληθινὸς Θεὸς ὁ ἀγέννητος</span>…<span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.12"></a>τοῦ δὲ       μονογονοῦς       πατῂρ καὶ       γεννήτωρ</span>, the       natural inference is that he too, had the forms in double       <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.13"></a>ν</span>, which he retained,       at the same time altering the whole run of the sentence so as not       to do violence to his own doctrinal views; see Bull <i>Def. Fid.       Nic.</i> ii. 2 § 6.  (4) The quotation in Athanasius is       more difficult.  The <span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p4.14"></a>mss.</span> vary, and       his editors write <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.15"></a>γενητὸς       καὶ       ἀγένητος</span>.        Zahn too, who has paid more attention to this point than any       previous editor of Ignatius, in his former work (<i>Ign. v.       Ant.</i> p. 564), supposed Athanasius to have read and written       the words with a single <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.16"></a>ν</span>, though in his subsequent edition of       Ignatius (p. 338) he declares himself unable to determine between       the single and double <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.17"></a>ν</span>.  I believe, however, that the       argument of Athanasius decides in favour of the <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.18"></a>νν</span>.  Elsewhere he insists       repeatedly on the distinction between <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.19"></a>κτίζειν</span> and       <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.20"></a>γεννᾶν</span>, justifying       the use of the latter term as applied to the divinity of the Son,       and defending the statement in the Nicene Creed <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.21"></a>γεννητὸν       ἐκ τῆς       οὐσίας τοῦ       πατρὸς τὸν       υἱὸν       ὁμοούσιον</span>       (<i>De Synod.</i> 54, 1, p. 612).  Although he is not       responsible for the language of the Macrostich (<i>De Synod.</i>       3, 1, p. 590), and would have regarded it as inadequate without       the <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.22"></a>ὁμοούσιον,</span>       yet this use of terms entirely harmonizes with his own.  In       the passage before us, <i>ib.</i> §§ 46, 47 (p. 607),       he is defending the use of <i>homousios</i> at Nicæa,       notwithstanding that it had been previously rejected by the       council which condemned Paul of Samosata, and he contends that       both councils were orthodox, since they used <i>homousios</i> in       a different sense.  As a parallel instance he takes the word       <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.23"></a>ἀγέννητος</span>       which like <i>homousios</i> is not a scriptural word, and like it       also is used in two ways, signifying either (1) <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.24"></a>Τὸ ὂν μεν,       μήτε δὲ       γεννηθὲν       μήτε ὅλως       ἔχον τὸν       αἴτιον,</span> or (2) <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.25"></a>Τὸ       ἄκτιστον</span>.        In the former sense the Son cannot be called <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.26"></a>ἀγέννητος</span>,       in the latter he may be so called.  Both uses, he says, are       found in the fathers.  Of the latter he quotes the passage       in Ignatius as an example; of the former he says, that some       writers subsequent to Ignatius declare <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.27"></a>ἕν τὸ       ἀγέννητον ὁ       πατὴρ, καὶ       εἶς ὁ ἐξ       αὐτου υἱὸς       γνήσιος,       γέννημα       αληθίνον       κ.τ.λ</span>.  [He may have been thinking of       Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> vi. 7, which I shall quote       below.]  He maintains that both are orthodox, as having in       view two different senses of the word <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.28"></a>ἀγέννητον</span>       , and the same, he argues, is the case with the councils which       seem to take opposite sides with regard to       <i>homousios</i>.  It is clear from this passage, as Zahn       truly says, that Athanasius is dealing with one and the same word       throughout; and, if so, it follows that this word must be       <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.29"></a>ἀγέννητον</span>,       since <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.30"></a>ἀγένητον</span>       would be intolerable in some places.  I may add by way of       caution that in two other passages, <i>de Decret. Syn. Nic.</i>       28 (1, p. 184), <i>Orat. c. Arian.</i> i. 30 (1, p. 343), St.       Athanasius gives the various senses of <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.31"></a>ἀγένητον</span>       (for this is plain from the context), and that these passages       ought not to be treated as parallels to the present passage which       is concerned with the senses of <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.32"></a>ἀγέννητον</span>       .  Much confusion is thus created, <i>e.g.</i> in       Newmans notes on the several passages in the Oxford       translation of Athanasius (pp. 51 sq., 224 sq.), where the three       passages are treated as parallel, and no attempt is made to       discriminate the readings in the several places, but       “ingenerate” is given as the rendering of both       alike.  If then Athanasius who read <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.33"></a>γεννητὸς       καὶ       ἀγέννητος</span>       in Ignatius, there is absolutely no authority for the spelling       with one <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.34"></a>ν</span>.  The       earlier editors (Voss, Ussher, Cotelier, etc.), printed it as       they found it in the <span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p4.35"></a>ms.</span>; but Smith       substituted the forms with the single <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.36"></a>ν</span>, and he has been followed more recently by       Hefele, Dressel, and some other.  In the Casanatensian copy       of the <span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p4.37"></a>ms.</span>, a marginal note is added,       <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.38"></a>ἀναγνωστέον</span>       <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a> <a name="vii.v-Page_6"></a><span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.39"></a>ἀγένητος       τοῦτ᾽ ἔστι       μὴ       ποιηθείς</span>.        Waterland (<i>Works,</i> III., p. 240 sq., Oxf. 1823) tries       ineffectually to show that the form with the double <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.40"></a>ν</span> was invented by the fathers at a       later date to express their theological conception.  He even       “doubts whether there was any such word as <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p4.41"></a>ἀγέννητος</span>       so early as the time of Ignatius.”  In this he is       certainly wrong.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vii.v-p5"></a>The <span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p5.1"></a>mss.</span> of early Christian writers exhibit much confusion between these words spelled with the double and the single <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.2"></a>ν</span>.  See <i>e.g.</i> Justin <i>Dial.</i> 2, with Ottos note; Athenag. <i>Suppl</i>. 4 with Ottos note; Theophil, <i>ad Autol.</i> ii. 3, 4; Iren. iv. 38, 1, 3; Orig. <i>c. Cels.</i> vi. 66; Method. <i>de Lib. Arbitr.</i>, p. 57; Jahn (see Jahns note 11, p. 122); Maximus in Euseb. <i>Præp. Ev.</i> vii. 22; Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> v. 16 (from Sibylline Oracles); Clem. Alex. <i>Strom</i>. v. 14; and very frequently in later writers.  Yet notwithstanding the confusion into which later transcribers have thus thrown the subject, it is still possible to ascertain the main facts respecting the usage of the two forms.  The distinction between the two terms, as indicated by their origin, is that <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.3"></a>ἀγένητος</span> denies <i>the creation</i>, and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.4"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> <i>the generation or parentage</i>.  Both are used at a very early date; <i>e.g.</i> <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.5"></a>ἀγένητος</span> by Parmenides in Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> v. 14, and by Agothon in Arist. <i>Eth. Nic.</i> vii. 2 (comp. also <i>Orac. Sibyll.</i> prooem. 7, 17); and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.6"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> in Soph. <i>Trach.</i> 61 (where it is equivalent to <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.7"></a>δυσγενῶν</span>.  Here the distinction of meaning is strictly preserved, and so probably it always is in Classical writers; for in Soph. <i>Trach.</i> 743 we should after Porson and Hermann read <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.8"></a>ἀγένητον</span> with Suidas.  In Christian writers also there is no reason to suppose that the distinction was ever lost, though in certain connexions the words might be used convertibly.  Whenever, as here in Ignatius, we have the double <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.9"></a>ν</span> where we should expect the single, we must ascribe the fact to the indistinctness or incorrectness of the writers theological conceptions, not to any obliteration of the meaning of the terms themselves.  To this early father for instance the eternal <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p5.10"></a>γέννησις</span> of the Son was not a distinct theological idea, though substantially he held the same views as the Nicene fathers respecting the Person of Christ.  The following passages from early Christian writers will serve at once to show how far the distinction was appreciated, and to what extent the Nicene conception prevailed in ante-Nicene Christianity; Justin <i>Apol</i>. ii. 6, comp. <i>ib.</i> § 13; Athenag. <i>Suppl</i>. 10 (comp. <i>ib.</i> 4); Theoph. <i>ad. Aut.</i> ii. 3; Tatian <i>Orat.</i> 5; Rhodon in Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> v. 13; Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> vi. 7; Orig. <i>c. Cels.</i> vi. 17, <i>ib.</i> vi. 52; Concil. Antioch (<span class="sc"><a name="vii.v-p5.11"></a>a.d.</span> 269) in Routh <i>Rel. Sacr.</i> III., p. 290; Method. <i>de Creat.</i> 5.  In no early Christian writing, however, is the distinction more obvious than in the <i>Clementine Homilies</i>, x. 10 (where the distinction is employed to support the writers heretical theology):  see also viii. 16, and comp. xix. 3, 4, 9, 12.  The following are instructive passages as regards the use of these words where the opinions of other heretical writers are given; Saturninus, Iren. i. 24, 1; Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> vii. 28; Simon Magus, Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> vi. 17, 18; the Valentinians, Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> vi. 29, 30; the Ptolemæus in particular, Ptol. <i>Ep. ad. Flor.</i> 4 (in Stierens Irenæus, p. 935); Basilides, Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> vii. 22; Carpocrates, Hippol. <i>Hær.</i> vii. 32.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vii.v-p6"></a>From the above passages it will appear that Ante-Nicene writers were not indifferent to the distinction of meaning between the two words; and when once the orthodox Christology was formulated in the Nicene Creed in the words <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.1"></a>γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα</span>, it became henceforth impossible to overlook the difference.  The Son was thus declared to be <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.2"></a>γεννητός</span> but not <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.3"></a>γενητός</span>.  I am therefore unable to agree with Zahn (<i>Marcellus</i>, pp. 40, 104, 223, <i>Ign. von Ant.</i> p. 565), that at the time of the Arian controversy the disputants were not alive to the difference of meaning.  See for example Epiphanius, <i>Hær.</i> lxiv. 8.  But it had no especial interest for them.  While the orthodox party clung to the <i>homousios</i> as enshrining the doctrine for which they fought, they had no liking for the terms <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.4"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.5"></a>γεννητός</span> as applied to the Father and the Son respectively, though unable to deny their propriety, because they were affected by the Arians and applied in their own way.  To the orthodox mind the Arian formula <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.6"></a>οὐκ ἦν πρὶν γεννηθήναι</span> or some Semiarian formula hardly less dangerous, seemed <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a> <a name="vii.v-Page_7"></a>always to be lurking under the expression <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.7"></a>Θεὸς γεννητός</span> as applied to the Son.  Hence the language of Epiphanius <i>Hær.</i> lxxiii. 19:  “As you refuse to accept our <i>homousios</i> because though used by the fathers, it does not occur in the Scriptures, so will we decline on the same grounds to accept your <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.8"></a>ἀγέννητος</span> .”  Similarly Basil <i>c. Eunom.</i> i., iv., and especially <i>ib.</i> further on, in which last passage he argues at great length against the position of the heretics, <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.9"></a>εἰ ἀγέννητος, φασὶν, ὁ πατήρ, γεννητὸς δὲ ὁ υἱός, οὐ τῆς αὐτῆς οὐσίας</span>.  See also the arguments against the Anomœans in [Athan.] <i>Dial. de Trin</i>. ii. passim.  This fully explains the reluctance of the orthodox party to handle terms which their adversaries used to endanger the <i>homousios</i>.  But, when the stress of the Arian controversy was removed, it became convenient to express the Catholic doctrine by saying that the Son in his divine nature was <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.10"></a>γέννητος</span> but not <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.v-p6.11"></a>γένητος</span>.  And this distinction is staunchly maintained in later orthodox writers, <i>e.g.</i> John of Damascus, already quoted in the beginning of this Excursus.</p>
