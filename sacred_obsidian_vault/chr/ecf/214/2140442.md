 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lix-p7"></a>It is well known that in the first centuries it was customary that the Holy Eucharist should be taken back by the faithful to their houses; and that at home they received it at their own hands.  It is evident that this was what was done by the Anchorites and monks who lived in the deserts, as may be seen proved by Cardinal Bona.  (<i>De Rebus Liturg</i>., Lib. II., cap. xvij.).  From this domestic communion it is easily seen how the abuse arose which is condemned in this canon.</p>
