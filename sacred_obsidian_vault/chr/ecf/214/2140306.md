 <p class="c18"><a name="xi.vi-p4"></a>And when these letters [i.e. Cyrils letter to Nestorius <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.vi-p4.1"></a>Καταφλυαροῦσι</span> and his letter to John of Antioch <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.vi-p4.2"></a>Εὐφραινέσθωσαν]</span> had been read, the most reverend bishops cried out:  We all so believe:  Pope Leo thus believes:  anathema to him who divides and to him who confounds:  this is the faith of Archbishop Leo:  Leo thus believes:  Leo and Anatolius so believe:  we all thus believe.  As Cyril so believe we, all of us:  eternal be the memory of Cyril:  as the epistles of Cyril teach such is our mind, such has been our faith:  such is our faith:  this is the mind of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xi.vi-p5"></a>The most glorious judges and the great senate said:  Let there be read also the epistle of the most worthy Leo, Archbishop of Old Rome, the Imperial City.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xi.vi-p6"></a>Beronician, the most devout clerk of the sacred consistory, read from a book handed him by Aëtius, Archdeacon of the holy Church of Constantinople, the encyclical or synodical letter of the most holy Leo, the Archbishop, written to Flavian, Archbishop of Constantinople.</p>
