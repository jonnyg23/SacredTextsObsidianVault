 </p><p class="c34"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p1"></a> <span class="c4"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p1.1"></a>Canon XC.  (Greek xciii.)</span></p> 
 <p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p2"></a>Of those who have once read in church, that they cannot be advanced by others.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p3.1"></a>Item</span>, it seemed good that whoever in church even once had read should not be admitted to the ministry (<i>clericatum</i>) by another church.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p4"></a>And they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and, having read it, have signed it.  Likewise also the rest of the bishops signed.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p6"></a>He who has only once read in a Church [i.e., diocese] shall not be admitted into the clergy by another Church.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p7"></a>This is Canon iv. of Milevis, 402.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p8"></a><a name="page_486"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 486</font></a> <a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-Page_486"></a><i>There is set forth in this council what the bishops did who were sent as legates across seas.</i></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p9"></a>In the consulship of those most illustrious men, the most glorious Emperor Theodosius Augustus, and Rumoridus, the VIII. <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">468</font></a>
  Calends of September, at Carthage, in the basilica of the second region, when Aurelius the bishop had taken his seat in plenary council, the deacons standing by, Aurelius, the bishop, said:  From stress of circumstances, venerable brethren, I, although so small, have been led to assemble you in council.  For a while ago, as your holinesses will remember, while holding a council we sent our brothers as legates to the regions beyond seas.  It is right that these should at this meeting of your holinesses narrate the course of their now finished legation, and although yesterday when we were in session concerning this matter, besides ecclesiastical matters, we paid some prolonged attention to what they had done, nevertheless it is right that to-day the discussion of yesterday should be confirmed by ecclesiastical action.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p11"></a><i>Of the bishops of the African provinces who were not present at this council.</i> <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">469</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p13"></a>The right order of things demands that first of all we should enquire concerning our brethren and fellow bishops, who were to come to this council either from Byzacena or at least from Mauritania, like as they decreed that they would be present in this council.  And when Philologius, Geta, Venustianus, and Felician, bishops of the province of Byzacena had presented and read their letters of legation, and Lucian and Silvanus, legates of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis, had done the same, the bishop Aurelius said:  Let the text of these writings be placed in the acts.</p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p14"></a>Of the Byzacene bishops.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p15"></a>Numidius, the bishop, said:  We observe that our brethren and fellow bishops of the province of Byzacena and of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis have sent legates to the council; we now seek whether the legates of Numidia have come, or at least of the province of Tripoli or of Mauritania-Cæsariensis.</p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p16"></a>Of the bishops of Mauritania Sitiphensis.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p17"></a>Lucian and Silvanus, the bishops, legates of the Province of Mauritania Sitiphensis said:  The tractory came late to our Cæsarian brethren or they would have been here; and they will certainly come, and we are confident of their attitude of mind that whatever shall be determined by this council, they without doubt will assent unto.</p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p18"></a>Of the bishops of Numidia.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p19"></a>Alypius, bishop of the church of Tagaste said:  We have come from Numidia, I and the holy brethren Augustine and Possidius, but a legation could not be sent from Numidia, because by the tumult of the recruits the bishops have either been prevented from coming or fully occupied by their own necessary affairs in their sees.  For after I had brought to the holy Senex Xantippus your holinesss tractory, this seemed good in the present business that a council should be appointed, to which a delegation with instructions should be sent, but when I reported to him in later letters the impediment of the recruits, of which I have just spoken, he excused them by his own rescripts.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  There is no doubt that the aforesaid brethren and bishops of Numidia, when they shall have received the acts of the council, will give their consent and will take pains to carry into effect whatever shall have been adopted.  It is therefore necessary that by the solicitude of this see what we shall have determined be communicated to them.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xci-p21"></a>This is what I could learn concerning our brethren of Tripoli, that they appointed our brother Dulcicius as a legate: but because he could not come, certain of our sons coming from the aforesaid province asserted that the aforesaid had taken shipping, and that it was thought that his arrival had been delayed by storms; nevertheless also concerning these matters, if your charity is willing, this form shall be preserved, that the placets of the council be sent to them.  And all the bishops said:  What your holiness has decreed pleases us all.</p>
