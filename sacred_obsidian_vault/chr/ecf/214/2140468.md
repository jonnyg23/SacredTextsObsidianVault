 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p2.1"></a>Following</span> the canonical laws of the Fathers, we decree concerning infants, as often as they are found without trusty witnesses who say that they are undoubtedly baptized; and as often as they are themselves unable on account of their age to answer satisfactorily in respect to the initiatory mystery given to them; that they ought without any offence to be baptized, lest such a doubt might deprive them of the sanctification of such a purification.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p5"></a>Whoever do not know nor can prove by documents that they have been baptized, let them be christened.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p6"></a>This is canon VII., of the Sixth Council of Carthage, (<i>Vide</i> Hefele, <i>Hist. of the Councils</i>, Vol. II., p. 424); and Canon lxxv., of the African code (to which Balsam on attributes this canon), by the Greek numbering, (lxxii. by the Latin).</p>
