 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p14"></a>The present canon agrees with Canon V. of Nice and with Canon IV. of Antioch, on which canons see the notes.  The Synods approbation of this canon is found in Dionysius, Isidore, and in the Roman Codex <i>apud</i> Hervetus; but it is lacking from Balsamon and Zonaras.</p>
