 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.v-p7"></a>There are two sorts of catechumens.  For some have only just come in and these, as still imperfect, go out immediately after the reading of the scriptures and of the Gospels.  But there are others who have been for some time in preparation and have attained some perfection; these wait after the Gospel for the prayers for the catechumens, and when they hear the words “Catechumens, bow down your heads to the Lord,” they kneel down.  These, as being more perfect, having tasted the good words of God, if they fall, are removed from their position; and are placed with the “hearers”; but if any happen to sin while “hearers” they are cast out of the Church altogether.</p>
