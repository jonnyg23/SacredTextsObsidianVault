 </p><p class="c34"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p1"></a> <span class="c4"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p1.1"></a>Canon LXXI.</span></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p2.1"></a>Those</span> who are taught the civil laws must not adopt the customs of the Gentiles, nor be induced to go to the theatre, nor to keep what are called <i>Cylestras</i>, nor to wear clothing contrary to the general custom; and this holds good when they begin their training, when they reach its end, and, in short, all the time of its duration.  If any one from this time shall dare to do contrary to this canon he is to be cut off.</p>

 <p class="c36"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p4.1"></a>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXI.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p5"></a>Whoever devotes himself to the study of law, uses the manner of the Gentiles, going to the theatre, and rolling in the dust, or dressing differently to custom, shall be cut off.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6"></a>Liddell and Scott identify <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.1"></a>καλίστρα</span> with <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.2"></a>καλινδήθρα</span> ,which they define as “a place for horses to roll after exercise,” and note that it is a synonym of <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.3"></a>ἀλινδήθρα</span>.  But it is interesting to note that <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.4"></a>ἀλίνησις</span> is “a rolling in the dust, an exercise in which wrestlers rolled on the ground.”</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.lxxii-p7"></a>Hefele says that Balsamon and Zonaras have not been able rightly to explain what we are to understand by the forbidden “Cylestras,” but I think Johnson is not far out of the way when he translates “nor to meddle with athletic exercises.”</p>
