 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-p7"></a>Several heretics, for instance Bardesanes, Paul of Samosata, and Apollinaris—had composed psalms, <i>i.e</i>., Church hymns.  The Synod of Laodicea forbade the use of any composed by private individuals, namely all unauthorized Church hymns.  Lüft remarks that by this it was not intended to forbid the use of all but the Bible psalms and hymns, for it is known that even after this Synod many hymns composed by individual Chris<a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a> <a name="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-Page_159"></a>tians, for instance, Prudentius, Clement, Ambrose, came into use in the Church.  Only those not sanctioned were to be banished.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-p8"></a>This idea was greatly exaggerated by some Gallicans in the seventeenth century who wished that all the Antiphons, etc., should be in the words of Holy Scripture.  A learned but somewhat distorted account of this whole matter will be found in the <i>Institutions Liturgiques</i> by Dom Prosper Guéranger, tome ij., and a shorter but more temperate account in Dr. Batiffols <i>Histoire du Bréviaire Romain</i>, Chap. vj.</p>
