 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p2.1"></a>Concerning</span> those who call themselves Cathari, if they come over to the Catholic and Apostolic Church, the great and holy Synod decrees that they who are ordained shall continue as they are in the clergy.  But it is before all things necessary that they should profess in writing that they will observe and follow the dogmas of the Catholic and Apostolic Church; in particular that they will communicate with persons who have been twice married, and with those who having lapsed in persecution have had a period [of <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> <a name="vii.vi.xii-Page_20"></a>penance] laid upon them, and a time [of restoration] fixed so that in all things they will follow the dogmas of the Catholic Church.  Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in cities, all of the ordained are found to be of these only, let them remain in the clergy, and in the same rank in which they are found.  But if they come over where there is a bishop or presbyter of the Catholic Church, it is manifest that the Bishop of the Church must have the bishops dignity; and he who was named bishop by those who are called Cathari shall have the rank of presbyter, unless it shall seem fit to the Bishop to admit him to partake in the honour of the title.  Or, if this should not be satisfactory, then shall the bishop provide for him a place as Chorepiscopus, or presbyter, in order that he may be evidently seen to be of the clergy, and that there may not be two bishops in the city.</p>

 <p class="c30"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p4.1"></a>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p5"></a>If those called Cathari come over, let them first make profession that they are willing to communicate with the twice married, and to grant pardon to the lapsed.  And on this condition he who happens to be in orders, shall continue in the same order, so that a bishop shall still be bishop.  Whoever was a bishop among the Cathari let him, however, become a Chorepiscopus, or let him enjoy the honour of a presbyter or of a bishop.  For in one church there shall not be two bishops.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p6"></a>The Cathari or Novatians were the followers of Novatian, a presbyter of Rome, who had been a Stoic philosopher and was delivered, according to his own story, from diabolical possession at his exorcising by the Church before his baptism, when becoming a Catechumen.  Being in peril of death by illness he received clinical baptism, and was ordained priest without any further sacred rites being administered to him.  During the persecution he constantly refused to assist his brethren, and afterwards raised his voice against what he considered their culpable laxity in admitting to penance the lapsed.  Many agreed with him in this, especially of the clergy, and eventually, in <span class="sc"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p6.1"></a>a.d.</span> 251, he induced three bishops to consecrate him, thus becoming, as Fleury remarks, <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
  “the first Anti-Pope.”  His indignation was principally spent upon Pope Cornelius, and to overthrow the prevailing discipline of the Church he ordained bishops and sent them to different parts of the empire as the disseminators of his error.  It is well to remember that while beginning only as a schismatic, he soon fell into heresy, denying that the Church had the power to absolve the lapsed.  Although condemned by several councils his sect continued on, and like the Montanists they rebaptized Catholics who apostatized to them, and absolutely rejected all second marriages.  At the time of the Council of Nice the Novatian bishop at Constantinople, Acesius, was greatly esteemed, and although a schismatic, was invited to attend the council.  After having in answer to the emperors enquiry whether he was willing to sign the Creed, assured him that he was, he went on to explain that his separation was because the Church no longer observed the ancient discipline which forbade that those who had committed mortal sin should ever be readmitted to communion.  According to the Novatians he might be exhorted to repentance, but the Church had no power to assure him of forgiveness but must leave him to the judgment of God.  It was then that Constantine said, “Acesius, take a ladder, and climb up to heaven alone.” <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p10"></a>If any of them be bishops or chorepiscopi they shall remain in the same rank, unless perchance in the same city there be found a bishop of the Catholic Church, ordained before their coming.  For in this case he that was properly bishop from the first shall have the preference, and he alone shall retain the Episcopal throne.  For it is not right that in the same city there should be two bishops.  But he who by the Cathari was called bishop, shall be honoured as a presbyter, or (if it so please the bishop), he shall be sharer of the title bishop; but he shall exercise no episcopal jurisdiction.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p11"></a>Zonaras, Balsamon, Beveridge and Van Espen, are of opinion that <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p11.1"></a>χειροθετουμένους</span> does not mean that they are to receive a new laying on of hands at their reception into the Church, but that it refers to their already condition of being ordained, the meaning being that as they have had Novatian ordination they must be reckoned among the clergy.  Dionysius Exiguus takes a different view, as does also the <i>Prisca</i> version, according to which the <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a> <a name="vii.vi.xii-Page_21"></a>clergy of the Novatians were to receive a laying on of hands, <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p11.2"></a>χειροθετουμένους</span>, but that it was not to be a reordination.  With this interpretation Hefele seems to agree, founding his opinion upon the fact that the article is wanting before <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p11.3"></a>χειροθετουμένους</span>, and that <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xii-p11.4"></a>αὐτοὺς</span> is added.  Gratian <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a>
  supposes that this eighth canon orders a re-ordination.</p>
