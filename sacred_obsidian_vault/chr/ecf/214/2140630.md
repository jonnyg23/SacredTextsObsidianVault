 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p2"></a><i>That those who are going to carry their case to court should be careful to inform either the bishop of Carthage or</i> <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">478</font></a>
  <i>the bishop of Rome.</i></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p4.1"></a>It</span> seemed good that whoever wished to go to court, should give notice in the form which is sent to the Church of the city of Rome, that from thence also he should receive a formed letter to court.  But if receiving only a formed letter to Rome, and saying nothing about the necessity which he had of going to court, he willed immediately to go thither, let him be cut off from communion.  But if while at Rome the necessity of going to court suddenly arose, let him state his necessity to the bishop of Rome and let him carry with him a rescript of the same Roman bishop.  But let the formed letters which are issued by primates and by certain bishops to their own clergy have the date of Easter; but if it be yet uncertain what is the date of Easter of that year, let the preceding Easters date be set down, as it is customary to date public acts after the consulship.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p5"></a>It further seemed good that those who were sent as delegates from this glorious council should ask of the most glorious princes whatever they saw would be useful against the Donatists and Pagans, and their superstitions.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p6"></a>It also seemed good to all the bishops that all conciliar letters be signed by your holiness alone.  And they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and having read it, now subscribe my name.  Likewise also the rest of the bishops subscribed.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p8"></a>Whoever from any necessity was going to court, must declare his intention to the bishop of Carthage and to the bishop of Rome, and receive a letter dimissory, and otherwise he shall be excommunicated.</p> 
 <p class="c39"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p9"></a>Whatever shall seem to the legates useful against the Donatists and Greeks, and their superstitions, that shall be sought from the Emperor.</p>
