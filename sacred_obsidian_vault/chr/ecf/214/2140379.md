 <p class="c18"><a name="xiii.xiv-p2"></a>In the name of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour, the most pious Emperor, the peaceful and Christ-loving Constantine, an Emperor faithful to God in Jesus Christ, to all our Christ-loving people living in this God-preserved and royal city.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiii.xiv-p3"></a>[<i>The document is very long, Hefele gives the following epitome, which is all sufficient for the ordinary reader, who will remember that it is an Edict of the Emperor and not anything proceeding from the council</i>.]</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiii.xiv-p4"></a><i>Hefeles Epitome</i> (<i>Hist. of the Councils</i>, Vol. v., p. 178).</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiii.xiv-p5"></a>“The heresy of Apollinaris, etc., has been renewed by Theodore of Pharan and confirmed by Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, who also contradicted himself.  Also Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Paul, Peter; more recently.  Macarius, Stephen, and Polychronius had diffused Monothelitism.  He, the Emperor, had therefore convoked this holy and Ecumenical Synod, and published the present edict with the confession of faith, in order to confirm and establish its decrees.  (There follows here an extended confession of faith, with proofs for the doctrine of two wills and operations.)  As he recognized the five earlier Ecumenical Synods, so he anathematized all heretics from Simon Magus, but especially the originator and patrons of the new heresy, Theodore and Sergius; also Pope Honorius, who was their adherent and patron in everything, and confirmed the heresy (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiii.xiv-p5.1"></a>τὸν κατὰ πάντα τούτοις συναιρέτην καὶ σύνδρομον καὶ βεβαιωτὴν τῆς αἱρέσεως</span>, further, Cyrus, etc., and ordained that no one henceforth should hold a different faith, or venture to teach one will and one energy.  In no other than the orthodox faith could men be saved.  Whoever did not obey the imperial edict should, if he were a bishop or cleric be deposed; if an official, punished with confiscation of property and loss of the girdle (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiii.xiv-p5.2"></a>ζώνη</span>); if a private person, banished from the residence and all other cities.”</p>
