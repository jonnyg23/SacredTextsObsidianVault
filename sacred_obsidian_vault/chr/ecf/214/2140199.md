 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7"></a>Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i>, Lib. IX., Cap. X.) employs the expression <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7.1"></a>κυριακά</span> in the same sense as does this canon as identical with churches.  The prohibition itself, however, here given, as well as the preceding canon, proves that as early as the time of the Synod of Laodicea, many irregularities had crept into the <i>agape</i>.  For the rest, this Synod was not in a position permanently to banish the usage from the Church; for which reason the Trullan Synod in its seventy-fourth canon repeated this rule word for word.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p8"></a>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratians <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Disk XLII., c. iv.</p>
