 <p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p4.1"></a>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p5"></a>A chorepiscopus is not to ordain without the consent of the bishop.</p> 
 <p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p6"></a><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p6.1"></a>Hefele.</span></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7"></a>If the first part of the thirteenth canon is easy to understand, the second, on the contrary, presents a great difficulty; for a priest of a town could not in any case have the power of consecrating priests and deacons, least of all in a strange diocese.  Many of the most learned men have, for this reason, supposed that the Greek text of the second half of the canon, as we have read it, is incorrect or defective.  It wants, say they, <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.1"></a>ποιεῖν τι</span>, or <i>aliquid agere, i.e., to complete a religious function</i>.  To confirm this supposition, they have appealed to several ancient versions, especially to that of Isidore:  <i>sed nec presbyteris civitatis sine episcopi præcepto amplius aliquid imperare, vel sine auctoritate literarum ejus in unaquaque</i> (some read <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.2"></a>ἐν ἐκάστῃ</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.3"></a>ἐν ἑτέρᾳ</span>) <i>parochia aliquid agere</i>.  The ancient Roman <span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.4"></a>ms.</span> of the canons, <i>Codex Canonum</i>, has the same <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a> <a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-Page_69"></a>reading, only that it has <i>provincia</i> instead of <i>parochia</i>.  Fulgentius Ferrandus, deacon of Carthage, who long ago made a collection of canons, translates in the same way in his <i>Breviatio Canonum</i>:  <i>Ut presbyteri civitatis sine jussu episcopi nihil jubeant, nec in unaquaque parochia aliquid agant</i>.  Van Espen has explained this canon in the same way.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8"></a>Routh has given another interpretation.  He maintained that there was not a word missing in this canon, but that at the commencement one ought to read, according to several <span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.1"></a>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.2"></a>χωρεπισκόποις</span> in the dative, and further down <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.3"></a>ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.4"></a>ἀλλα μηδὲ</span> then <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.5"></a>πρεσβυτέρους</span> (in the accusative) <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.6"></a>πόλεως</span> and finally <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.7"></a>ἐκάστῃ</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.8"></a>ἑτέρᾳ</span>, and that we must therefore translate, “<i>Chorepiscopi</i> are not permitted to consecrate priests and deacons (for the country) still less (<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.9"></a>ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ</span>) can they consecrate priests for the town without the consent of the bishop of the place.”  The Greek text, thus modified according to some <span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.10"></a>mss.</span>, especially those in the Bodleian Library, certainly gives a good meaning.  Still <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.11"></a>ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ</span> does not mean, <i>but still less</i>:  it means, <i>but certainly not</i>, which makes a considerable difference.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p9"></a>Besides this, it can very seldom have happened that the <i>chorepiscopi</i> ordained presbyters or deacons for a town; and if so, they were already forbidden, at least implicitly, in the first part of the canon.</p>
