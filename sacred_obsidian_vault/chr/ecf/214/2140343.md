 <p class="c35"><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p5"></a>Let the ordination of bishops be within three months:  necessity however may make the time longer.  But if anyone shall ordain counter to this decree, he shall be liable to punishment.  The revenue shall remain with the œconomus.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p7"></a>The “Steward of the Church” was to “take care of the revenues of the church widowed” by the death of its bishop, who was regarded as representing Him to whom the whole Church was espoused (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023">Eph. v. 23</a><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p7.1"></a> ff.).  So in the “order of the holy and great church” of St. Sophia, the “Great Steward” is described as “taking the oversight of the widowed church” (Goar, <i>Eucholog</i>., p. 269); so Hincmar says:  “Si fuerit defunctus episcopus, ego…visitatorem ipsi viduatæ designabo ecclesiæ; “and the phrase, “viduata per mortem N. nuper episcopi” became common in the West (F. G. Lee, <i>Validity of English Orders</i>, p. 373).  The episcopal ring was a symbol of the same idea.  So at St. Chrysostoms restoration Eudoxia claimed to have “given back the bridegroom” (<i>Serm. post redit</i>., iv.).  So Bishop Wilson told Queen Caroline that he “would not leave his wife in his old age because she was poor” (Kebles <i>Life of Wilson</i>, ii., 767); and Peter Mongus, having invaded the Alexandrian see while its legitimate occupant, Timothy Salophaciolus, was alive, was expelled as an “adulterer” (Liberatus, <i>Breviar</i>., xviij.).</p>
