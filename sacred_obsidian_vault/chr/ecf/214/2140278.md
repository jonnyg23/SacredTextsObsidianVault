 <p class="c31"><a name="x.xii-p2"></a><span class="c4"><a name="x.xii-p2.1"></a>Session II.</span></p> 
 <p class="c31"><a name="x.xii-p3"></a>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. III., col. 609.)</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="x.xii-p4"></a>The most pious and God-beloved bishops, Arcadius and Projectus, as also the most beloved-of-God Philip, a presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See, then entered and took their seats. <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">258</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p6"></a>Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said:  We bless the holy and adorable Trinity that our lowliness has been deemed worthy to attend your holy Synod.  For a long time ago (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p6.1"></a>πάλαι</span>) our most holy and blessed pope Cœlestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, through his letters to that holy and most pious man Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, gave judgment concerning the present cause and affair (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p6.2"></a>ὥρισεν</span>) which letters have been shown to your holy assembly.  And now again for the corroboration of the Catholic (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p6.3"></a>καθολικῆς</span>) faith, he has sent through us letters to all your holinesses, which you will bid (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p6.4"></a>κελούσατε</span>) to be read with becoming reverence (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p6.5"></a>πρεπόντως</span>) and to be entered on the ecclesiastical minutes.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="x.xii-p7"></a>Arcadius, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said:  May it please your blessedness to give order that the letters of the holy and ever-to-be-mentioned-with-veneration Pope Cœlestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, which have been brought by us, be read, from which your reverence will be able to see what care he has for all the Churches.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p8"></a>Projectus, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said, May it please, etc.  [<i>The same as Arcadius had said</i> verbatim!]</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p9"></a>And afterwards the most holy and beloved-of-God Cyril, bishop of the Church of Alexandria, spoke as is next in order contained; Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p9.1"></a>καθολικῆς</span>) Church of Rome read it.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p10"></a>Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said:  Let the letter received from the most holy and altogether most blessed Cœlestine, bishop of the Apostolic See of Rome be read to the holy Synod with fitting honour.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p11"></a>Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.xii-p11.1"></a>καθολικῆς</span>) Church of the city of Rome read it.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="x.xii-p12"></a>And after it was read in Latin, Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said:  Let the writings of the most holy and blessed bishop of great Rome which have just been read, be entered on the minutes.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p13"></a>And all the most reverend bishops prayed that the letter might be translated and read.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p14"></a>Philip, the presbyter of the Apostolic See and Legate said:  The custom has been sufficiently complied with, that the writings of the Apostolic See should first be read in Latin. <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">259</font></a>
   But now since your holiness has <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a> <a name="x.xii-Page_220"></a>demanded that they be read in Greek also, it is necessary that your holinesss desire should be satisfied; We have taken care that this be done, and that the Latin be turned into Greek.  Give order therefore that it be received and read in your holy hearing.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="x.xii-p16"></a>Arcadius and Projectus, bishops and legates said, As your blessedness ordered that the writings which we brought should be brought to the knowledge of all, for of our holy brethren bishops there are not a few who do not understand Latin, therefore the letter has been translated into Greek and if you so command let it be read.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p17"></a>Flavian, the bishop of Philippi said:  Let the translation of the letter of the most holy and beloved of God, bishop of the Roman Church be received and read.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="x.xii-p18"></a>Peter, the presbyter of Alexandria and primicerius of the notaries read as follows:</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="x.xii-p5"></a> It should be noted that in the Acts Cyril is described as having “the place of the most holy and sacred Archbishop of the Roman Church Cœlestine.”  Hefele says “that Cyril presided as Popes vicar is asserted also by Mennas of Constantinople and other Greek bishops in their letter to Pope Vigilius, in Mansi, t. ix., p. 62; Hardouin, t. iii., p. 10.”  (Hef., <i>Hist. of the Councils</i>, Vol. III., p. 46, n. 4.)</p>
 <a name="fn_258"></a><a href="2140278.htm#fr_258">219:259</a> <a name="x.xii-p14.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="x.xii-p15"></a> This seems to me to be the climax of improbable statements.  There are many other things which will induce the curious reader to suspect that the Acts are not in good shape.</p>
