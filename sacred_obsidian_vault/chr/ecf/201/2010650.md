 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.lxiv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.lxiv-p2.1"></a>All</span> these events occurred during a most important festival, I mean the august and holy solemnity of Pentecost, which is distinguished by a period of seven weeks, and sealed with that one day on which the holy Scriptures attest, the ascension of our common Saviour into heaven, and the descent of the Holy Spirit among men. In the course of this feast the emperor received the privileges I have described; and on the last day of all, which one might justly call the feast of feasts, he was removed about mid-day to the presence of his God, leaving his mortal remains to his fellow mortals, and carrying into fellowship with God that part of his being which was capable of understanding and loving him. <a name="fr_3361"></a><a href="#fn_3361"><font size="1">3362</font></a>
