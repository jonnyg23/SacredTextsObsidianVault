 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter LXVIII</span>.—<i>Being grieved by the Dissension, he counsels Peace.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxviii-p2.1"></a>But</span>, O glorious Providence of God! how deep a wound did not my ears only, but my very heart receive in the report that divisions existed among yourselves more grievous still than those which continued in that country! <a name="fr_3213"></a><a href="#fn_3213"><font size="1">3214</font></a>
  so that you, through whose aid I had hoped to procure a remedy for the errors of others, are in a state which needs healing even more than theirs. And yet, having made a careful enquiry into the origin and foundation of these differences, I find the cause to be of a truly insignificant character, and quite unworthy of such fierce contention. Feeling myself, therefore, compelled to address you in this letter, and to appeal at the same time to your unanimity <a name="fr_3214"></a><a href="#fn_3214"><font size="1">3215</font></a>
  and sagacity, I call on Divine Providence to assist me in the task, while I interrupt your dissension in the character of a minister of peace. And with reason: for if I might expect, with the help of a higher Power, to be able without difficulty, by a judicious appeal to the pious feelings of those who heard me, to recall them to a better spirit, even though the occasion of the disagreement were a greater one, how can I refrain from promising myself a far easier and more speedy adjustment of this difference, when the cause which hinders general harmony of sentiment is intrinsically trifling and of little moment?</p>
