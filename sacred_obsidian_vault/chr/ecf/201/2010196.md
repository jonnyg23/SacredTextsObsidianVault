 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p2.1"></a>It</span> was in the tenth year of the above-mentioned reign that Origen removed from Alexandria to Cæsarea, <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
  leaving the charge of the catechetical school in that city to Heraclas. Not long afterward Demetrius, bishop of the church of Alexandria, died, having held the office for forty-three full years, <a name="fr_1996"></a><a href="#fn_1996"><font size="1">1997</font></a>
  and Heraclas succeeded him. At this time Firmilianus, <a name="fr_1997"></a><a href="#fn_1997"><font size="1">1998</font></a>
  bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, was conspicuous.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p5"></a> Firmilian, bishop of Cæsarea, the capital of Cappadocia (to be distinguished from Cæsarea in Palestine), was one of the most famous prelates of his day in the Eastern Church. He was a friend of Origen, as we learn from the next chapter, and took part in a council called on account of the schism of Novatian (see chap. 46), and also in councils called to consider the case of Paul of Samosata (see Bk. VII. chaps. 28 and 30). He was one of the bishops whom Stephen excommunicated because they rebaptized heretics (see Bk. VII. chap. 2, note 3, and chap. 5, note 4), and he wrote an epistle upon this subject to Cyprian, which is extant in a Latin translation made by Cyprian himself (<i>Ep.</i> 74, <i>al.</i> 75, in the collection of Cyprians epistles. See <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> I. 751, note). Basil (<i>de Spiritu Sancto,</i> 29) refers to works (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.1"></a>λόγοι</span>) left by Firmilian, but none of them are extant except the single epistle mentioned, nor do we hear from any other source that he was a writer. Jerome does not mention him in his <i>De vir. ill.</i> The exact date of his accession is unknown to us, as it very likely was to Eusebius also. He was a bishop already in the tenth year of Alexander (231 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.2"></a>a.d.</span>), or very soon afterward, and from Bk. VII. chap. 30, we learn that he died at Tarsus on his way to Antioch to attend a council which had been summoned to deal with Paul of Samosata. This synod was held about 265 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xxvi-p5.3"></a>a.d.</span> (not in 272 as is commonly supposed; see Bk. VII. chap. 29, note 1), and it is at this time, therefore, that we must put the death of Firmilian; so that he was bishop of Cæsarea at least some thirty-four years.</p>
