 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.x-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>The Writer denounces Idols, and glorifies God.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.x-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.iv.x-p2.1"></a>This</span> God I invoke with bended knees, and recoil with horror from the blood of sacrifices, from their foul and detestable odors, and from every earth-born magic fire: <a name="fr_3314"></a><a href="#fn_3314"><font size="1">3315</font></a>
  for the profane and impious superstitions which are defiled by these rites have cast down and consigned to perdition many, nay, whole nations of the Gentile world. For he who is Lord of all cannot endure that those blessings which, in his own loving-kindness and consideration of the wants of men, he has revealed for the use of all, should be perverted to serve the lusts of any. His only demand from man is purity of mind and an undefiled spirit; and by this standard he weighs the actions of virtue and godliness. For his pleasure is in works of moderation and gentleness: he loves the meek, and hates the turbulent spirit: delighting in faith, he chastises unbelief: by him all presumptuous power is broken down, and he avenges the insolence of the proud. While the arrogant and haughty are utterly overthrown, he requires the humble and forgiving with deserved rewards: even so does he highly honor and strengthen with his special help a kingdom justly governed, and maintains a prudent king in the tranquillity of peace.</p>
