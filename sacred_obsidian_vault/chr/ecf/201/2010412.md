 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVII</span>.—<i>That after reflecting on the Downfall of those who had worshiped Idols, he made Choice of Christianity.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxvii-p2.1"></a>Being</span> convinced, however, that he needed some more powerful aid than his military forces could afford him, on account of the wicked and magical enchantments which were so diligently practiced by the tyrant, <a name="fr_3103"></a><a href="#fn_3103"><font size="1">3104</font></a>
  he sought Divine assistance, deeming the possession of arms and a numerous soldiery of secondary importance, but believing the co-operating power of Deity invincible and not to be shaken. He considered, therefore, on what God he might rely for protection and assistance. While engaged in this enquiry, the thought occurred to him, that, of the many emperors who had preceded him, those who had rested their hopes in a multitude of gods, and served them with sacrifices and offerings, had in the first place been deceived by flattering predictions, and oracles which promised them all prosperity, and at last had met with an unhappy end, while not one of their gods had stood by to warn them of the impending wrath of heaven; while one alone who had pursued an entirely opposite course, who had condemned their error, and honored the one Supreme God during his whole life, had found him to be the Saviour and Protector of his empire, and the Giver of every good thing. Reflecting on this, and well weighing the fact that they who had trusted in many gods had also fallen by manifold forms of death, without leaving behind them either family or offspring, stock, name, or memorial among men: while the God of his father had given to him, on the other hand, manifestations of his power and very many tokens: and considering farther that those who had already taken arms against the tyrant, and had marched to the battle-field under the protection of a multitude of gods, had met with a dishonorable end (for one of them <a name="fr_3104"></a><a href="#fn_3104"><font size="1">3105</font></a>
  had shamefully retreated from the contest without a blow, and the other, <a name="fr_3105"></a><a href="#fn_3105"><font size="1">3106</font></a>
  being slain in the midst of <a name="page_490"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 490</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xxvii-Page_490"></a>his own troops, became, as it were, the mere sport of death <a name="fr_3106"></a><a href="#fn_3106"><font size="1">3107</font></a>
 ); reviewing, I say, all these considerations, he judged it to be folly indeed to join in the idle worship of those who were no gods, and, after such convincing evidence, to err from the truth; and therefore felt it incumbent on him to honor his fathers God alone.</p>
