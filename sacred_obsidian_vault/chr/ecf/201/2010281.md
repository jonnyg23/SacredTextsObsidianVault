 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xiv.xi-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xiv.xi-p2.1"></a>On</span> the fourteenth day of the following month Appellæus, <a name="fr_2672"></a><a href="#fn_2672"><font size="1">2673</font></a>
  the nineteenth before the Kalends of January, certain persons from Egypt were again seized by those who examined people passing the gates. They had been sent to minister to the confessors in Cilicia. They received the same sentence as those whom they had gone to help, being mutilated in their eyes and feet. Three of them exhibited in Ascalon, where they were imprisoned, marvelous bravery in the endurance of various kinds of martyrdom. One of them named Ares was condemned to the flames, and the others, called Probus <a name="fr_2673"></a><a href="#fn_2673"><font size="1">2674</font></a>
  and Elias, were beheaded.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.xi-p5"></a>2. On the eleventh day of the month Audynæus, <a name="fr_2674"></a><a href="#fn_2674"><font size="1">2675</font></a>
  which is the third before the Ides of January, in the same city of Cæsarea, Peter an ascetic, also called Apselamus, <a name="fr_2675"></a><a href="#fn_2675"><font size="1">2676</font></a>
  from the village of Anea, <a name="fr_2676"></a><a href="#fn_2676"><font size="1">2677</font></a>
  on the borders of Eleutheropolis, like purest gold, gave noble proof by fire of his faith in the Christ of God. Though the judge and those around him besought him many times to have compassion on himself, and to spare his own youth and bloom, he disregarded them, preferring hope in the God of the universe to all things, even to life itself. A certain Asclepius, supposed to be <a name="fr_2677"></a><a href="#fn_2677"><font size="1">2678</font></a>
  a bishop of the sect of Marcion, possessed as he thought with zeal for religion, but “not according to knowledge,” <a name="fr_2678"></a><a href="#fn_2678"><font size="1">2679</font></a>
  ended his life on one and the same funeral pyre. These things took place in this manner.</p>
