 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxix-p2.1"></a>Having</span> then at this time sung these and suchlike praises to God, the Ruler of all and the Author of victory, after the example of his great servant Moses, Constantine entered the imperial city in triumph. And here the whole body of the senate, and others of rank and distinction in the city, freed as it were from the restraint of a prison, along with the whole Roman populace, their countenances expressive of the gladness of their hearts, received him with acclamations and abounding joy; men, women, and children, with countless multitudes of servants, greeting him as deliverer, preserver, and benefactor, with incessant shouts. But he, being possessed of inward piety toward God, was neither rendered arrogant by these plaudits, nor uplifted by the praises he heard: <a name="fr_3135"></a><a href="#fn_3135"><font size="1">3136</font></a>
