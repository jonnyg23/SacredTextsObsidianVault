 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2.1"></a>Hence</span> it was not without reason that once, on the occasion of his entertaining a company of bishops, he let fall the expression, “that he himself too was a bishop,” addressing them in my hearing in the following words: “You are bishops whose jurisdiction is within the Church: I also am a bishop, ordained by God to overlook whatever is external to the Church.” <a name="fr_3323"></a><a href="#fn_3323"><font size="1">3324</font></a>
  And truly his measures corresponded with his words: for he watched over his subjects with an episcopal care, and exhorted them as far as in him lay to follow a godly life.</p>
