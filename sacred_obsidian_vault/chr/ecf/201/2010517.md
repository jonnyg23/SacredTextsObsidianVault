 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxxii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter LXXII</span>.—<i>The Excess of his Pious Concern caused him to shed Tears; and his Intended Journey to the East was postponed because of These Things.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxxii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxxii-p2.1"></a>Restore</span> me then my quiet days, and untroubled nights, that the joy of undimmed light, the delight of a tranquil life, may henceforth be my portion. Else must I needs mourn, with constant tears, nor shall I be able to pass the residue of my days in peace. For while the people of God, whose fellow-servant I am, are thus divided amongst themselves by an unreasonable and pernicious spirit of contention, how is it possible that I shall be able to maintain tranquillity of mind? And I will give you a proof how great my sorrow has been on this behalf. Not long since I had visited Nicomedia, and intended forthwith to proceed from that city to the East. It was while I was hastening towards you, and had already accomplished the greater part of the distance, that the news of this matter reversed my plan, that I might not be compelled to see with my own eyes that which I felt myself scarcely able even to hear. Open then for me henceforward by your unity of judgment that road to the regions of the East which your dissensions have closed against me, and permit me speedily to see yourselves and all other peoples rejoicing together, and render due acknowledgment to God in the language of praise and thanksgiving for the restoration of general concord and liberty to all.”</p>
