 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXI</span>.—<i>A Description of the Standard of the Cross, which the Romans now call the Labarum.</i> <a name="fr_3109"></a><a href="#fn_3109"><font size="1">3110</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p3.1"></a>Now</span> it was made in the following manner. A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the <a name="page_491"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 491</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-Page_491"></a>figure of the cross by means of a transverse bar laid over it. On the top of the whole was fixed a wreath of gold and precious stones; and within this, <a name="fr_3110"></a><a href="#fn_3110"><font size="1">3111</font></a>
  the symbol of the Saviours name, two letters indicating the name of Christ by means of its initial characters, the letter P being intersected by X in its centre: <a name="fr_3111"></a><a href="#fn_3111"><font size="1">3112</font></a>
  and these letters the emperor was in the habit of wearing on his helmet at a later period. From the cross-bar of the spear was suspended a cloth, <a name="fr_3112"></a><a href="#fn_3112"><font size="1">3113</font></a>
  a royal piece, covered with a profuse embroidery of most brilliant precious stones; and which, being also richly interlaced with gold, presented an indescribable degree of beauty to the beholder. This banner was of a square form, and the upright staff, whose lower section was of great length, <a name="fr_3113"></a><a href="#fn_3113"><font size="1">3114</font></a>
  bore a golden half-length portrait <a name="fr_3114"></a><a href="#fn_3114"><font size="1">3115</font></a>
  of the pious emperor and his children on its upper part, beneath the trophy of the cross, and immediately above the embroidered banner.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxi-p9"></a>The emperor constantly made use of this sign of salvation as a safeguard against every adverse and hostile power, and commanded that others similar to it should be carried at the head of all his armies.</p>
