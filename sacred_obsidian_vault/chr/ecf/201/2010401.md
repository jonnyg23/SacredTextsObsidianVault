 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XVI</span>.—<i>How Constantius, feigning Idolatry, expelled those who consented to offer Sacrifice, but retained in his Palace all who were willing to confess Christ.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-p2.1"></a>On</span> the other hand, Constantius conceived an expedient full of sagacity, and did a thing which sounds paradoxical, but in fact was most admirable.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-p3"></a>He made a proposal to all the officers of his court, including even those in the highest stations of authority, offering them the following alternative: either that they should offer sacrifice to demons, and thus be permitted to remain with him, and enjoy their usual honors; or, in case of refusal, that they should be shut out from all access to his person, and entirely disqualified from acquaintance and association with him. Accordingly, when they had individually made their choice, some one way and some the other; and the choice of each had been ascertained, then this admirable prince disclosed the secret meaning of his expedient, and condemned the cowardice and selfishness of the one party, while he highly commended the other for their conscientious devotion to God. He declared, too, that those who had been false to their God must be unworthy of the confidence of their prince; for how was it possible that they should preserve their fidelity to him, who had proved themselves faithless to a higher power? He determined, therefore, that such persons should be removed altogether from the imperial court, while, on the other hand, declaring that those men who, in bearing witness for the truth, had proved them<a name="page_487"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 487</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xvi-Page_487"></a>selves to be worthy servants of God, would manifest the same fidelity to their king, he entrusted them with the guardianship of his person and empire, saying that he was bound to treat such persons with special regard as his nearest and most valued friends, and to esteem them far more highly than the richest treasures.</p>
