 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxii-p2.1"></a>Again</span>, with regard to those who have been condemned either to the grievous labor of the mines, or to service in the public works, let them enjoy the sweets of leisure in place of these long-continued toils, and henceforth lead a far easier life, and more accordant with the wishes of their hearts, exchanging the incessant hardships of their tasks for quiet relaxation. And if any have forfeited the common privilege of liberty, or have unhappily suffered dishonor, <a name="fr_3185"></a><a href="#fn_3185"><font size="1">3186</font></a>
  let them hasten back every one to the country of his nativity, and resume with becoming joy their former positions in society, from which they have been as it were separated by long residence abroad.</p>
