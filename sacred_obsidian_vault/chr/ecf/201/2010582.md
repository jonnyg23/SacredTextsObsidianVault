 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter LXIII</span>.—<i>How he displayed his Zeal for the Extirpation of Heresies.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-p2.1"></a>Such</span> were the exhortations to do all things to the honor of the divine religion which the emperor addressed to the rulers of the churches. Having by these means banished dissension, and <a name="page_539"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 539</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.lxiii-Page_539"></a>reduced the Church of God to a state of uniform harmony, he next proceeded to a different duty, feeling it incumbent on him to extirpate another sort of impious persons, as pernicious enemies of the human race. These were pests of society, who ruined whole cities under the specious garb of religious decorum; men whom our Saviours warning voice somewhere terms false prophets and ravenous wolves: “Beware of false prophets, which will come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them.” <a name="fr_3302"></a><a href="#fn_3302"><font size="1">3303</font></a>
  Accordingly, by an order transmitted to the governors of the several provinces, he effectually banished all such offenders. In addition to this ordinance he addressed to them personally a severely awakening admonition, exhorting them to an earnest repentance, that they might still find a haven of safety in the true Church of God. Hear, then, in what manner he addressed them in this letter.</p>
