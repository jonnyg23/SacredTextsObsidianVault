 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxv-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lxv-p2.1"></a>My</span> design then was, first, to bring the diverse judgments formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a condition, as it were, of settled uniformity; and, secondly, to restore to health the system of the world, then suffering under the malignant power of a grievous distemper.
