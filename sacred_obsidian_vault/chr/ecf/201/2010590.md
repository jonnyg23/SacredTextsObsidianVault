 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.iv-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>His Liberality, from His Private Resources, to the Losers in Suits of a Pecuniary Nature.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.iv-p2.1"></a>In</span> cases of judicial arbitration, in order that the loser by his decision might not quit his presence less contented than the victorious litigant, he himself bestowed, and from his own private means, in some cases lands, in other money, on the defeated party. In this manner he took care that the loser, as having appeared in his presence, should be as well satisfied as the gainer of the cause; for he considered that no one ought in any case to retire dejected and sorrowful from an interview with such a prince. <a name="fr_3309"></a><a href="#fn_3309"><font size="1">3310</font></a>
  Thus it happened that both parties returned from the scene of trial with glad and cheerful countenances, while the emperors noble-minded liberality excited universal admiration.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iv.iv-p3"></a> In reality it may have been less childish than Eusebius makes it appear, for it probably refers to cases where it was a matter of just equalization of claims, where each party thought his claim just.</p>
