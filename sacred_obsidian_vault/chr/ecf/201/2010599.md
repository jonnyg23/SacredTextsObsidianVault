 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XIII</span>.—<i>He bespeaks his Affectionate Interest for the Christians in his Country.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p2.1"></a>Imagine</span>, then, with what joy I heard tidings so accordant with my desire, that the fairest districts of Persia are filled with those men on whose behalf alone I am at present speaking, I <a name="page_544"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 544</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iv.xiii-Page_544"></a>mean the Christians. I pray, therefore, that both you and they may enjoy abundant prosperity, and that your blessings and theirs may be in equal measure; <a name="fr_3316"></a><a href="#fn_3316"><font size="1">3317</font></a>
  for thus you will experience the mercy and favor of that God who is the Lord and Father of all. And now, because your power is great, I commend these persons to your protection; because your piety is eminent, I commit them to your care. Cherish them with your wonted humanity and kindness; for by this proof of faith you will secure an immeasurable benefit both to yourself and us.”</p>
