 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1.1"></a>Chapter VII</span>.—<i>Of the General Council, at which Bishops from all Nations were Present.</i> <a name="fr_3237"></a><a href="#fn_3237"><font size="1">3238</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p3.1"></a>In</span> effect, the most distinguished of Gods ministers from all the churches which abounded in Europe, Lybia, <a name="fr_3238"></a><a href="#fn_3238"><font size="1">3239</font></a>
  and Asia were here assembled. And a single house of prayer, as though divinely enlarged, sufficed to contain at once Syrians and Cilicians, Phœnicians and Arabians, delegates from Palestine, and others from Egypt; Thebans and Libyans, with those who came from the region of Mesopotamia. A Persian bishop too was present at this conference, nor was even a Scythian found wanting to the number. <a name="fr_3239"></a><a href="#fn_3239"><font size="1">3240</font></a>
  Pontus, Galatia, and Pamphylia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Phrygia, furnished their most distinguished prelates; while those who dwelt in the remotest districts of Thrace and Macedonia, of Achaia and Epirus, were notwithstanding in attendance. Even from Spain itself, one whose fame was widely spread took his seat as an individual in the great assembly. <a name="fr_3240"></a><a href="#fn_3240"><font size="1">3241</font></a>
  The prelate of the imperial city <a name="fr_3241"></a><a href="#fn_3241"><font size="1">3242</font></a>
  was prevented from attending by extreme old age; but his presbyters were present, and supplied his place. Constantine is the first prince of any age who bound together such a garland as this with the bond of peace, and presented it to his Saviour as a thank-offering for the victories he had obtained over every foe, thus exhibiting in our own times a similitude of the apostolic company.</p>
