 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XI</span>.—<i>That his Present Object is to record only the Pious Actions of Constantine.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xi-p2.1"></a>It</span> is my intention, therefore, to pass over the greater part of the royal deeds of this thrice-blessed prince; as, for example, his conflicts and engagements in the field, his personal valor, his victories and successes against the enemy, and the many triumphs he obtained: likewise his provisions for the interests of individuals, his legislative enactments for the social advantage of his subjects, and a multitude of other imperial labors which are fresh in the memory of all; the design of my present undertaking being to speak and write of those circumstances only which have reference to his religious character.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.xi-p3"></a>And since these are themselves of almost infinite variety, I shall select from the facts <a name="page_485"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 485</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xi-Page_485"></a>which have come to my knowledge such as are most suitable, and worthy of lasting record, and endeavor to narrate them as briefly as possible. Henceforward, indeed, there is a full and free opportunity for celebrating in every way the praises of this truly blessed prince, which hitherto we have been unable to do, on the ground that we are forbidden to judge any one blessed before his death, <a name="fr_3073"></a><a href="#fn_3073"><font size="1">3074</font></a>
  because of the uncertain vicissitudes of life. Let me implore then the help of God, and may the inspiring aid of the heavenly Word be with me, while I commence my history from the very earliest period of his life.</p>
