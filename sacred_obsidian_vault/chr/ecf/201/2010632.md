 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLVI</span>.—<i>That Eusebius afterwards delivered his Description of the Church of the Saviour, and a Tricennial Oration before Constantine himself.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xlvi-p2.1"></a>The</span> structure of the church of our Saviour, the form of his sacred cave, the splendor of the work itself, and the numberless offerings in gold, and silver, and precious stones, I have described to the best of my ability, and dedicated to the emperor in a separate treatise, which on a fitting opportunity I shall append to this present work. I shall add to it also that oration on his Tricennalia which shortly afterwards, having traveled to the city which bears his name, I delivered in the emperors own presence. <a name="fr_3343"></a><a href="#fn_3343"><font size="1">3344</font></a>
  This was the second opportunity afforded me of glorifying the Supreme God in the imperial palace itself: and on this occasion my pious hearer evinced the greatest joy, as he afterwards testified, when he entertained the bishops then present, and loaded them with distinctions of every kind.</p>
