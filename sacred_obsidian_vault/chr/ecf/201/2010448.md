 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III</span>.—<i>How Constantine was stirred in Behalf of the Christians thus in Danger of Persecution.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2.1"></a>He</span>, perceiving the evils of which he had heard to be no longer tolerable, took wise counsel, and tempering the natural clemency of his character with a certain measure of severity, hastened to succor those who were thus grievously oppressed. For he judged that it would rightly be deemed a pious and holy task to secure, by the removal of an individual, the safety of the greater part of the human race. He judged too, that if he listened to the dictates of clemency only, and bestowed his pity on one utterly unworthy of it, this would, on the one hand, confer no real benefit on a man whom nothing would induce to abandon his evil practices, and whose fury against his subjects would only be likely to in<a name="page_501"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 501</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-Page_501"></a>crease; <a name="fr_3162"></a><a href="#fn_3162"><font size="1">3163</font></a>
  while, on the other hand, those who suffered from his oppression would thus be forever deprived of all hope of deliverance.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p4"></a>Influenced by these reflections, the emperor resolved without farther delay to extend a protecting hand to those who had fallen into such an extremity of distress. He accordingly made the usual warlike preparations, and assembled his whole forces, both of horse and foot. But before them all was carried the standard which I have before described, as the symbol of his full confidence in God.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iii-p3"></a> This seems to intend some exoneration of Constantine, explaining why he was what the heathen called “faithless” towards Licinius.</p>
