 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lvii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lvii-p2.1"></a>And</span> truly our worship is no new or recent thing, but one which thou hast ordained for thine own due honor, from the time when, as we believe, this system of the universe was first established. And, although mankind have deeply fallen, and have been seduced by manifold errors, yet hast thou revealed a pure light in the person of thy Son, that the power of evil should not utterly prevail, and hast thus given testimony to all men concerning thyself.</p>
