 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p3"></a> Vespasian reigned from July 1 (if his reign be dated from the time he was proclaimed emperor in Egypt; if from the death of Vitellius, Dec. 20), 69, to June 24, 79 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>
 <a name="fn_698"></a><a href="2010082.htm#fr_698">147:699</a> <a name="iii.viii.xiii-p3.2"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p4"></a> In his <i>Chron.</i> (Armenian) Eusebius gives the length of Linus episcopate as fourteen years, while Jerome gives it as eleven years. Both figures are about equally reliable; see above, chap. 2, note 1.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p5"></a> Of Anencletus, or Cletus, as he is also called, we know nothing more than that he was one of the traditional first three bishops of Rome. Hippolytus makes two bishops, Anencletus and Cletus, out of the one man, and he is followed by the Roman Catholic Church (see above, chap. 2, note 1). According to chap. 15, Anencletus held office twelve years.</p>
 <a name="fn_700"></a><a href="2010082.htm#fr_700">147:701</a> <a name="iii.viii.xiii-p5.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p6"></a> Titus died Dec. 13, <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.xiii-p6.1"></a>a.d.</span> 81. He therefore reigned two years and six months, instead of two years and two months as Eusebius states.</p>
