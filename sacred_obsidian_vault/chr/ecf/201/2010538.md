 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xix-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xix-p1.1"></a>Chapter XIX</span>.—<i>Exhortation to follow the Example of the Greater Part of the World.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xix-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xix-p2.1"></a>Since</span>, therefore, it was needful that this matter should be rectified, so that we might have nothing in common with that nation of parricides who slew their Lord: and since that arrangement is consistent with propriety which is observed by all the churches of the western, southern, and northern parts of the world, and by some of the eastern also: for these reasons all are unanimous on this present occasion in thinking it worthy of adoption. And I myself have undertaken that this decision should meet with the approval of your Sagacities, <a name="fr_3255"></a><a href="#fn_3255"><font size="1">3256</font></a>
  in the hope that your Wisdoms <a name="fr_3256"></a><a href="#fn_3256"><font size="1">3257</font></a>
  will gladly admit that practice which is observed at once in the city of Rome, and in Africa; throughout Italy, and in Egypt, in Spain, the Gauls, Britain, Libya, and the whole of Greece; in the dioceses of Asia and Pontus, and in Cilicia, with entire unity of judgment. And you will consider not only that the number of churches is far greater in the regions I have enumerated than in any other, but also that it is most fitting that all should unite in desiring that which sound reason appears to demand, and in avoiding all participation in the perjured conduct of the Jews. <a name="fr_3257"></a><a href="#fn_3257"><font size="1">3258</font></a>
  In fine, that I may express my meaning in as few words as possible, it has been determined by the common judgment of all, that the most holy feast of Easter should be kept on one and the same day. For on the one hand a discrepancy of opinion on so sacred a question is unbecoming, and on the other it is surely best to act on a decision which is free from strange folly and error.</p>
