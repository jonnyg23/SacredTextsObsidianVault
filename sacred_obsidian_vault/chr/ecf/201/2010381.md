 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p2"></a>The <i>Editions</i> and <i>Translations</i> of this work are substantially identical with those of the Life. See above, under <i>Life</i>. The <i>Authenticity</i> of the work has been doubted, and its composition ascribed to Eusebius or some other Christian writer, but without sufficient reason. It was appended by Eusebius to his Life of Constantine as specimens of the latters style (cf. <i>V.C.</i> 4. 32). As such it shows a man of some learning, though learning taken at second hand, it is thought, from Lactantius and others (cf. Wordsworths Constantine I.). It was composed in Latin, and translated into Greek by the special officials appointed for such work (<i>V.C.</i> 4. 32). It was delivered on Good Friday, but in what year or where is not known. It has been placed before the year 324 (Ceiller, 130), but the mention of events and the character of the work itself suggest a considerably later date.</p>
