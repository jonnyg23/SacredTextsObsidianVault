 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXVIII</span>.—<i>Death of Maxentius on the Bridge of the Tiber.</i> <a name="fr_3125"></a><a href="#fn_3125"><font size="1">3126</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p3.1"></a>And</span> already he was approaching very near Rome itself, when, to save him from the necessity of fighting with all the Romans for the tyrants sake, God himself drew the tyrant, as it were by secret cords, a long way outside the gates. <a name="fr_3126"></a><a href="#fn_3126"><font size="1">3127</font></a>
  And now those miracles recorded in <a name="page_493"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 493</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-Page_493"></a>Holy Writ, which God of old wrought against the ungodly (discredited by most as fables, yet believed by the faithful), did he in every deed confirm to all alike, believers and unbelievers, who were eye-witnesses of the wonders. For as once in the days of Moses and the Hebrew nation, who were worshipers of God, “Pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea and his chosen chariot-captains are drowned in the Red Sea,” <a name="fr_3127"></a><a href="#fn_3127"><font size="1">3128</font></a>
 —so at this time Maxentius, and the soldiers and guards <a name="fr_3128"></a><a href="#fn_3128"><font size="1">3129</font></a>
  with him, “went down into the depths like stone,” <a name="fr_3129"></a><a href="#fn_3129"><font size="1">3130</font></a>
  when, in his flight before the divinely-aided forces of Constantine, he essayed to cross the river which lay in his way, over which, making a strong bridge of boats, he had framed an engine of destruction, really against himself, but in the hope of ensnaring thereby him who was beloved by God. For his God stood by the one to protect him, while the other, godless, <a name="fr_3130"></a><a href="#fn_3130"><font size="1">3131</font></a>
  proved to be the miserable contriver of these secret devices to his own ruin. So that one might well say, “He hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.” <a name="fr_3131"></a><a href="#fn_3131"><font size="1">3132</font></a>
  Thus, in the present instance, under divine direction, the machine erected on the bridge, with the ambuscade concealed therein, giving way unexpectedly before the appointed time, the bridge began to sink, and the boats with the men in them went bodily to the bottom. <a name="fr_3132"></a><a href="#fn_3132"><font size="1">3133</font></a>
  And first the wretch himself, then his armed attendants and guards, even as the sacred oracles had before described, “sank as lead in the mighty waters.” <a name="fr_3133"></a><a href="#fn_3133"><font size="1">3134</font></a>
  So that they who thus obtained victory from God might well, if not in the same words, yet in fact in the same spirit as the people of his great servant Moses, sing and speak as they did concerning the impious tyrant of old: “Let us sing unto the Lord, for he hath been glorified exceedingly: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. He is become my helper and my shield unto salvation.” And again, “Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, marvelous in praises, doing wonders?” <a name="fr_3134"></a><a href="#fn_3134"><font size="1">3135</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p4"></a> The present Ponte Molle is nearly 2½ kilometers (say 1½ miles) from the Porta del Popolo (at the Mons Pincius). The walls at that time were the ones built by Aurelian, and are substantially the same as the present ones. This Pons Milvius was first built 100 years <span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxviii-p4.1"></a>b.c.</span>, and “some part of the first bridge is supposed to remain” (Jenkin, p. 329). Compare Jenkin, art. <i>Bridges,</i> in <i>Enc. Brit.</i> 4 (1878), 329, for cut and description.</p>
