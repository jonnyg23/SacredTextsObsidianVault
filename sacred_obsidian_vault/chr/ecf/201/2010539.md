 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xx-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XX</span>.—<i>Exhortation to obey the Decrees of the Council.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xx-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xx-p2.1"></a>Receive</span>, then, with all willingness this truly Divine injunction, and regard it as in truth the gift of God. For whatever is determined in the holy assemblies of the bishops is to be regarded as indicative of the Divine will. As soon, therefore, as you have communicated these proceedings to all our beloved brethren, you are bound from that time forward to adopt for yourselves, and to enjoin on others the arrangement above mentioned, and the due observance of this most sacred day; that whenever I come into the presence of your love, which I have long desired, I may have it in my power to celebrate the holy feast with you on the same day, and may rejoice with you on all accounts, when I behold the cruel power of Satan removed by Divine aid through the agency of our endeavors, while your faith, and peace, and concord everywhere flourish. God preserve you, beloved brethren!”</p>
