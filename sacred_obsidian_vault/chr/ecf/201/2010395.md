 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>Of the Need for this History, and its Value for Edification.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p2.1"></a>However</span>, hard as it is to speak worthily of this blessed character, and though silence were the safer and less perilous course, nevertheless it is incumbent on me, if I would escape the charge of negligence and sloth, to trace as it were a verbal portraiture, by way of memorial of the pious prince, in imitation of the delineations of human art. For I should be ashamed of myself were I not to employ my best efforts, feeble though they be and of little value, in praise of one who honored God with such surpassing devotion. I think too that my work will be on other grounds both instructive and necessary, since it will contain a description of those royal and noble actions which are pleasing to God, the Sovereign of all. For would it not be disgraceful that the memory of Nero, and other impious and godless tyrants far worse than he, should meet with diligent writers to embellish the relation of their worthless deeds with elegant language, and record them in voluminous histories, and that I should be silent, to whom God himself has vouchsafed such an emperor as all history records not, and has permitted me to come into his presence, and enjoy his acquaintance and society? <a name="fr_3071"></a><a href="#fn_3071"><font size="1">3072</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p4"></a>Wherefore, if it is the duty of any one, it certainly is mine, to make an ample proclamation of his virtues to all in whom the example of noble actions is capable of inspiring the love of God. For some who have written the lives of worthless characters, and the history of actions but little tending to the improvement of morals, from private motives, either love or enmity, and possibly in some cases with no better object than the display of their own learning, have exaggerated unduly their description of actions intrinsically base, by a refinement and elegance of diction. <a name="fr_3072"></a><a href="#fn_3072"><font size="1">3073</font></a>
  And thus they have become to those who by the Divine favor had been kept apart from evil, teachers not of good, but of what should be silenced in oblivion and darkness. But my narrative, however unequal to the greatness of the deeds it has to describe, will yet derive luster even from the bare relation of noble actions. And surely the record of conduct that has been pleasing to God will afford a far from unprofitable, indeed a most instructive study, to persons of well-disposed minds.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.i.x-p5"></a> It looks as if there might perhaps be a direct hit at Lactantius here, as having, through “enmity,” described actions intrinsically base in peculiarly elegant diction; but Lactantius descriptions are hardly more realistic than Eusebius own.</p>
