 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVI.—</span><i>Melito and the Circumstances which he records.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p2.1"></a>In</span> those days also Melito, <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">1276</font></a>
  bishop of the parish in Sardis, and Apolinarius, <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">1277</font></a>
  bishop of Hierapolis, enjoyed great distinction. Each of them on his own part addressed apologies in behalf of the faith to the above-mentioned emperor <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">1278</font></a>
  of the Romans who was reigning at that time.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p10"></a>2. The following works of these writers have come to our knowledge. Of Melito, <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">1279</font></a>
  the two books On the Passover, <a name="fr_1279"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">1280</font></a>
  and <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-Page_204"></a>one On the Conduct of Life and the Prophets, <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">1281</font></a>
  the discourse On the Church, <a name="fr_1281"></a><a href="#fn_1281"><font size="1">1282</font></a>
  and one On the Lords Day, <a name="fr_1282"></a><a href="#fn_1282"><font size="1">1283</font></a>
  still further one On the Faith of Man, <a name="fr_1283"></a><a href="#fn_1283"><font size="1">1284</font></a>
  and one On his Creation, <a name="fr_1284"></a><a href="#fn_1284"><font size="1">1285</font></a>
  another also On the Obedience of Faith, and one On the Senses; <a name="fr_1285"></a><a href="#fn_1285"><font size="1">1286</font></a>
  besides these the work On the Soul and Body, <a name="fr_1286"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">1287</font></a>
  and that On Baptism, <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">1288</font></a>
  and the one On Truth, <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1288"><font size="1">1289</font></a>
  and On the Creation and Generation of Christ; <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1289"><font size="1">1290</font></a>
  his discourse also On Prophecy, <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">1291</font></a>
  and that On Hospitality; <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">1292</font></a>
  still further, The Key, <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">1293</font></a>
  and the books On the Devil and the Apocalypse of John, <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">1294</font></a>
  and the work On the Corporeality of God, <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">1295</font></a>
  and finally the book ad<a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-Page_205"></a>dressed to Antoninus. <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">1296</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p30"></a>3. In the books On the Passover he indicates the time at which he wrote, beginning with these words: “While Servilius Paulus was proconsul of Asia, at the time when Sagaris suffered martyrdom, there arose in Laodicea a great strife concerning the Passover, which fell according to rule in those days; and these were written.” <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">1297</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p32"></a>4. And Clement of Alexandria refers to this work in his own discourse On the Passover, <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">1298</font></a>
  which, he says, he wrote on occasion of Melitos work.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p34"></a>5. But in his book addressed to the emperor he records that the following events happened to us under him: “For, what never before happened, <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">1299</font></a>
  the race of the pious is now suffering persecution, being driven about in Asia by new decrees. For the shameless informers and coveters of the property of others, taking occasion from the decrees, openly carry on robbery night and day, despoiling those who are guilty of no wrong.” And a little further on he says: “If these things are done by thy command, well and good. For a just ruler will never take unjust measures; and we indeed gladly accept the honor of such a death.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p36"></a>6. But this request alone we present to thee, that thou wouldst thyself first examine the authors of such strife, and justly judge whether they be worthy of death and punishment, or of safety and quiet. But if, on the other hand, this counsel and this new decree, which is not fit to be executed even against barbarian enemies, be not from thee, much more do we beseech thee not to leave us exposed to such lawless plundering by the populace.”</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p37"></a>7. Again he adds the following: <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">1300</font></a>
  “For our philosophy formerly flourished among the Barbarians; but having sprung up among the nations under thy rule, during the great reign of thy ancestor Augustus, it became to thine empire especially a blessing of auspicious omen. For from that time the power of the Romans has grown in greatness and splendor. To this power thou hast succeeded, as the desired possessor, <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">1301</font></a>
  and such shalt thou continue with thy son, if thou guardest the philosophy which grew up with the empire and which came into existence with Augustus; that philosophy which thy ancestors also honored along with the other religions.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p40"></a>8. And a most convincing proof that our doctrine flourished for the good of an empire happily begun, is this—that there has no evil happened since Augustus reign, but that, on the contrary, all things have been splendid and glorious, in accordance with the prayers of all.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p41"></a>9. Nero and Domitian, alone, persuaded by certain calumniators, have wished to slander our doctrine, and from them it has come to pass that the falsehood <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">1302</font></a>
  has been <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-Page_206"></a>handed down, in consequence of an unreasonable practice which prevails of bringing slanderous accusations against the Christians. <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">1303</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p44"></a>10. But thy pious fathers corrected their ignorance, having frequently rebuked in writing <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">1304</font></a>
  many who dared to attempt new measures against them. Among them thy grandfather Adrian appears to have written to many others, and also to Fundanus, <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">1305</font></a>
  the proconsul and governor of Asia. And thy father, when thou also wast ruling with him, wrote to the cities, forbidding them to take any new measures against us; among the rest to the Larissæans, to the Thessalonians, to the Athenians, and to all the Greeks. <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">1306</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p48"></a>11. And as for thee,—since thy opinions respecting the Christians <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">1307</font></a>
  are the same as theirs, and indeed much more benevolent and philosophic,—we are the more persuaded that thou wilt do all that we ask of thee.” These words are found in the above-mentioned work.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p50"></a>12. But in the Extracts <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">1308</font></a>
  made by him the same writer gives at the beginning of the introduction a catalogue of the acknowledged books of the Old Testament, which it is necessary to quote at this point. He writes as follows:</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p53"></a>13. “Melito to his brother Onesimus, <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">1309</font></a>
  greeting: Since thou hast often, in thy zeal for the word, expressed a wish to have extracts made from the Law and the Prophets concerning the Saviour and concerning our entire faith, and hast also desired to have an accurate statement of the ancient book, as regards their number and their order, I have endeavored to perform the task, knowing thy zeal for the faith, and thy desire to gain information in regard to the word, and knowing that thou, in thy yearning after God, esteemest these things above all else, struggling to attain eternal salvation.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p55"></a>14. Accordingly when I went East and came to the place where these things were preached and done, I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament, and send them to thee as written below. Their names are as follows: Of Moses, five books: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">1310</font></a>
  Deuteronomy; Jesus Nave, Judges, Ruth; of Kings, four books; of Chronicles, two; the Psalms of David, <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">1311</font></a>
  the Proverbs of Solomon, Wisdom also, <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">1312</font></a>
  Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job; of Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah; of the twelve prophets, one book <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">1313</font></a>
 ; Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras. <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">1314</font></a>
  From which also I have made the extracts, dividing them into six books.” Such are the words of Melito.</p>

 <a name="fn_1275"></a><a href="2010135.htm#fr_1275">203:1276</a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p2.2"></a>
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p3"></a> The first extant notice of Melito, bishop of Sardis, is found in the letter addressed by Polycrates to Bishop Victor of Rome (c. 190–202 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span>) in support of the Quartodeciman practice of the Asia Minor churches. A fragment of this letter is given by Eusebius in Bk. V. chap. 24, and from it we learn that Melito also favored the Quartodeciman practice, that he was a man whose walk and conversation were altogether under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and that he was buried at Sardis. Polycrates in this fragment calls Melito a eunuch. Whether the word is to be understood in its literal sense or is to be taken as meaning simply that Melito lived in “virgin continence” is disputed. In favor of the latter interpretation may be urged the fact that the Greek word and its Latin equivalent were very commonly used by the Fathers in this figurative sense, e.g. by Athenagoras, by Tertullian, by Clement of Alexandria, by Cassianus (whose work on continence bore the title <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p3.2"></a>περὶ ἐγκρατείας, ἢ περὶ εὐνουχίας</span>), by Jerome, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Gregory Nazianzen, &amp;c. (see Smith and Waces <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.,</i> article <i>Melito,</i> and Suicers <i>Thesaurus</i>). On the other hand, such continence cannot have been a rare thing in Asia Minor in the time of Polycrates, and the fact that Melito is called specifically “the eunuch” looks peculiar if nothing more than that is meant by it. The case of Origen, who made himself a eunuch for the sake of preserving his chastity, at once occurs to us in this connection (see Renan, <i>Leglise chret.</i> p. 436, and compare Justin Martyrs <i>Apol.</i> I. 29). The canonical rule that no such eunuch could hold clerical office came later, and hence the fact that Melito was a bishop cannot be urged against the literal interpretation of the word here. Polycrates meaning hardly admits of an absolute decision, but at least it cannot be looked upon as it is by most historians as certain that he uses the word here in its figurative sense.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p4"></a>Polycrates says nothing of the fact that Melito was a writer, but we learn from this chapter (§4), and from Bk. VI. chap. 13, that Clement of Alexandria, in a lost work, mentioned his writings and even wrote a work in reply to one of his (see below, note 23). According to the present chapter he was a very prolific writer, and that he was a man of marked talent is clear from Jeromes words in his <i>de vir. ill.</i> chap. 24 (where he refers to Tertullians lost work, <i>de Ecstasi</i>): <i>Hujus</i> [i.e. <i>Melitonis</i>] <i>elegans et declamatorium ingenium Tertullianus in septem libris, quos scripsit adversus ecclesiam pro Montano, cavillatur, dicens eum a plerisque nostrorum prophetam putari.</i> In spite of the fact that Tertullian satirized Melitos talent, he nevertheless was greatly influenced by his writings and owed much to them (see the points of contact between the two men given by Harnack, p. 250 sqq.). The statement that he was regarded by many as a prophet accords well with Polycrates description of him referred to above. The indications all point to the fact that Melito was decidedly ascetic in his tendencies, and that he had a great deal in common with the spirit which gave rise to Montanism and even made Tertullian a Montanist, and yet at the same time he opposed Montanism, and is therefore spoken of slightingly by Tertullian. His position, so similar to that of the Montanists, was not in favor with the orthodox theologians of the third century, and this helps to explain why, although he was such a prolific and talented writer, and although he remained orthodox, he nevertheless passed almost entirely out of the memory of the Church of the third and following centuries. To this is to be added the fact that Melito was a chiliast; and the teachings of the Montanists brought such disrepute upon chiliasm that the Fathers of the third and following centuries did not show much fondness for those who held or had held these views. Very few notices of Melitos works are found among the Fathers, and none of those works is to-day extant. Eusebius is the first to give us an idea of the number and variety of his writings, and he does little more than mention the titles, a fact to be explained only by his lack of sympathy with Melitos views.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p5"></a>The time at which Melito lived is indicated with sufficient exactness by the fact that he wrote his <i>Apology</i> during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but after the death of his brother Lucius, i.e. after 169 (see below, note 21); and that when Polycrates wrote his epistle to Victor of Rome, he had been dead already some years. It is possible (as held by Piper, Otto, and others) that his <i>Apology</i> was his last work, for Eusebius mentions it last in his list. At the same time, it is quite as possible that Eusebius enumerates Melitos works simply in the order in which he found them arranged in the library of Cæsarea, where he had perhaps seen them. Of the dates of his episcopacy, and of his predecessors and successors in the see of Sardis, we know nothing.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6"></a>In addition to the works mentioned in this chapter by Eusebius, who does not pretend to give a full list, we find in Anastasius Sinaitas <i>Hodegos seu dux viæ c. aceph.</i> fragments from two other works entitled <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.1"></a>εἰς τὸ π€θος</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.2"></a>περὶ σαρκώσεως χριστοῦ</span> (the latter directed against Marcion), which cannot be identified with any mentioned by Eusebius (see Harnack, I. 1, p. 254). The <i>Codex Nitriacus Musei Britannici</i> 12,156 contains four fragments ascribed to Melito, of which the first belongs undoubtedly to his genuine work <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.3"></a>περὶ ψυχῆς καὶ σώματος</span>, which is mentioned in this chapter by Eusebius. The second purports to be taken from a work, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.4"></a>περὶ σταυροῦ</span>, of which we hear nowhere else, and which may or may not have been by Melito. The third fragment bears the title <i>Melitonis episcopi de fide,</i> and might be looked upon as an extract from the work <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.5"></a>περὶ πίστεως</span>, mentioned by Eusebius (as Otto regards it); but the same fragment is four times ascribed to Irenæus by other early authorities, and an analysis of these authorities shows that the tradition in favor of Irenæus is stronger than that in favor of Melito, and so Harnack mentions a work, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.6"></a>περὶ πίστεως</span>, which is ascribed by Maximus Confessor to Irenæus, and from which the quotation may have been taken (see Harnack, <i>ibid.</i> p. 266 ff.). The fourth fragment was taken in all probability from Melitos work, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.7"></a>περὶ π€θους</span>, mentioned by Anastasius. An Apology in Syriac, bearing the name of Melito, is extant in another of the Nitrian <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.8"></a>mss.</span> in the British Museum (No. 14,658), and has been published with an English translation by Cureton, in his <i>Spic. Syr.</i> (p. 41–51). It has been proved, however, that this Apology (which we have entire) was not written by Melito, but probably by an inhabitant of Syria, in the latter part of the second, or early part of the third century,—whether originally in the Greek or Syriac language is uncertain (see Harnack, p. 261 ff., and Smith and Wace, Vol. III. p. 895). In addition to the genuine writings, there must be mentioned also some spurious works which are still extant. Two Latin works of the early Middle Ages, entitled <i>de transitu Mariæ</i> and <i>de passione S. Joannis Evangelistæ,</i> and also a <i>Catena</i> of the latter Middle Ages on the Apocalypse, and a <i>Clavis Scripturæ</i> of the Carlovingian period (see below, note 18), bear in some <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p6.9"></a>mss.</span> the name of Melito. This fact shows that Melitos name was not entirely forgotten in the Occidental Church of the Middle Ages, though little exact knowledge of him seems to have existed.</p>  
 <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p7"></a>On Melito and his writings, see Pipers article in the <i>Theol. Studien und Kritiken,</i> 1838, p. 54–154; Salmons article in Smith and Wace, and especially Harnacks <i>Texte und Unters.</i> I. 1, p. 240–278. The extant fragments of Melitos writings are given in Rouths <i>Rel. Sac.</i> I. 111–153, and in Ottos <i>Corp. Apol.</i> IX. 374–478, and an English translation in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Vol. VIII. p. 750–762.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p11"></a> The following list of Melitos works is at many points very uncertain, owing to the various readings of the <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p11.1"></a>mss.</span> and versions. We have as authorities for the text, the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p11.2"></a>mss.</span> of Eusebius, the <i>History</i> of Nicephorus, the translation of Rufinus, chap. 24 of Jeromes <i>de vir. ill.,</i> and the Syriac version of this passage of Eusebius <i>History,</i> which has been printed by Cureton, in his <i>Spic. Syr.</i> p. 56 ff.</p>
 <a name="fn_1279"></a><a href="2010135.htm#fr_1279">203:1280</a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p11.3"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p12"></a> The quotation from this work given by Eusebius in §7, perhaps enables us to fix approximately the date at which it was written. Rufinus reads Sergius Paulus, instead of Servilius Paulus, which is found in all the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p12.1"></a>mss.</span> Sergius Paulus is known to have had his second consulship in 168, and it is inferred by Waddington that he was proconsul about 164 to 166 (see <i>Fastes des provinces Asiatiques,</i> chap. 2, §148). No Servilius Paulus is known in connection with the province of Asia, and hence it seems probable that Rufinus is correct; and if so, the work on the Passover was written early in the sixties. The fragment which Eusebius gives in this chapter is the only part of his work that is extant. It was undoubtedly in favor of the Quartodeciman practice, for Polycrates, who was a decided Quartodeciman, cites Melito in support of his position.</p>
 <a name="fn_1280"></a><a href="2010135.htm#fr_1280">204:1281</a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p12.2"></a>
 <p><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13"></a> The exact reading at this point is disputed. I read, with a number of <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.1"></a>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.2"></a>τὸ περὶ πολιτείας καὶ προφητῶν</span>, making but one work, <i>On the Conduct of Life and the Prophets.</i> Many <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.3"></a>mss.</span> followed by Valesius, Heinichen, and Burton, read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.4"></a>τὰ</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.5"></a>τό</span>, thus making either two works (one <i>On the Conduct of Life,</i> and the other <i>On the Prophets),</i> or one work containing more than one book. Rufinus translates <i>de optima conversatione liber unus, sed et de prophetis,</i> and the Syriac repeats the preposition, as if it read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.6"></a>καὶ περὶ πολιτείας καὶ περὶ προφητῶν</span>. It is not quite certain whether Rufinus and the Syriac thought of two works in translating thus, or of only one. Jerome translates, <i>de vita prophetarum librum unum,</i> and in accordance with this translation Otto proposes to read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.7"></a>τῶν προφητῶν</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.8"></a>καὶ προφητῶν</span>. But this is supported by no <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p13.9"></a>ms.</span> authority, and cannot be accepted.</p>  
 <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p14"></a>No fragments of this work are extant.</p>

If this supposition be correct, Jerome omits all reference to this work <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p17.5"></a>περὶ πίστεως ἀνθρώπου</span>. The text of Jerome is unfortunately very corrupt at this point. In the present passage <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p17.6"></a>πίστεως</span> is better supported by tradition than <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p17.7"></a>φύσεως</span>, and at the same time is the more difficult reading, and hence I have adopted it as more probably representing the original.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20"></a> A serious difficulty arises in connection with this title from the fact that most of the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.1"></a>mss.</span> read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.2"></a>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.3"></a>περὶ ψυχῆς καὶ σώματος ἢ νοός</span>, while the Syriac, Rufinus, and Jerome omit the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.4"></a>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.5"></a>νοός</span> entirely. Nicephorus and two of the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.6"></a>mss.</span> meanwhile read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.7"></a>ἦ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.8"></a>ν ἐν οἷς</span>, which is evidently simply a corruption of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.9"></a>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.10"></a>νοός</span>, so that the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.11"></a>mss.</span> are unanimous for this reading. Otto, Crusè, and Salmon read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.12"></a>καὶ νοός</span>, but there is no authority for <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.13"></a>καὶ</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.14"></a>ἤ</span>, and the change cannot be admitted. The explanation which Otto gives (p. 376) of the change of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.15"></a>ἤ</span> to <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.16"></a>καὶ</span> will not hold, as Harnack shows on p. 247, note 346. It seems to me certain that the words <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.17"></a>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.18"></a>νοός</span> did not stand in the original, but that the word <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.19"></a>νοός</span>, (either alone or preceded by <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.20"></a>ἤ</span> or <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.21"></a>καί</span>) was written upon the margin by some scribe perhaps as an alternative to <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.22"></a>ψυχῆς</span>, perhaps as an addition in the interest of trichotomy, and was later inserted in the text after <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.23"></a>ψυχῆς</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.24"></a>σώματος</span>, under the impression that it was an alternative title of the book. My reasons for this opinion are the agreement of the versions in the omission of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.25"></a>νοός</span>, the impossibility of explaining the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.26"></a>ἢ</span> before <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.27"></a>νοός</span> in the original text, the fact that in the Greek <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.28"></a>mss.</span>, in Rufinus, and in the Syriac, the words <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.29"></a>καὶ περὶ ψυχῆς καὶ σώματος</span> are repeated further down in the list,—a repetition which Harnack thinks was made inadvertently by Eusebius himself, and which in omitting <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.30"></a>νοός</span> confirms the omission of it in the present case,—and finally, a fact which seems to me decisive, but which has apparently hitherto escaped notice, that the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.31"></a>νοός</span>, follows instead of precedes the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p20.32"></a>σώματος</span>, and thus breaks the logical order, which would certainly have been preserved in the title of a book.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p22"></a> Apolinarius (according to chap. 27) also wrote a work <i>On Truth,</i> and the place which it holds in that list, between an apologetical work addressed to the Greeks and one addressed to the Jews, makes it probable that it too bore an apologetic character, being perhaps devoted to showing that Christianity is pre-eminently the truth. Melitos work on the same subject very likely bore a similar character, as suggested by Salmon.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23"></a> Six <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.1"></a>mss.</span>, with Nicephorus, read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.2"></a>κτίσεως</span>, “creation,” but five <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.3"></a>mss.</span>, with the Syriac and Rufinus, and possibly Jerome, read <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.4"></a>πίστεως</span>. The latter reading therefore has the strongest external testimony in its favor, but must be rejected (with Stroth, Otto, Heinichen, Harnack, etc.) as evidently a dogmatic correction of the fourth century, when there was an objection to the use of the word <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.5"></a>κτίσις</span> in connection with Christ. Rufinus divides the one work <i>On the Creation and Generation of Christ</i> into two,—<i>On Faith</i> and <i>On the Generation of Christ, and his prophecy,</i> connecting the second with the next-mentioned work. Jerome omits the first clause entirely at this point, and translates simply <i>de generatione Christi librum unum.</i> The <i>de fide,</i> however, which he inserts earlier in his list, where there is no corresponding word in the Greek, may be the title which he omits here (see above, note 9), displaced, as the title <i>de sensibus</i> is also displaced. If this be true, he becomes with Rufinus and the Syriac a witness to the reading <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.6"></a>πίστεως</span> instead of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p23.7"></a>κτίσεως</span>, and like Rufinus divides the one work of Eusebius into two.</p>

All three therefore connect the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.4"></a>αὐτοῦ</span> with the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.5"></a>προφητείας</span> instead of with the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.6"></a>λόγος</span>, which of course is much more natural, since the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.7"></a>αὐτοῦ</span> with the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.8"></a>λόγος</span> seems quite unnecessary at this point. The translation of the Syriac, Rufinus, and Jerome, however, would require <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.9"></a>περὶ προφητείας αὐτοῦ</span> or <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.10"></a>περὶ τῆς αὐτοῦ προφητείας</span>, and there is no sign that the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.11"></a>αὐτοῦ</span> originally stood in such connection with the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p24.12"></a>προφητείας</span>.

The nature of this work we have no means of determining. It is possible that it was a key to the interpretation of the Scriptures, designed to guide the reader in the study especially of the figures of the prophecies (cf. Otto, p. 401) and of the Apocalypse. Piper is right, however, in saying that it cannot have been intended to supply the allegorical meaning of Scripture words, like the extant Latin <i>Clavis</i> of Pseudo-Melito, mentioned just below; for Melito, who like Tertullian taught the corporeality of God, must have been very literal—not allegorical—in his interpretation of Scripture. A Latin work bearing the title <i>Melitonis Clavis Sanctæ Scripturæ</i> was mentioned by Labbe in 1653 as contained in the library of Clermont College, and after years of search was recovered and published by Pitra in 1855 in his <i>Spicileg. Solesm.</i> Vols. II. and III. He regarded the work as a translation, though with interpolations, of the genuine <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p26.3"></a>κλείς</span> of Melito, but this hypothesis has been completely disproved (see the article by Steitz in the <i>Studien und Kritiken,</i> 1857, p. 184 sqq.), and the work has been shown to be nothing more than a mediæval dictionary of allegorical interpolations of Scripture, compiled from the Latin Fathers. There is, therefore, no trace extant of Melitos <i>Key.</i></p>

III.</i> (ed. Lommatzsch, XI. p. 411), says that Melito treated Absalom as a type of the devil warring against the kingdom of Christ. It has been conjectured that the reference may be to this work of Melitos, and that reference is an argument for the supposition that Melito treated the devil and the Apocalypse in one work (cf. Harnack, p. 248, and Smith and Wace, p. 898).</p>
 <a name="fn_1294"></a><a href="2010135.htm#fr_1294">204:1295</a> <a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p27.3"></a>

Jerome does not translate this phrase, but simply gives the Greek. Rufinus renders <i>de deo corpore induto,</i> thus understanding it to refer to the incarnation of God, and the Syriac agrees with this rendering. But as Harnack rightly remarks, we should expect, if this were the authors meaning, the words <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p28.3"></a>περὶ ἐνσωματώσεως θεοῦ</span>, or rather <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p28.4"></a>λόγου</span>. Moreover, Origen (<i>Selecta in Gen.</i> I. 26; Lommatzsch, VIII. p. 49) enumerates Melito among those who taught the corporeality of God, and says that he had written a work <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p28.5"></a>περὶ τοῦ ἐνσώματον εἶναι τὸν θεόν</span>. It is possible, of course, that he may not have seen Melitos work, and that he may have misunderstood its title and have mistaken a work on the incarnation for one on the corporeality of God; but this is not at all likely. Either he had read the book, and knew it to be upon the subject he states, or else he knew from other sources that Melito believed in the corporeality of God, and hence had no doubt that this work was upon that subject. There is no reason in any case for doubting the accuracy of Origens statement, and for hesitating to conclude that the work mentioned by Eusebius was upon the corporeality of God. The close relationship existing between Melito and Tertullian has already been referred to, and this fact furnishes confirmation for the belief that Melito held God to be corporeal, for we know Tertullians views on that subject. Gennadius (<i>de eccles. dogmat.</i> chap. 4) classes Melito and Tertullian together, as both teaching a corporeality in the Godhead. What was the source of his statement, and how much dependence is to be put upon it, we cannot say, but it is at least a corroboration of the conclusion already reached. We conclude then that Rufinus and the Syriac were mistaken in their rendering, and that this work discussed the corporeality, not the incarnation, of God.</p>

The <i>Apology</i> is mentioned also in chap. 13, above, and at the beginning of this chapter. Jerome puts it first in his list, with the words: <i>Melito Asianus, Sardensis episcopus, librum imperatori M. Antonini Vero, qui Frontonis oratoris discipulus fuit, pro christiano dogmate dedit.</i> This Apology is no longer extant, and we have only the fragments which Eusebius gives in this chapter. As remarked in note 1, above, the extant Syriac <i>Apology</i> is not a work of Melitos. The <i>Apology</i> is mentioned in Jeromes version of the <i>Chron.,</i> and is assigned to the tenth year of Marcus Aurelius, 120 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p29.4"></a>a.d.</span> The notice is omitted in the Armenian, which, however, assigns to the eleventh year of Marcus Aurelius the <i>Apology</i> of Apolinarius, which is connected with that of Melito in the <i>Ch. Hist.</i> Moreover, a notice of the <i>Apology</i> is given by Syncellus in connection with the tenth year of Marcus Aurelius, and also by the <i>Chron. Pasch.;</i> so that it is not improbable that Eusebius himself mentioned it in his <i>Chron.,</i> and that its omission in the Armenian is a mistake (as Harnack thinks likely). But though the notice may thus have been made by Eusebius himself, we are nevertheless not at liberty to accept the date given as conclusive. We learn from the quotations given by Eusebius that the work was addressed to the emperor after the death of Lucius Verus, i.e. after the year 169. Whether before or after the association of Commodus with his father in the imperial power, which took place in 176, is uncertain; but I am inclined to think that the words quoted in §7, below, point to a prospective rather than to a present association of Commodus in the empire, and that therefore the work was written between 169 and 176. It must be admitted, however, that we can say with certainty only that the work was written between 169 and 180. Some would put the work at the beginning of those persecutions which raged in 177, and there is much to be said for this. But the dates of the local and minor persecutions, which were so frequent during this period, are so uncertain that little can be based upon the fact that we know of persecutions in certain parts of the empire in 177. Piper, Otto, and others conclude from the fact that the <i>Apology</i> is mentioned last by Eusebius that it was Melitos latest work; but that, though not at all unlikely, does not necessarily follow (see above, note 1).</p>

This is all we know of him. The date of his martyrdom, and of the composition of the work <i>On the Passover,</i> depends upon the date of the proconsulship of Servilius (or Sergius) Paulus (see above, note 5).

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p38"></a> The resemblance between this extract from Melitos <i>Apology</i> and the fifth chapter of Tertullians <i>Apology</i> is close enough to be striking, and too close to be accidental. Tertullians chapter is quite different from this, so far as its arrangement and language are concerned, but the same thought underlies both: That the emperors in general have protected Christianity; only Nero and Domitian, the most wicked of them, have persecuted it; and that Christianity has been a blessing to the reigns of all the better emperors. We cannot doubt that Tertullian was acquainted with Melitos <i>Apology,</i> as well as with others of his works.</p>

The nature of the work is clear from the words of Melito himself. It was a collection of testimonies to Christ and to Christianity, drawn from the Old Testament law and prophets. It must, therefore, have resembled closely such works as Cyprians <i>Testimonia,</i> and the <i>Testimonia</i> of Pseudo-Gregory, and other anti-Jewish works, in which the appeal was made to the Old Testament—the common ground accepted by both parties—for proof of the truth of Christianity. Although the <i>Eclogæ</i> of Melito were not anti-Jewish in their design, their character leads us to classify them with the general class of anti-Jewish works whose distinguishing mark is the use of Old Testament prophecy in defense of Christianity (cf. the writers article on <i>Christian Polemics against the Jews,</i> in the <i>Pres. Review,</i> July, 1888, and also the writers <i>Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew,</i> entitled <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p51.6"></a>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxvi-p51.7"></a>Αντιβολὴ Παπισκου καὶ φίλωνος</span>, New York, 1889).</p>
