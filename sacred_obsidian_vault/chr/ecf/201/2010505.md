 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-p1.1"></a>Chapter LX</span>.—<i>An Admonition at the Close of the Edict, that No One should trouble his Neighbor.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-p2.1"></a>Once</span> more, let none use that to the detriment of another which he may himself have received on conviction of its truth; but let every one, if it be possible, apply what he has understood and known to the benefit of his neighbor; if otherwise, let him relinquish the attempt. For it is one thing voluntarily to undertake the conflict for immortality, another to compel others to do so from the fear of punishment.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-p3"></a>“These are our words; and we have enlarged on these topics more than our ordinary clemency would have dictated, because we were unwilling to dissemble or be false to the true faith; and the more so, since we understand there are some who say that the rites of the heathen temples, and the power of darkness, have been entirely removed. We should indeed have earnestly <a name="page_515"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 515</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.lx-Page_515"></a>recommended such removal to all men, were it not that the rebellious spirit of those wicked errors still continues obstinately fixed in the minds of some, so as to discourage the hope of any general restoration of mankind to the ways of truth.” <a name="fr_3205"></a><a href="#fn_3205"><font size="1">3206</font></a>
