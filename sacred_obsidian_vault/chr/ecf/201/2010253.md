 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p1.1"></a>Chapter I.—</span><i>The Events which preceded the Persecution in our Times.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p2.1"></a>It</span> is beyond our ability to describe in a suitable manner the extent and nature of the glory and freedom with which the word of piety toward the God of the universe, proclaimed to the world through Christ, was honored among all men, both Greeks and barbarians, before the persecution in our day.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p3"></a>2. The favor shown our people by the rulers might be adduced as evidence; as they committed to them the government of provinces, <a name="fr_2492"></a><a href="#fn_2492"><font size="1">2493</font></a>
  and on account of the great friendship which they entertained toward their doctrine, released them from anxiety in regard to sacrificing.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p5"></a>3. Why need I speak of those in the royal palaces, and of the rulers over all, who allowed the members of their households, wives <a name="fr_2493"></a><a href="#fn_2493"><font size="1">2494</font></a>
  and children and servants, to speak openly before them for the Divine word and life, and suffered them almost to boast of the freedom of their faith?</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p7"></a>4. Indeed they esteemed them highly, and preferred them to their fellow-servants. Such an one was that Dorotheus, <a name="fr_2494"></a><a href="#fn_2494"><font size="1">2495</font></a>
  the most devoted and faithful to them of all, and on this account especially honored by them among those who held the most honorable offices and governments. With him was the celebrated Gorgonius, <a name="fr_2495"></a><a href="#fn_2495"><font size="1">2496</font></a>
  and as many as had been esteemed worthy of the same distinction on account of the word of God.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p10"></a>5. And one could see the rulers in every church accorded the greatest favor <a name="fr_2496"></a><a href="#fn_2496"><font size="1">2497</font></a>
  by all officers and governors. But how can any one describe those vast assemblies, and the multitude that crowded together in every city, and the famous gatherings in the houses of prayer; on whose account not being satisfied with the ancient buildings they erected from the foundation large churches in all the cities?</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p12"></a>6. No envy hindered the progress of these affairs which advanced gradually, and grew and increased day by day. Nor could any evil demon slander them or hinder them through human counsels, so long as the divine and heavenly hand watched over and guarded his own people as worthy.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p13"></a>7. But when on account of the abundant freedom, we fell into laxity and sloth, and envied and reviled each other, and were almost, as it were, taking up arms against one another, rulers assailing rulers with words like spears, and people forming parties against people, and monstrous hypocrisy and dissimulation rising to the greatest height of wickedness, the divine judgment with forbearance, as is its pleasure, while the multitudes yet continued to assemble, gently and moderately harassed the episcopacy.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p14"></a>8. This persecution began with the brethren in the army. But as if without sensibility, we were not eager to make the Deity favorable and propitious; and some, like atheists, thought that our affairs were unheeded and ungoverned; and thus we added one wickedness to another. <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a> <a name="iii.xiii.ii-Page_324"></a>And those esteemed our shepherds, casting aside the bond of piety, were excited to conflicts with one another, and did nothing else than heap up strifes and threats and jealousy and enmity and hatred toward each other, like tyrants eagerly endeavoring to assert their power. Then, truly, according to the word of Jeremiah, “The Lord in his wrath darkened the daughter of Zion, and cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth, and remembered not his foot-stool in the day of his anger. The Lord also overwhelmed all the beautiful things of Israel, and threw down all his strongholds.” <a name="fr_2497"></a><a href="#fn_2497"><font size="1">2498</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p16"></a>9. And according to what was foretold in the Psalms: “He has made void the covenant of his servant, and profaned his sanctuary to the earth,—in the destruction of the churches,—and has thrown down all his strongholds, and has made his fortresses cowardice. All that pass by have plundered the multitude of the people; and he has become besides a reproach to his neighbors. For he has exalted the right hand of his enemies, and has turned back the help of his sword, and has not taken his part in the war. But he has deprived him of purification, and has cast his throne to the ground. He has shortened the days of his time, and besides all, has poured out shame upon him.” <a name="fr_2498"></a><a href="#fn_2498"><font size="1">2499</font></a>

Prisca, the wife, and Valeria, the daughter, of Diocletian, and the wife of Galerius, were very friendly to the Christians, and indeed there can be little doubt that they were themselves Christians, or at least catechumens, though they kept the fact secret and sacrificed to the gods (Lactantius, <i>De mort. pers.</i> 15) when all of Diocletians household were required to do so, after the second conflagration in the palace (see Masons <i>Persecution of Diocletian,</i> p. 40, 121 sq.). It is probable in the present case that Eusebius is thinking not simply of the wives of Diocletian and Galerius, but also of all the women and children connected in any way with the imperial household.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p8"></a> Of this Dorotheus we know only what is told us here and in chap. 6, below, where it is reported that he was put to death by strangling. It might be thought at first sight that he is to be identified with the Dorotheus mentioned above in Bk. VII. chap. 32, for both lived at the same time, and the fact that the Dorotheus mentioned there was a eunuch would fit him for a prominent station in the emperors household. At the same time he is said by Eusebius to have been made superintendent of the purple dye house at Tyre, and nothing is said either as to his connection with the household of the emperor or as to his martyrdom; nor is the Dorotheus mentioned in this chapter said to have been a presbyter. In fact, inasmuch as Eusebius gives no hint of the identity of the two men, we must conclude that they were different persons in spite of the similarity of their circumstances.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xiii.ii-p9"></a> Of Gorgonius, who is mentioned also in chap. 6, we know only that he was one of the imperial household, and that he was strangled, in company with Dorotheus and others, in consequence of the fires in the Nicomedian palace. See chap. 6, note 3.</p>
