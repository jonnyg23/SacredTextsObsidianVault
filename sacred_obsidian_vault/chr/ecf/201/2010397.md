 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.i.xii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XII</span>.—<i>That like Moses, he was reared in the Palaces of Kings.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xii-p2.1"></a>Ancient</span> history relates that a cruel race of tyrants oppressed the Hebrew nation; and that God, who graciously regarded them in their affliction, provided that the prophet Moses, who was then an infant, should be brought up in the very palaces and bosoms of the oppressors, and instructed in all the wisdom they possessed. And when in the course of time he had arrived at manhood, and the time was come for Divine justice to avenge the wrongs of the afflicted people, then the prophet of God, in obedience to the will of a more powerful Lord, forsook the royal household, and, estranging himself in word and deed from the tyrants by whom he had been brought up, openly acknowledging his true brethren and kinsfolk. Then God, exalting him to be the leader of the whole nation, delivered the Hebrews from the bondage of their enemies, and inflicted Divine vengeance through his means on the tyrant race. This ancient story, though rejected by most as fabulous, has reached the ears of all. But now the same God has given to us to be eye-witnesses of miracles more wonderful than fables, and, from their recent appearance, more authentic than any report. For the tyrants of our day have ventured to war against the Supreme God, and have sorely afflicted His Church. <a name="fr_3074"></a><a href="#fn_3074"><font size="1">3075</font></a>
  And in the midst of these, Constantine, who was shortly to become their destroyer, but at that time of tender age, and blooming with the down of early youth, dwelt, as that other servant of God had done, in the very home of the tyrants, <a name="fr_3075"></a><a href="#fn_3075"><font size="1">3076</font></a>
  but young as he was did not share the manner of life of the ungodly: for from that early period his noble nature, under the leading of the Divine Spirit, inclined him to piety and a life acceptable to God. A desire, moreover, to emulate the example of his father had its influence in stimulating the son to a virtuous course of conduct. His father was Constantius <a name="fr_3076"></a><a href="#fn_3076"><font size="1">3077</font></a>
  (and we ought to revive his memory at this time), the most illustrious emperor of our age; of whose life it is necessary briefly to relate a few particulars, which tell to the honor of his son.</p>
