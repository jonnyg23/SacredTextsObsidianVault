 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—<i>The Treasury must restore Lands, Gardens, and Houses to the Churches.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p2.1"></a>Nor</span> shall the treasury itself, should it have any of the things we have spoken of, be permitted to keep them; but, without venturing as it were to raise its voice against the holy churches, it shall justly relinquish in their favor what it has for a time unjustly retained. We ordain, therefore, that all things whatsoever which shall appear righteously to belong to the churches, whether the property consist of houses or fields and gardens, or whatever the nature of it may be, shall be restored in their full value and integrity, and with undiminished right of possession.</p>
