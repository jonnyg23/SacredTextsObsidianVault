 </p><p class="c49"><a name="iii.x.v-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.x.v-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV.—</span><i>Irenæus commended by the Witnesses in a Letter.</i></p>  
 <p><a name="iii.x.v-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.x.v-p2.1"></a>The</span> same witnesses also recommended Irenæus, <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1411"><font size="1">1412</font></a>
  who was already at that time a presbyter of the parish of Lyons, to the above-mentioned bishop of Rome, saying many favorable things in regard to him, as the following extract shows:</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.x.v-p4"></a>2. “We pray, father Eleutherus, that you may rejoice in God in all things and always. We have requested our brother and comrade Irenæus to carry this letter to you, and we ask you to hold him in esteem, as zealous for the covenant of Christ. For if we thought that office could confer righteousness upon any one, we should commend him among the first as a presbyter of the church, which is his position.”</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.x.v-p5"></a>3. Why should we transcribe the catalogue of the witnesses given in the letter already mentioned, of whom some were beheaded, others cast to the wild beasts, and others fell asleep in prison, or give the number of confessors <a name="fr_1412"></a><a href="#fn_1412"><font size="1">1413</font></a>
  still surviving at that time? For whoever desires can readily find the full account by consulting the letter itself, which, as I have said, is recorded in our Collection of Martyrdoms. <a name="fr_1413"></a><a href="#fn_1413"><font size="1">1414</font></a>
  Such were the events which happened under Antoninus. <a name="fr_1414"></a><a href="#fn_1414"><font size="1">1415</font></a>
