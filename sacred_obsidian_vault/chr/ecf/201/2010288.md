 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xv.iii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xv.iii-p2.1"></a>After</span> this man had carried on all kinds of war against us and had caused our people to be diligently hunted up in their retreats, as if they were unholy thieves, and had devised every sort of slander and accusation against us, and become the cause of death to vast numbers, he finally erected a statue of Jupiter Philius <a name="fr_2724"></a><a href="#fn_2724"><font size="1">2725</font></a>
  with certain juggleries and magic rites. And after inventing unholy forms of initiation and ill-omened mysteries in connection with it, and abominable means of purification, <a name="fr_2725"></a><a href="#fn_2725"><font size="1">2726</font></a>
  he exhibited his jugglery, by oracles which he pretended to utter, even to the emperor; and through a flattery which was pleasing to the ruler he aroused the demon against the Christians and said that the god had given command to expel the Christians as his enemies beyond the confines of the city and the neighboring districts.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xv.iii-p3"></a> Jupiter Philius, the god of friendship or good-will, was widely honored in the East. He seems to have been the tutelary divinity of Antioch, and, according to Valesius, a temple of his at Antioch is mentioned by the emperor Julian and by Libanius.</p>
