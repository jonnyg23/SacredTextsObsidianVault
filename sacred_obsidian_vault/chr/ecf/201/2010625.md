 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—<i>That a Place in Phœnicia also was made a City, and in Other Cities Idolatry was abolished, and Churches built.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxxix-p2.1"></a>A similar</span> change was effected in several other cities; for instance, in that town of Phœnicia which received its name from that of the emperor, and the inhabitants of which committed their innumerable idols to the flames, and adopted in their stead the principles of the saving faith. Numbers, too, in the other provinces, both in the cities and the country, became willing inquirers after the saving knowledge of God; destroyed as worthless things the images of every kind which they had heretofore held most sacred; voluntarily demolished the lofty temples and shrines which contained them; and, renouncing their former sentiments, or rather errors, commenced and completed entirely new churches. But since it is not so much my province to give a circumstantial detail of the actions of this pious prince, as it is theirs who have been privileged to enjoy his society at all times, I shall content myself with briefly recording such facts as have come to my own personal knowledge, before I proceed to notice the last days of his life.</p>
