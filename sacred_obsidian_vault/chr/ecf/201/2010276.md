 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xiv.vi-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xiv.vi-p2.1"></a>About</span> the same time, in the city of Tyre, a youth named Ulpianus, <a name="fr_2649"></a><a href="#fn_2649"><font size="1">2650</font></a>
  after dreadful tortures and most severe scourgings, was enclosed in a raw oxhide, with a dog and with one of those poisonous reptiles, an asp, and cast into the sea. Wherefore I think that we may properly mention him in connection with the martyrdom of Apphianus.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.vi-p4"></a>2. Shortly afterwards, Ædesius, <a name="fr_2650"></a><a href="#fn_2650"><font size="1">2651</font></a>
  a brother of Apphianus, not only in God, but also in the flesh, being a son of the same earthly father, endured sufferings like his, after very many confessions and protracted tortures in bonds, and after he had been sentenced by the governor to the mines in Palestine. He conducted himself through them all in a truly philosophic manner; for he was more highly educated than his brother, and had prosecuted philosophic studies.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.vi-p6"></a>3. Finally in the city of Alexandria, when he beheld the judge, who was trying the Christians, offending beyond all bounds, now insulting holy men in various ways, and again consigning women of greatest modesty and even religious virgins to procurers for shameful treatment, he acted like his brother. For as these things seemed insufferable, he went forward with bold resolve, and with his words and deeds overwhelmed the judge with shame and disgrace. After suffering in consequence many forms of torture, he endured a death similar to his brothers, being cast into the sea. But these things, as I have said, happened to him in this way a little later.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xiv.vi-p3"></a> The martyrdom of Ulpian is omitted in the Syriac version. It was apparently a later addition, made when the abridgment of the longer version was produced; and this perhaps accounts for the brevity of the notice and the words of explanation with which the mention of him is concluded.</p>
