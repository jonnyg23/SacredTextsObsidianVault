 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xvii-p2.1"></a>The</span> father of Constantine, then, is said to have possessed such a character as we have briefly described. And what kind of death was vouchsafed to him in consequence of such devotion to God, and how far he whom he honored made his lot to differ from that of his colleagues in the empire, may be known to any one who will give his attention to the circumstances of the case.

 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.xvii-p4"></a>Accordingly, during the whole course of his quiet and peaceful reign, he dedicated his entire household, his children, his wife, and domestic attendants, to the One Supreme God: so that the company assembled within the walls of his palace differed in no respect from a church of God; wherein were also to be found his ministers, who offered continual supplications on behalf of their prince, and this at a time when, with most, <a name="fr_3084"></a><a href="#fn_3084"><font size="1">3085</font></a>
  it was not allowable to have any dealings with the worshipers of God, even so far as to exchange a word with them.</p>
