 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter LVIII</span>.—<i>He glorifies him again for his Government of the Universe.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p2.1"></a>The</span> truth of this is assured to us by thy works. It is thy power which removes our guilt, and makes us faithful. The sun and the moon have their settled course. The stars move in no uncertain orbits round this terrestrial globe. The revolution of the seasons recurs according to unerring laws. The solid fabric of the earth was established by thy word: the winds receive their impulse at appointed times; and the course of the waters continues with ceaseless flow, <a name="fr_3203"></a><a href="#fn_3203"><font size="1">3204</font></a>
  the ocean is circumscribed by an immovable barrier, and whatever is comprehended within the compass of earth and sea, is all contrived for wondrous and important ends.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii.lviii-p4"></a>“Were it not so, were not all regulated by the determination of thy will, so great a diversity, so manifold a division of power, would unquestionably have brought ruin on the whole race and its affairs. For those agencies which have maintained a mutual strife <a name="fr_3204"></a><a href="#fn_3204"><font size="1">3205</font></a>
  would thus have carried to a more deadly length that hostility against the human race which they even now exercise, though unseen by mortal eyes.</p>
