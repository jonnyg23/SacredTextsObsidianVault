 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXI</span>.—<i>Release likewise granted to Exiles in the Islands.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p2.1"></a>Furthermore</span>, it is our command that all those who have been detained in the islands against their will should receive the benefit of this present provision; in order that they who till now have been surrounded by rugged mountains and the encircling barrier of the ocean, being now set free from that gloomy and desolate solitude, may fulfill their fondest wish by revisiting their dearest friends. Those, too, who have prolonged a miserable life in the midst of abject and wretched squalor, welcoming their restoration as an unlooked-for gain, and discarding henceforth all anxious thoughts, may pass their lives with us in freedom from all fear. For that any one could live in a state of fear under our government, when we boast and believe ourselves to be the servants of God, would surely be a thing most extraordinary even to hear of, and quite incredible; and our mission is to rectify the errors of the others.</p>
