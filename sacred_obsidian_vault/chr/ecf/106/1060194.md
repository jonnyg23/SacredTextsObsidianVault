 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.vi.xvi-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="vi.vi.xvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XV.—Of the Consistency of the Accounts Given by Matthew, Mark, and Luke on the Subject of the Parties Who Insulted the Lord.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.vi.xvi-p2"></a>52. Matthew goes on in the following strain: “And they that passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.” <a name="fr_1424"></a><a href="#fn_1424"><font size="1">1425</font></a>
  Marks statement agrees with this almost to the letter. Then Matthew continues thus: “Likewise also the chief priests, mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save: if he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver him now, if He will: for he said, I am the Son of God.” <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1425"><font size="1">1426</font></a>
  Mark and Luke, although they report the words differently, nevertheless agree in conveying the same meaning, although the one passes without notice something which the other mentions. <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">1427</font></a>
  For they are both really at one on the subject of the chief priests, giving us to understand that they insulted the Lord when He was crucified. The only difference is, that Mark does not specify the elders, while Luke, who has instanced the rulers, has not added the designation “of the priests,” and thus has rather comprehended the whole body of the leading men under the general designation; so that we may fairly take both the scribes and the elders to be included in his 				description.</p>
