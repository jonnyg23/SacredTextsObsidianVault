 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.lxxiv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.lxxiv-p1.1"></a>Chapter LXXIII.—Of the Person to Whom the Two Precepts Concerning the Love of God and the Love of Our Neighbour Were Commended; And of the Question as to the Order of Narration Which is Observed by Matthew and Mark, and the Absence of Any Discrepancy Between Them and Luke.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lxxiv-p2"></a>141. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: “But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. And one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great 				commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” <a name="fr_1167"></a><a href="#fn_1167"><font size="1">1168</font></a>
  This is recorded also by Mark, and that too in the same order. Neither should there be any difficulty in the statement made by Matthew, to the effect that the person by whom the question was put to the Lord tempted Him; whereas Mark <a name="fr_1168"></a><a href="#fn_1168"><font size="1">1169</font></a>
  says nothing about that, but tells us at the end of the paragraph how the Lord said to the man, as to one who answered discreetly, “Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.” For it is quite possible that, although the man approached Him with the view of tempting Him, he may have been set right by the Lords response. Or we need not at any rate take the tempting referred to in a bad sense, as if it were the device of one who sought to deceive an adversary; but we may 				rather suppose it to have been the result of caution, as if it were the act of one who wished to have further trial of a person who was unknown to him. For it is not without a good purpose that this sentence has been written, “He that is hasty to give credit is light-minded, and shall be impaired.” <a name="fr_1169"></a><a href="#fn_1169"><font size="1">1170</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lxxiv-p6"></a>142. Luke, on the other hand, not indeed in this order, but in a widely different connection, introduces something which resembles this. <a name="fr_1170"></a><a href="#fn_1170"><font size="1">1171</font></a>
  But whether in that passage he is actually recording this same incident, or whether the person with whom the Lord [is represented to have] dealt in a similar manner there on the subject of those two commandments is quite another individual, is altogether uncertain. At the same time, it may appear right to regard the person who is introduced by Luke as a different individual from the one before us here, not only on the ground of the remarkable divergence in the order of 				narration, but also because he is there reported to have replied to a question which was addressed to him by the Lord, and in that reply to have himself mentioned those two precepts. The same opinion is further confirmed by the fact that, after telling us how the Lord said to him, “This do, and thou shall live,”—thus instructing him to do that great thing which, according to his own answer, was contained in the law,—the evangelist follows up what had passed with the statement, “But 				he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?” <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1171"><font size="1">1172</font></a>
  Thereupon, too [according to Luke], the Lord told the story of the man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers. Consequently, considering that this individual is described at the outset as tempting Christ, and is represented to have repeated the two commandments in his reply; and considering, further, that after the counsel which was given by the Lord in the words, “This do, and thou shalt live,” he is not commended as good, but, on the 				contrary, has this said of him, “But he, willing to justify himself,” etc., whereas the <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a> <a name="vi.v.lxxiv-Page_166"></a>person who is mentioned in parallel order both by Mark and by Luke received a commendation so marked, that the Lord spake to him in these terms, “Thou art not far from the kingdom of God,”—the more probable view is that which takes the person who appears on that occasion to be a different individual from the man who comes before us here.</p>
