 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.lv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.lv-p1.1"></a>Chapter LIV.—Of the Occasion on Which He Announced His Coming Passion to the Disciples, and of the Measure of Concord Between Matthew, Mark, and Luke in the Accounts Which They Give of the Same.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lv-p2"></a>110. Matthew proceeds in the following strain: “Then charged He His disciples that they should tell no man that He was Jesus the Christ. From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He must go into Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and chief priests, and scribes;” and so on, down to where we read, “Thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.” <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">1093</font></a>
  Mark and Luke add these passages in the same order. Only Luke says nothing about the opposition which Peter expressed to the passion of Christ.</p>
