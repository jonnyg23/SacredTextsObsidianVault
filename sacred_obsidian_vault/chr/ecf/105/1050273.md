 <p><a name="xii.xxx-p2"></a>As to his statement, indeed, that “the Lord was able to die without sin;” His being born also was of the ability of His mercy, not the demand of His nature: so, likewise, did He undergo death of His own power; and this is our price which He paid to redeem us from death. Now, this truth their contention labours hard to make of none effect; for human nature is maintained by them to be such, that with free will it wants no such ransom in order to be translated from the power of darkness and of him who has the power of death, <a name="fr_1194"></a><a href="#fn_1194"><font size="1">1195</font></a>
  into the kingdom of Christ the Lord. <a name="fr_1195"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">1196</font></a>
  And yet, when the Lord drew near His passion, He said, “Behold, the prince of this world cometh and shall find nothing in me,” <a name="fr_1196"></a><a href="#fn_1196"><font size="1">1197</font></a>
 —and therefore no sin, of course, on account of which he might exercise dominion over Him, so as to destroy Him. “But,” added He, “that the world may know that I do the will of my Father, arise, let us go hence;” <a name="fr_1197"></a><a href="#fn_1197"><font size="1">1198</font></a>
  as much as to say, I am going to die, not through the necessity of sin, but in voluntariness of obedience.</p>
