 </p><p class="c46"><a name="xvi.vi.iv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.vi.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 3.—The Same Continued.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="xvi.vi.iv-p2"></a>The words which he has quoted and endeavoured to refute out of my book, which I sent to you, and with which you are very well acquainted, are the following: “They are constantly affirming, in their excessive hatred of us, that we condemn marriage and that divine procedure by which God creates human beings by means of men and women, inasmuch as we maintain that they who are born of such a union contract original sin, and do not deny that, of whatever parents they are born, they are still under the devils dominion unless they be born again in <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a> <a name="xvi.vi.iv-Page_284"></a>Christ.” <a name="fr_2195"></a><a href="#fn_2195"><font size="1">2196</font></a>
  Now, in quoting these words of mine, he took care to omit the testimony of the apostle, which I adduced by the weighty significance of which he felt himself too hard pressed. For, after saying that men at their birth contract original sin, I at once introduced the apostles words: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all men sinned.” <a name="fr_2196"></a><a href="#fn_2196"><font size="1">2197</font></a>
  Well, as I have already mentioned, he omitted this passage of the apostle, and then closed up the other remarks of mine which have been now quoted. For he knew too well how acceptable to the hearts and consciences of all faithful catholics are these words of the apostle, which I had adopted, but which he omitted,—words which are so direct and so clear, that these new-fangled heretics use every effort in their dark and tortuous glosses to obscure and deprave their force.</p>
