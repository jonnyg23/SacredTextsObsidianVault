 <p><a name="xvi.vi.xlviii-p2"></a>Still let him ply his question: “By what means may sin be discovered in an infant?” He may find an answer in the inspired pages: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.” “Through the offence of one many are dead.” “The judgment was from one to condemnation.” “By one mans offence death reigned by one.” “By the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation.” “By one mans disobedience many were made sinners.” <a name="fr_2298"></a><a href="#fn_2298"><font size="1">2299</font></a>
  Behold, then, “by what means sins may be discovered in an infant.” Let him now believe in original sin; let him permit infants to come to Christ, that they may be saved. [XXVIII.] What means this passage of his: “He sins not who is born; he sins not who begat him; He sins not who created him. Amidst these intrenchments of innocence, therefore, what are the breaches through which you pretend that sin entered?” Why does he search for a hidden chink when he has an open door? “By one man,” says the apostle; “through the offence of one,” says the apostle; “By one mans disobedience,” says the apostle. What does he want more? What does he require plainer? What does he expect to be more impressively repeated?</p>
