 </p><p class="c46"><a name="x.iii.xlii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="x.iii.xlii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 42.—From the First Epistle of John.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="x.iii.xlii-p2"></a>Moreover, from Johns Epistle I meet with the following words, which seem indispensable to the solution of this question: “But if,” says he, “we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.” <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">346</font></a>
  To the like import he says, in another place: “If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which is greater because He hath testified of His Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believed not in the testimony that God testified of His Son. And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">347</font></a>
  It seems, then, that it is not only the kingdom of heaven, but life also, which infants are not to have, if they have not the Son, whom they can only have by His baptism. So again he says: “For this cause the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.” <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">348</font></a>
  Therefore infants will have no interest in the manifestation of the Son of God, if He do not in them destroy the works of the devil.</p>
