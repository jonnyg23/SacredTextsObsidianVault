 <p><a name="xv.iv.xxxiii-p2"></a>Of this flesh and blood Melchizedek also, when he blessed Abram himself, <a name="fr_1993"></a><a href="#fn_1993"><font size="1">1994</font></a>
  gave the testimony which is very well known to Christian believers, so that long afterwards it was said to Christ in the Psalms: “Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.” <a name="fr_1994"></a><a href="#fn_1994"><font size="1">1995</font></a>
  This was not then an accomplished fact, but was still future; yet that faith of the fathers, which is the self-same faith as our own, used to chant it. Now, to all who find death in Adam, Christ is of this avail, that He is the Mediator for life. He is, however, not a Mediator, because He is equal with the Father; for in this respect He is Himself as far distant from us as the Father; and how can there be any medium where the distance is the very same? Therefore the apostle does not say, “There is one Mediator between God and men, even Jesus Christ;” but his words are, “The <span class="c16"><a name="xv.iv.xxxiii-p4.2"></a>Man</span> Christ Jesus.” <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
  He is the Mediator, then, in that He is man,—inferior to the Father, by so much as He is nearer to ourselves, and superior to us, by so much as He is nearer to the Father. This is more openly expressed thus: “He is inferior to the Father, because in the form of a servant;” <a name="fr_1996"></a><a href="#fn_1996"><font size="1">1997</font></a>
  superior to us, because without spot of sin.</p>
