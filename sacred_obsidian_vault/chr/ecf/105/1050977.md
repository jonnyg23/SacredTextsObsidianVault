 <p><a name="xix.iv.xliii-p2"></a>From these statements of the inspired word, and from similar passages which it would take too long to quote in full, it is, I think, sufficiently clear that God works in the hearts of men to incline their wills whithersoever He wills, whether to good deeds according to His mercy, or to evil after their own deserts; His own judgment being sometimes manifest, sometimes secret, but always righteous. This ought to be the fixed and immoveable conviction of your heart, that there is no unrighteousness with God. Therefore, whenever you read in the Scriptures of Truth, that men are led aside, or that their hearts are blunted and hardened by God, never doubt that some ill deserts of their own have first occurred, so that they justly suffer these things. Thus you will not run counter to that proverb of Solomon: “The foolishness of a man perverteth his ways, yet he blameth God in his heart.” <a name="fr_3211"></a><a href="#fn_3211"><font size="1">3212</font></a>
  Grace, however, is not bestowed according to mens deserts; otherwise grace would be no longer grace. <a name="fr_3212"></a><a href="#fn_3212"><font size="1">3213</font></a>
  For grace is so designated because it is given gratuitously. <a name="fr_3213"></a><a href="#fn_3213"><font size="1">3214</font></a>
  Now if God is able, either through the agency of angels (whether good ones or evil), or in any other way whatever, to operate in the hearts even of the wicked, in return for their deserts,—whose wickedness was not made by Him, but was either derived originally from Adam, or increased by their own will,—what is there to wonder at if, through the Holy Spirit, He works good in the hearts of the elect, who has wrought it that their hearts become good instead of evil?</p>
