 <p><a name="xxi.iii.xi-p2"></a>Now, moreover, when the saints say, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,” <a name="fr_3576"></a><a href="#fn_3576"><font size="1">3577</font></a>
  what do they pray for but that they may persevere in holiness? For, assuredly, when that gift of God is granted to them,—which is sufficiently plainly shown to be Gods gift, since it is asked of Him,—that gift of God, then, being granted to them that they may not be led into temptation, none of the saints fails to keep his perseverance in holiness even to the end. For there is not any one who ceases to persevere in the Christian purpose unless he is first of all led into temptation. If, therefore, it be granted to him according to his prayer that he may not be led, certainly by the gift of God he persists in that sanctification which by the gift of God he has received.</p>
