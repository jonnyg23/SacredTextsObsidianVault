 </p><p class="c46"><a name="xv.iv.xlviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 48.—Pelagius Rightly Condemned and Really Opposed by Ambrose.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="xv.iv.xlviii-p2"></a>These words, however, of the man of God are contradicted by Pelagius, notwithstanding all his commendation of his author, when he himself declares that “we are procreated, as without virtue, so without vice.” <a name="fr_2046"></a><a href="#fn_2046"><font size="1">2047</font></a>
  What remains, then, but that Pelagius should condemn and renounce this error of his; or else be sorry that he has quoted Ambrose in the way he has? Inasmuch, however, as the blessed Ambrose, catholic bishop as he is, has expressed himself in the above-quoted passages in accordance with the catholic faith, it follows that Pelagius, along with his disciple Cœlestius, was justly condemned by the authority of the catholic Church for having turned aside from the true way of faith, since he repented not for having bestowed commendation on Ambrose, and for having at the same time entertained opinions in opposition to him. I know full well with what insatiable avidity you <a name="fr_2047"></a><a href="#fn_2047"><font size="1">2048</font></a>
  read whatever is written for edification and in confirmation of the faith; but yet, notwithstanding its utility as contributing to such an end, I must at last bring this treatise to a conclusion.</p>
