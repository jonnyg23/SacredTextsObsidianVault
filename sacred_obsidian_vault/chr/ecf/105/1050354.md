 <p><a name="xiii.xxii-p2"></a>As long, then, as we are “absent from the Lord, we walk by faith, not by sight;” <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1411"><font size="1">1412</font></a>
  whence it is said, “The just shall live by faith.” <a name="fr_1412"></a><a href="#fn_1412"><font size="1">1413</font></a>
  Our righteousness in this pilgrimage is this—that we press forward to that perfect and full righteousness in which there shall be perfect and full love in the sight of His glory; and that now we hold to the rectitude and perfection of our course, by “keeping under our body and bringing it into subjection,” <a name="fr_1413"></a><a href="#fn_1413"><font size="1">1414</font></a>
  by doing our alms cheerfully and heartily, while bestowing kindnesses and forgiving the trespasses which have been committed against us, and by “continuing instant in prayer;” <a name="fr_1414"></a><a href="#fn_1414"><font size="1">1415</font></a>
 —and doing all this with sound doctrine, whereon are built a right faith, a firm hope, and a pure charity. This is now our righteousness, in which we pass through our course hungering and thirsting after the perfect and full righteousness, in order that we may hereafter be satisfied therewith. Therefore our Lord in the Gospel (after saying, “Take heed that ye do not your righteousness <a name="fr_1415"></a><a href="#fn_1415"><font size="1">1416</font></a>
  before men, to be seen of them,” <a name="fr_1416"></a><a href="#fn_1416"><font size="1">1417</font></a>
 ) in order that we should not measure our course of life by the limit of human glory, declared in his exposition of righteousness itself that there is none except there be these three,—fasting, alms, prayers. Now in <i>the fasting</i> He indicates the entire subjugation of the body; in <i> the alms</i>, all kindness of will and deed, either by giving or forgiving; and in <i>prayers</i> He implies all the rules of a holy desire. So that, although by the subjugation of the body a check is given to that concupiscence, which ought not only to be bridled but to be put altogether out of existence (and which will not be found at all in that state of perfect righteousness, where sin shall be absolutely excluded),—yet it often exerts its immoderate desire even in the use of things which are allowable and right. In that real beneficence in which the just man consults his neighbours welfare, things are sometimes done which are prejudicial, although it was thought that they would be advantageous. Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness and trouble which is expended either falls short of the necessities of the objects, or is of little use under the circumstances, then there steals over us a disappointment which tarnishes that “cheerfulness” which secures to the “giver” the approbation of God. <a name="fr_1417"></a><a href="#fn_1417"><font size="1">1418</font></a>
  This trail of sadness, however, is the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in his kindly purposes. If, then, these considerations, and such as these, be duly weighed, we are only right when we say in our prayers, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” <a name="fr_1418"></a><a href="#fn_1418"><font size="1">1419</font></a>
  But what we say in our prayers we must carry into <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a> <a name="xiii.xxii-Page_165"></a>act, even to loving our very enemies; or if any one who is still a babe in Christ fails as yet to reach this point, he must at any rate, whenever one who has trespassed against him repents and craves his pardon, exercise forgiveness from the bottom of his heart, if he would have his heavenly Father listen to his prayer.</p>
