 <p><a name="xx.iv-p2"></a><span class="c16"><a name="xx.iv-p2.1"></a>I Have</span> read your letter—Valentine, my dearly beloved brother, and you who are associated with him in the service of God—which your Love sent by brother Florus and those who came to us with him; and I gave God thanks that I have known your peace in the Lord and agreement in the truth and ardour in love, by your discourse delivered to us. But that an enemy has striven among you to the subversion of some, has, by the mercy of God and His marvellous goodness in turning his arts to the advantage <a name="fr_3235"></a><a href="#fn_3235"><font size="1">3236</font></a>

There is therefore no need to reconsider again and again all that I have already transmitted to you, sufficiently argued out in a lengthy treatise; <a name="fr_3236"></a><a href="#fn_3236"><font size="1">3237</font></a>

  know what and what kind of questions they are, for the solution and satisfaction of which there arises an authority not human but divine, from which we ought not to depart if we desire to attain to the point whither we are tending.</p>
