 </p><p class="c46"><a name="xii.l-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.l-p1.1"></a>Chapter 46 [XXXIX.]—Shall We Follow Scripture, or Add to Its Declarations?</span></p>   
 <p><a name="xii.l-p2"></a>It is, to be sure, a grand sentence with which he concluded this passage, when he says: “What we read, therefore, let us believe; and what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to add; and let it suffice to have said this of all cases.” On the contrary, I for my part say that we ought not to believe even everything that we read, on the sanction of the apostles advice: “Read all things; hold fast that which is good.” <a name="fr_1240"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">1241</font></a>
  Nor is it wicked to add something which we have not read; for it is in our power to add something which we have <i><span><a name="xii.l-p3.2"></a>bona fide</span></i>experienced as witnesses, even if it so happens that we have not read about it. Perhaps he will say in reply: “When I said this, I was treating of the Holy Scriptures.” Oh how I wish that he were never willing to add, I will not say anything but what he reads in the Scriptures, but in opposition to what he reads in them; that he would only faithfully and obediently hear that which is written there: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in which all have sinned;” <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">1242</font></a>
  and that he would not weaken the grace of the great Physician,—all by his unwillingness to confess that human nature is corrupted! Oh how I wish that he would, as a Christian, read the sentence, “There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved;” <a name="fr_1242"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">1243</font></a>
  and that he would not so uphold the possibility of human nature, as to believe that man can be saved by free will without that Name!</p>
