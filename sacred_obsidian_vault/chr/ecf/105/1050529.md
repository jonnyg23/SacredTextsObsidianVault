 <p><a name="xv.iv.xviii-p2"></a>This being the case, you of course feel that episcopal councils, and the Apostolic See, and the whole Roman Church, and the Roman Empire itself, <a name="fr_1942"></a><a href="#fn_1942"><font size="1">1943</font></a>
  which by Gods gracious favour has become Christian, has been most righteously moved against the authors of this wicked error, until they repent and escape from the snares of the devil. For who can tell whether God may not give them repentance to discover, and acknowledge, and even proclaim His truth, <a name="fr_1943"></a><a href="#fn_1943"><font size="1">1944</font></a>
  and to condemn their own damnable error? But whatever may be the bent of their own will, we cannot doubt that the merciful kindness of the Lord has sought the good of many persons who followed them, for no other reason than because they saw them associated in communion with the catholic Church.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="xv.iv.xviii-p3"></a> Possidius, in his <i>Life of Augustin</i>, ch. 18, says: “Even the most pious Emperor Honorius, upon hearing that the weighty sentence of the catholic Church of God had been pronounced against them, in pursuance of the same, determined that they should be regarded as heretics, under condemnation by his own laws.” These enactments are printed by the Benedictine editors in the second part of their Appendix.</p>
