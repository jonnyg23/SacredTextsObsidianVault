 <p><a name="x.iii.xlvii-p2"></a>To the Colossians he addresses these words: “Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son; in whom we have redemption in the remission of our sins.” <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">367</font></a>
  And again he says: “And ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power: in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead. And you, when ye were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross; and putting the flesh off Him, <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">368</font></a>
  He made a show of principalities and powers, confidently triumphing over them in Himself.” <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">369</font></a>
