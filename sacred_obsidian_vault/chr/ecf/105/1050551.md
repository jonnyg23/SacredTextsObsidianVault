 <p><a name="xv.iv.xl-p2"></a>There was, however, undoubtedly marriage, even when sin had no prior existence; and for no other reason was it that woman, and not a second man, was created as a help for the man. Moreover, those words of God, “Be fruitful and multiply,” <a name="fr_2025"></a><a href="#fn_2025"><font size="1">2026</font></a>
  are not prophetic of sins to be condemned, but a benediction upon the fertility of marriage. For by these ineffable words of His, I mean by the divine methods which are inherent in the truth of His wisdom by which all things were made, God endowed the primeval pair with their seminal power. Suppose, however, that nature had not been dishonoured by sin, God forbid that we should think that marriages in Paradise must have been such, that in them the procreative members would be excited by the mere ardour of lust, and not by the command of the will for producing offspring,—as the foot is for walking, the hand for labour, and the tongue for speech. Nor, as now happens, would the chastity of virginity be corrupted to the conception of offspring by the force of a turbid heat, but it would rather be submissive to the power of the gentlest love; and thus there <a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a> <a name="xv.iv.xl-Page_251"></a>would be no pain, no blood-effusion of the concumbent virgin, as there would also be no groan of the parturient mother. This, however, men refuse to believe, because it has not been verified in the actual condition of our mortal state. Nature, having been vitiated by sin, has never experienced an instance of that primeval purity. But we speak to faithful men, who have learnt to believe the inspired Scriptures, even though no examples are adduced of actual reality. For how could I now possibly <i>prove</i> that a man was made of the dust, without any parents, and a wife formed for him out of his own side? <a name="fr_2026"></a><a href="#fn_2026"><font size="1">2027</font></a>
  And yet faith takes on trust what the eye no longer discovers.</p>
