 <p><a name="xxi.iii.liii-p2"></a>Wherefore, if both the apostles and the teachers of the Church who succeeded them and imitated them did both these things,—that is, both truly preached the grace of God which is not given according to our merits, and inculcated by wholesome precepts a pious obedience,—what is it which these people of our time think themselves rightly bound by the invincible force of truth to say, “Even if what is said of the predestination of Gods benefits be true, yet it <a name="page_547"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 547</font></a> <a name="xxi.iii.liii-Page_547"></a>must not be preached to the people”? <a name="fr_3687"></a><a href="#fn_3687"><font size="1">3688</font></a>
  It must absolutely be preached, so that he who has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them if he has not received them from Him who says, “I will give them a heart to know me, and ears to hear?” <a name="fr_3688"></a><a href="#fn_3688"><font size="1">3689</font></a>
  Assuredly, he who has not received may reject; while, yet, he who receives may take and drink, may drink and live. For as piety must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God may be rightly worshipped; modesty must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, no illicit act may be perpetrated by his fleshly nature; charity must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God and his neighbours may be loved;—so also must be preached such a predestination of Gods benefits that he who has ears to hear may glory, not in himself, but in the Lord.</p>
