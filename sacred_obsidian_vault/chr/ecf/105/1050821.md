 <p><a name="xviii.iii.xxii-p2"></a>And it had once appeared to me also that the apostle was in this argument of his describing a man under the law. <a name="fr_2581"></a><a href="#fn_2581"><font size="1">2582</font></a>
  But afterwards I was constrained to give up the idea by those words where he says, “Now, then, it is no more I that do it.” For to this belongs what he says subsequently also: “There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.” And because I do not see how a man under the law should say, “I delight in the law of God after the inward man;” since this very delight in good, by which, moreover, he does not consent to evil, not from fear of penalty, but from love of righteousness (for this is meant by “delighting”), can only be attributed to grace.</p>
