 <p><a name="xii.lv-p2"></a>But why need we tarry longer on general statements? Let us go into the core of the question, which we have to discuss with our opponents solely, or almost entirely, on one particular point. For inasmuch as he says that “as far as the present question is concerned, it is not pertinent to inquire whether there have been or now are any men in this life without sin, but whether they had or have the ability to be such persons;” so, were I even to allow that there have been or are any such, I should not by any means therefore affirm that they had or have the ability, unless justified by the grace of God through our Lord “Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1257"><font size="1">1258</font></a>
  For the same faith which healed the saints of old now heals us,—that is to say, <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a> <a name="xii.lv-Page_139"></a>faith “in the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,” <a name="fr_1258"></a><a href="#fn_1258"><font size="1">1259</font></a>
 —faith in His blood, faith in His cross, faith in His death and resurrection. As we therefore have the same spirit of faith, we also believe, and on that account also speak.</p>
