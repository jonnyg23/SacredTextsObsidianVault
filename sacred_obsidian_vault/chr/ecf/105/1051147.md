 <p><a name="xxi.iii.lxvii-p2"></a>These things, therefore, which the Church asks from the Lord, and always has asked from the time she began to exist, God so foreknew that He would give to His called, that He has already given them in predestination itself; as the apostle declares without any ambiguity. For, writing to Timothy, he says, “Labour along with the gospel according to the power of God, who saves us, and calls us with His holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of eternity, but is now made manifest by the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ.” <a name="fr_3711"></a><a href="#fn_3711"><font size="1">3712</font></a>
  Let him, therefore, say that the Church at any time has not had in its belief the truth of this predestination and grace, which is now maintained with a more careful heed against the late heretics; let him say this who dares to say that at any time it has not prayed, or not truthfully prayed, as well that unbelievers might believe, as that believers might persevere. And if the Church has always prayed for these benefits, it has always believed them to be certainly Gods gifts; nor was it ever right for it to deny that they were foreknown by Him. And thus Christs Church has never failed to hold the faith of this predestination, which is now being defended with new solicitude against these modern heretics.</p>
