 <p><a name="x.iii.iv-p2"></a>But in addition to the passage where God in punishment said, “Dust thou art, unto dust shalt thou return,” <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">219</font></a>
 —a passage which I cannot understand how any one can apply except to the death of the body,—there are other testimonies likewise, from which it most fully appears that by reason of sin the human race has brought upon itself not spiritual death merely, but the death of the body also. The apostle says to the Romans: “But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. If therefore the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.” <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">220</font></a>
  I think that so clear and open a sentence as this only requires to be read, and not expounded. <i> The body</i>, says he, <i>is dead</i>, not because of earthly frailty, as being made of the dust of the ground, but <i>because of sin</i>; what more do we want? And he is most careful in his words: he does not say “is <i>mortal</i>,” but “<i>dead</i>.”</p>
