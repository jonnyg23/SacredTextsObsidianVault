 <p><a name="xx.xxii-p2"></a>Nor let us wonder that we cannot trace His unsearchable ways. For, to say nothing of innumerable other things which are given by the Lord God to some men, and to others are not given, since with Him is no respect of persons; such things as are not conferred on the merits of will, as bodily swiftness, strength, good health, and beauty of body, marvellous intellects and mental natures capable of many arts, or such as fall to mans lot from without, such as are wealth, nobility, honours, and other things of this kind, which it is in the power of God alone that a man should have; not to dwell even on the baptism of infants (which none of those objectors can say does not pertain, as might be said of those other matters, to the kingdom of God), why it is given to this infant and not given to that, since both of them are equally in Gods power, and without that sacrament none can enter into the kingdom of God;—to be silent, then, on these matters, or to leave them on one side, let men consider those very special cases of which we are treating. For we are discoursing of such as have not perseverance in goodness, but die in the decline of their good will from good to evil. Let the objectors answer, if they can, why, when these were living faithfully and piously, God did not then snatch them from the perils of this life, “lest wickedness should change their understanding, and lest deceit should beguile their souls”? <a name="fr_3306"></a><a href="#fn_3306"><font size="1">3307</font></a>
  Had He not this in His power, or was He ignorant of their future sinfulness? Assuredly, nothing of this kind is said, except most perversely and insanely. Why, then, did He not do this? Let them reply who mock at us when in such matters we exclaim, “How inscrutable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!” <a name="fr_3307"></a><a href="#fn_3307"><font size="1">3308</font></a>
  For either God giveth this to whom He will, or certainly that Scripture is wrong which says concerning the immature death of the righteous man, “He was taken away lest wickedness should change his understanding, or lest deceit should beguile his soul.” <a name="fr_3308"></a><a href="#fn_3308"><font size="1">3309</font></a>
  Why, then, does God give this so great benefit to some, and not give it to others, seeing that in Him is no unrighteousness <a name="fr_3309"></a><a href="#fn_3309"><font size="1">3310</font></a>
  nor acceptance of persons, <a name="fr_3310"></a><a href="#fn_3310"><font size="1">3311</font></a>
  and that it is in His power how long every one may remain in this life, which is called a trial upon earth? <a name="fr_3311"></a><a href="#fn_3311"><font size="1">3312</font></a>
  As, then, they are constrained to confess that it is Gods gift for a man to end this life of his before it can be changed from good to evil, but they do not know why it is given to some and not given to others, so let them confess with us that perseverance in good is Gods gift, according to the Scriptures, from which I have already set down many testimonies; and let them condescend with us to be ignorant, without a murmur against God, why it is given to some and not given to others.</p>
