 <p><a name="xii.xliii-p2"></a>Beyond this, however, although he flatters himself that he vindicates the cause of God by defending nature, he forgets that by predicating soundness of the said nature, he rejects the Physicians mercy. He, however, who created him is also his Saviour. We ought not, therefore, so to magnify the Creator as to be compelled to say, nay, rather as to be convicted of saying, that the Saviour is superfluous. Mans nature indeed we may honour with worthy praise, and attribute the praise to the Creators glory; but at the same time, while we show our gratitude to Him for having created us, let us not be ungrateful to Him for healing us. Our sins which He heals we must undoubtedly attribute not to Gods operation, but to the wilfulness of man, and submit them to <i>His</i> righteous punishment; as, however, we acknowledge that it was in our power that they should not be committed, so let us confess that it lies in His mercy rather than in our own power that they should be healed. But this mercy and remedial help of the Saviour, according to this writer, consists only in this, that He forgives the transgressions that are past, not that He helps us to avoid such as are to come. Here he is most fatally mistaken; here, however unwittingly—here he hinders us from being watchful, and from praying that “we enter not into temptation,” since he <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a> <a name="xii.xliii-Page_135"></a>maintains that it lies entirely in our own control that this should not happen to us.</p>
