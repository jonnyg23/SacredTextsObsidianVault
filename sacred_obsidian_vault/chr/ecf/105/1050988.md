 <p><a name="xx.vii-p2"></a>Let those, therefore, not deceive themselves who ask, “Wherefore is it preached and prescribed to us that we should turn away from evil and do good, if it is not we that do this, but God who worketh in us to will and to do it?” <a name="fr_3249"></a><a href="#fn_3249"><font size="1">3250</font></a>
  But let them rather understand that if they are the children of God, they are led by the Spirit of God <a name="fr_3250"></a><a href="#fn_3250"><font size="1">3251</font></a>
  to do that which should be done; and when they have done it, let them give thanks to Him by whom they act. For they are acted upon that they may act, not that they may themselves do nothing; and in addition to this, it is shown them what they ought to do, so that when they have done it as it ought to be done—that is, with the love and the delight of righteousness—they may rejoice in having received “the sweetness which the Lord has given, that their   <a name="fr_3251"></a><a href="#fn_3251"><font size="1">3252</font></a>
  land should yield her increase.” <a name="fr_3252"></a><a href="#fn_3252"><font size="1">3253</font></a>
  But when they do not act, whether by not doing at all or by not doing from love, let them pray that what as yet they have not, they may receive. For what shall they have which they shall not receive? or what have they which they have not received? <a name="fr_3253"></a><a href="#fn_3253"><font size="1">3254</font></a>
