 <p><a name="xviii.iii.xix-p2"></a>And now does not what follows most plainly show whence he spoke? “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing”? <a name="fr_2574"></a><a href="#fn_2574"><font size="1">2575</font></a>
  For if he had not explained what he said by the addition of “that is, in my flesh,” it might, perchance, be otherwise understood, <a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 384</font></a> <a name="xviii.iii.xix-Page_384"></a>when he said, “in me.” And therefore he repeats and urges the same thing in another form: “For to will is present with me, but to perform that which is good is not.” <a name="fr_2575"></a><a href="#fn_2575"><font size="1">2576</font></a>
  For this is to perform that which is good, that a man should not even lust. For the good is incomplete when one lusts, even although a man does not consent to the evil of lust. “For the good that I would,” says he, “I do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” <a name="fr_2576"></a><a href="#fn_2576"><font size="1">2577</font></a>
  This he repeated impressively, and as it were to stir up the most slothful from slumber: “I find then that the law,” said he, “is for me wishing to do good, since evil is present with me.” <a name="fr_2577"></a><a href="#fn_2577"><font size="1">2578</font></a>
  The law, then, is for one who would do good, but evil is present from lust, though he does not consent to this who says, “It is no longer I that do it.”</p>
