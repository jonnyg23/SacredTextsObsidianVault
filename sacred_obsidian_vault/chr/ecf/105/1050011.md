 <p class="c6"><a name="vi-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="vi-p3.1"></a>TO The Right Reverend The Lord Bishop OF Exeter.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="vi-p4"></a><span class="c16"><a name="vi-p4.1"></a>My Dear Lord</span>,—I gladly avail myself of your permission to dedicate this volume to you. In the course of a professional life of nearly the third of a century, which has not been idly spent, I have never failed to find pleasure in theological pursuits. In the intervals of most pressing labour, these have often tended to refresh and comfort ones wearied spirit. If this confession of my own experience should have any weight with any one in our sacred  calling to combine the hard work which we owe to others while ministering to their wants, with “that diligent attendance to reading” which we require for ourselves, to inform our minds and refresh our spirits, I shall have accomplished my only purpose in making it. Your Lordship, I am sure, will entirely approve of such a combination of employments in your clergy. I well remember your recommendation of theological study to us at the opening of Bishop Phillpotts Library at Truro; and how you  counselled us the more earnestly to pursue it, from the danger there is, in these busy times, of merging the acquisition of sacred learning in the active labours of our holy vocation. That the divine blessing may crown the work which you are so diligently prosecuting in the several functions of your high office, is the earnest wish, my dear Lord, of your faithful servant,</p>
