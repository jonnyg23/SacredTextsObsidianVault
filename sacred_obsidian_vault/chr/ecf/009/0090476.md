 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p1.1"></a>3.  The Harmony of Body, Soul, and Spirit.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.iii-p2"></a>And next to this about the married, I am familiar also with another interpretation of the agreement between the two which is as follows.  In the wicked, sin reigns over the soul, being settled as on its own throne in this mortal body, so that the soul obeys the lusts thereof; <a name="fr_6063"></a><a href="#fn_6063"><font size="1">6064</font></a>
  but in the case of those, who have stirred up the sin which formerly reigned over the body as from a throne and who are in conflict with it, “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;” <a name="fr_6064"></a><a href="#fn_6064"><font size="1">6065</font></a>
  but in the case of those who have now become perfected, the spirit has gained the mastery and put to death the deeds of the body, and imparts to the body of its own life, so that already this is fulfilled, “He shall quicken also your mortal bodies because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you;” <a name="fr_6065"></a><a href="#fn_6065"><font size="1">6066</font></a>
  and there arises a concord of the two, body and spirit, on the earth, on the successful accomplishment of which there is sent up a harmonious prayer also of him who “with the heart believes unto righteousness, but with the mouth maketh confession unto salvation,” <a name="fr_6066"></a><a href="#fn_6066"><font size="1">6067</font></a>
  so that the heart is no longer far from God, and along with this the righteous man draws nigh to God with his own lips and mouth.  But still more blessed is it if the three be gathered together in the name of Jesus that this may be fulfilled, “May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <a name="fr_6067"></a><a href="#fn_6067"><font size="1">6068</font></a>
   But some one may inquire with regard to the concord of spirit and body spoken of, if it is possible for these to be at concord without the third being so,—I mean the soul—and whether it does not follow from the concord of these on the earth after the two have been gathered together in the name of Christ, that the three also are already gathered together in His name, in the midst of whom comes the Son of God as all are dedicated to Him,—I mean the three,—and no one is opposed to Him, there being no antagonism not only on the part of the spirit, but not even of the soul, nor further of the body.</p>
