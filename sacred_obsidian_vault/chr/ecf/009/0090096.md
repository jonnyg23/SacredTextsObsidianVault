 <p class="c13"><a name="xii.iv.i-p10"></a>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events <a name="fr_3998"></a><a href="#fn_3998"><font size="1">3999</font></a>
  which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which you consulted us; and especially to that shameful and detestable sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved, has suffered grievous injury. <a name="fr_3999"></a><a href="#fn_3999"><font size="1">4000</font></a>
   For who ever dwelt even for a short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly established? <a name="fr_4000"></a><a href="#fn_4000"><font size="1">4001</font></a>
   Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ?  Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality?  And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge?  For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you.  Ye enjoined young men to be of a sober and serious mind, ye instructed your wives to do all things with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.</p>
