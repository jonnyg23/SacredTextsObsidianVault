 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xxvii-p2"></a>Another point which we must not fail to notice is that when Elijah was about to be taken up in a whirlwind, as if to heaven, <a name="fr_4941"></a><a href="#fn_4941"><font size="1">4942</font></a>
  he took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the water, which was divided hither and thither, and they went over both of them, that is, he and Elisha.  His baptism in the Jordan made him fitter to be taken up, for, as we showed before, Paul gives the name of baptism to such a remarkable passage through the water.  And through this same Jordan Elisha receives, through Elijah, the gift he desired, saying, “Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.”  What enabled him to receive this gift of the spirit of Elijah was, perhaps, that he had passed through Jordan twice, once with Elijah, and the second time, when, after receiving the mantle of Elijah, he smote the water and said, “Where is the God of Elijah, even He?  And he smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither.”</p>
