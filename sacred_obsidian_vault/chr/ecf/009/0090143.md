 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xii.iv.xlviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLVIII.—Let Us Return to the Practice of Brotherly Love.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xlviii-p2"></a>Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end <a name="fr_4260"></a><a href="#fn_4260"><font size="1">4261</font></a>
  to this [state of things]; and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with tears, that He would mercifully <a name="fr_4261"></a><a href="#fn_4261"><font size="1">4262</font></a>
  be reconciled to us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love.  For [such conduct] is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the attainment of life, as it is written, “Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord:  this is the gate of the <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a> <a name="xii.iv.xlviii-Page_244"></a>Lord:  the righteous shall enter in by it.” <a name="fr_4262"></a><a href="#fn_4262"><font size="1">4263</font></a>
   Although, therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in Christ by which blessed are all they that have entered in and have directed their way in holiness and righteousness, doing all things without disorder.  Let a man be faithful:  let him be powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the more he seems to be superior to others [in these respects], the more humble-minded ought he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage.</p>
