 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xxxi-p2"></a>John the disciple does not tell us where the Saviour comes from to John the Baptist, but we learn this from Matthew, who writes: <a name="fr_4951"></a><a href="#fn_4951"><font size="1">4952</font></a>
   “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.”  And Mark adds the place in Galilee; he says, <a name="fr_4952"></a><a href="#fn_4952"><font size="1">4953</font></a>
  “And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in Jordan.”  Luke does not mention the place Jesus came from, but on the other hand he tells us what we do not learn from the others, that immediately after the baptism, as He was coming up, heaven was opened to Him, and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form like a dove.  Again, it is Matthew alone who tells us of Johns preventing the Lord, saying to the Saviour, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”  None of the others added this after Matthew, so that they might not be saying just the same as he.  And what the Lord rejoined, “Suffer it now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,” this also Matthew alone recorded.</p>
