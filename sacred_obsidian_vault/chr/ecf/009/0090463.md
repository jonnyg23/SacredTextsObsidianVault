 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxii-p2"></a>“<i>And it must needs be that occasions of stumbling come,</i>” <a name="fr_5963"></a><a href="#fn_5963"><font size="1">5964</font></a>
  which I take to be different from the men by whom they come.  The occasions then which come are an army of the devil, his angels, and a wicked band of impure spirits, which, seeking out instruments through whom they will work, often find men altogether strangers to piety, and sometimes even some of those who are thought to believe the Word of God, for whom exists a worse woe than that which comes to him who is caused to stumble, just as also it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, <a name="fr_5964"></a><a href="#fn_5964"><font size="1">5965</font></a>
  than for the places where Jesus did signs and wonders, and yet was not believed.  But as one might undertake to make a collection from the Scriptures of those who are pronounced blessed, and of the things in respect of which they are so called, so also he might undertake to do with the woes which are written, and those in whose case the woes are spoken.  But that the woe is worse in the case of him who causes to stumble, than in him who is made to stumble, you may prove by the passage, “Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these little ones which believe in Me, it is profitable for him,” <a name="fr_5965"></a><a href="#fn_5965"><font size="1">5966</font></a>
  etc.; for, while the little one who is made to stumble receives retribution from him who caused him to stumble, it is expedient that the severe and intolerable punishment which is written should befall the man who has caused the stumbling.  But if we were to give more careful consideration to these things, we should be on our guard against sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, lest we sin against Christ; <a name="fr_5966"></a><a href="#fn_5966"><font size="1">5967</font></a>
  as often our brethren about us, “for whom Christ died,” perish, not only through our knowledge, but also through some other causes connected with us; in the case of whom, we, sinning against Christ, shall pay the penalty, the soul of them who perish through us being required of us.</p>
