 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxvii-p2"></a>But at the same time also observe that at the beginning it is said, “Whosoever wills,” but afterwards, “Whoso shall lose.” <a name="fr_5728"></a><a href="#fn_5728"><font size="1">5729</font></a>
   If we then wish it to be saved let us lose it to the world, as those who have been crucified with Christ and have for our glorying that which is in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world is to be crucified unto us and we unto the world, <a name="fr_5729"></a><a href="#fn_5729"><font size="1">5730</font></a>
  that we may gain our end, even the salvation of our lives, which begins from the time when we lose it for the sake of the word.  But if we think that the salvation of our life is a blessed thing, with reference to the salvation which is in God and the blessednesses with Him, then any loss of life ought to be a good thing, and, for the sake of Christ must prove to be the prelude to the blessed salvation.  It seems to me, therefore, following the analogy of self-denial, according to what has been said, that each ought to lose his own life.  Let each one therefore lose his own sinning life, that having lost that which is sinful, he may receive that which is saved by right actions; but a man will in no way be profited if he shall gain the whole world.  Now he gains the world, I think, to whom the world is not crucified; and to whom the world is not crucified, to that man shall be the loss of his own life.  But when two things are put before us, either by gaining ones life to forfeit the world, or by gaining the world to forfeit ones life, much more desirable is the choice, that we should forfeit the world and gain our life by losing it on account of Christ.</p>
