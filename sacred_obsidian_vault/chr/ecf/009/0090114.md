 <p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xix-p2"></a>Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth.  Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the beginning was the mark set before us; <a name="fr_4093"></a><a href="#fn_4093"><font size="1">4094</font></a>
  and let us look stedfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace.  Let us contemplate Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His long-suffering will.  Let us reflect how free from the wrath He is towards all His creation.</p>
