 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxvi-p2"></a>“<i>For whosoever would save his own life shall lose it.</i>” <a name="fr_5727"></a><a href="#fn_5727"><font size="1">5728</font></a>
   The first expression is ambiguous; for it may be understood in one way thus.  If any one as being a lover of life, and thinking that the present life is good, tends carefully his own life with a view to living in the flesh, being afraid to die, as through death going to lose it, this man, by the very willing to save in this way his own life will lose it, placing it outside of the borders of blessedness.  But if any one despising the present life because of my word, which has persuaded him to strive in regard to eternal life even unto death for truth, loses his own life, surrendering it for the sake of piety to that which is commonly called death, this man, as for my sake he has lost his life, will save it rather, and keep it in possession.  And according to a second way we might interpret the saying as follows.  If any one, who has grasped what salvation really is, wishes to procure the salvation of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life, and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this kind—salvation.</p>
