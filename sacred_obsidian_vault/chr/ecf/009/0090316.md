 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.vi.i-p3"></a>“After this <a name="fr_4987"></a><a href="#fn_4987"><font size="1">4988</font></a>
  He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and there they abode not many days.  And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and He found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting, and He made a sort of scourge of cords, and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the small money of the changers and overthrew their tables, and to those that sold the doves He said, Take these things hence; make not My Fathers house a house of merchandize.  Then His disciples remembered that it was written, that the zeal of thy house shall eat me up.  The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What sign showest Thou unto us, that Thou doest such things?  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.  The Jews therefore answered, Forty-six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?  But He spoke of the temple of His body.  When therefore He rose from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus said.  Now when He was at Jerusalem at the passover at the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did.  But Jesus Himself did not trust Himself to them, for that He knew all men, and because He had no need that any should bear witness concerning man.  For He Himself knew what was in man.”</p> 
 <p class="c13"><a name="xv.iii.vi.i-p5"></a>The numbers which are recorded in the book of that name <a name="fr_4988"></a><a href="#fn_4988"><font size="1">4989</font></a>
  obtained a place in Scripture in accordance with some principle which determines their proportion to each thing.  We ought therefore to enquire whether the book of Moses which is called Numbers teaches us, should we be able to trace it out, in some special way, the principle with regard to this matter.  This remark I make to you at the outset of my tenth book, for in many passages of Scripture I have observed the number ten to have a peculiar privilege, and you may consider carefully whether the hope is justified that this volume will bring you from God some special benefit.  That this may prove to be the case, we will seek to yield ourselves as fully as we can to God, who loves to bestow His choicest gifts.  The book begins at the words:  “After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples, and there they abode not many days.”  The other three Evangelists say that the Lord, after His conflict with the devil, departed into Galilee.  Matthew and Luke represent that he was first at Nazara, <a name="fr_4989"></a><a href="#fn_4989"><font size="1">4990</font></a>
  and then left them and came and dwelt in Capernaum.  Matthew and Mark also state a certain reason why He departed thither, namely, that He had heard that John was cast into prison.  The words are as follows:  Matthew says, <a name="fr_4990"></a><a href="#fn_4990"><font size="1">4991</font></a>
  “Then the devil leaveth Him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.  But when He heard that John was delivered up, He departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt at Capernaum on the seashore in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;” and after the quotation from Isaiah:  “From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”  Mark has the following: <a name="fr_4991"></a><a href="#fn_4991"><font size="1">4992</font></a>
   “And He was in the desert forty days and forty nights tempted by Satan, and He was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him.  But after John was delivered up Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of God, that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe in the Gospel.”  Then after the narrative about Andrew and Peter and James and John, Mark writes:  “And He entered into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath He was teaching in the synagogue.”  Luke has, <a name="fr_4992"></a><a href="#fn_4992"><font size="1">4993</font></a>
  “And having finished the temptation the devil departed from Him for a season.  And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and a fame went out <a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 382</font></a> <a name="xv.iii.vi.i-Page_382"></a>concerning Him into all the region round about, and He taught in their synagogues being glorified of all.  And He came to Nazara, where He had been brought up, and He entered as His custom was into the synagogue on the Sabbath day.”  Then Luke <a name="fr_4993"></a><a href="#fn_4993"><font size="1">4994</font></a>
  gives what He said at Nazara, and how those in the synagogue were enraged at Him and cast Him out of the city and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their cities were built, to cast Him down headlong, and how going through the midst of them the Lord went His way; and with this he connects the statement, “And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath day.”</p>
