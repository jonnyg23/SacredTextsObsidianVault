 <p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xlv-p2"></a>Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things which do not pertain to salvation.  Look carefully into the Scriptures, which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit.  Observe <a name="fr_4236"></a><a href="#fn_4236"><font size="1">4237</font></a>
  that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.  There <a name="fr_4237"></a><a href="#fn_4237"><font size="1">4238</font></a>
  you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men who themselves were holy.  The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked.  They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them.  Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously.  For what shall we say, brethren?  Was Daniel <a name="fr_4238"></a><a href="#fn_4238"><font size="1">4239</font></a>
  cast into the den of lions by such as <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a> <a name="xii.iv.xlv-Page_243"></a>feared God?  Were Ananias, and Azarias, and Michael shut up in a furnace <a name="fr_4239"></a><a href="#fn_4239"><font size="1">4240</font></a>
  of fire by those who observed <a name="fr_4240"></a><a href="#fn_4240"><font size="1">4241</font></a>
  the great and glorious worship of the Most High?  Far from us be such a thought!  Who, then, were they that did such things?  The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure conscience venerate <a name="fr_4241"></a><a href="#fn_4241"><font size="1">4242</font></a>
  His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.  But they who with confidence endured [these things] are now heirs of glory and honour, and have been exalted and made illustrious <a name="fr_4242"></a><a href="#fn_4242"><font size="1">4243</font></a>
  by God in their memorial for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>
