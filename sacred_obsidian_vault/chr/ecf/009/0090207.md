 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.i.xi-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.i.xi-p1.1"></a>11.  Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the Gospel is Manifold.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xi-p2"></a>Let no one wonder if we have understood Jesus to be announced in the Gospel under a plurality of names of good things.  If we look at the things by the names of which the Son of God is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet are beautiful.  One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life.  Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is true light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said to be.  And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or light is the truth.  And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the truth.  And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, <a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a> <a name="xv.iii.i.xi-Page_303"></a>when He says: <a name="fr_4500"></a><a href="#fn_4500"><font size="1">4501</font></a>
   “I am the way and the truth and the life.”  Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says: <a name="fr_4501"></a><a href="#fn_4501"><font size="1">4502</font></a>
   “I am the resurrection.”  But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness.  Now Christ says: <a name="fr_4502"></a><a href="#fn_4502"><font size="1">4503</font></a>
   “I am the door.”  And what need is there to speak of wisdom, which “the Lord created <a name="fr_4503"></a><a href="#fn_4503"><font size="1">4504</font></a>
  the first principle of His ways, for His works,” in whom the father of her rejoiced, delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm?  A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful.  And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ.  Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all.  For this also is a good, less than no other.  Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose feet are beautiful.  Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the good things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His death he would die to sin.  For “Christ, <a name="fr_4504"></a><a href="#fn_4504"><font size="1">4505</font></a>
  in that He died, died unto sin once.”  But from His life, since “in that He liveth, He liveth unto God,” every one who is conformed to His resurrection receives that living to God.  But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption?  And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying <a name="fr_4505"></a><a href="#fn_4505"><font size="1">4506</font></a>
  that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption.  Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom <a name="fr_4506"></a><a href="#fn_4506"><font size="1">4507</font></a>
  “it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily,” and which are not contained in writings.  Why should I say, “are not contained in writings”?  For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says: <a name="fr_4507"></a><a href="#fn_4507"><font size="1">4508</font></a>
   “I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.”  Now to say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things.  For this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these good things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy good things.  But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says: <a name="fr_4508"></a><a href="#fn_4508"><font size="1">4509</font></a>
   “I myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things; for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O Zion!”  For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth?  And these must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the injunction which says: <a name="fr_4509"></a><a href="#fn_4509"><font size="1">4510</font></a>
   Go up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!”  Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others.  And He who goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed by His good Father, <a name="fr_4510"></a><a href="#fn_4510"><font size="1">4511</font></a>
  who “makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust,” He does not despise those who are poor in soul.  To them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah <a name="fr_4511"></a><a href="#fn_4511"><font size="1">4512</font></a>
  and reads:  “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind.  For closing the book He handed it to the minister and sat down.  And when the eyes of all were fastened upon Him, He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.”</p>
