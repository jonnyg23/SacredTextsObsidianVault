 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></a>18.  Concerning the Multitudes Who Were Healed.  Comparison of the Mountain Where Jesus Sat to the Church.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-p2"></a>“<i>And Jesus departed thence,</i>”—manifestly, from what has been said before, from the parts of Tyre and Sidon,—“<i>and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee,</i>” <a name="fr_5525"></a><a href="#fn_5525"><font size="1">5526</font></a>
  which is commonly called the Lake of Gennesaret, and again went up into the mountain where He went up and sat.  We may say, then, that into this mountain where Jesus sits, not only the sound in health go up, but along with the sound, those also who were suffering from various disorders.  And, perhaps, this mountain to which Jesus went up and sat is that which is more commonly called the Church, which has been set up through the word of God over the rest of the world and the men upon it; whither go not the disciples only, leaving the multitudes as in the case of the beatitudes, but great multitudes who were not accused themselves of being deaf or suffering from any affection, but who had such along with themselves.  For you may see, along with the multitudes who come to this mountain where the Son of God sits, some who have become deaf to the things promised, and others blind in soul and not looking at the true light, and others who are lame and not able to walk according to reason, and others who are maimed and not able to work according to reason.  Those, accordingly, who are suffering in soul from such things, though they go up along with the multitudes into the mountain where Jesus was, so long as they are outside of the feet of Jesus, are not healed by Him; but when, as men suffering from such disorders, they are cast by the multitude at His feet, <a name="fr_5526"></a><a href="#fn_5526"><font size="1">5527</font></a>
  and at the extremities of the body of Christ, not being worthy to obtain such things so far as they themselves are concerned, they are then healed by Him.  And when you see in the congregation of what is more commonly called the church the catechumens cast behind those who are at the extreme end of it, and as it were at the feet of the body of Jesus—the church—coming to it with their own deafness and blindness and lameness and crookedness, and in time cured according to the Word, you would not err in saying that such having gone up with the multitudes of the church to the mountain where Jesus was, are cast at His feet and are healed; so that the multitude of the church is astonished at beholding transformations which have taken place from so great evils to that which is better, so that it might say, those who were formerly dumb afterwards speak the word of God, and the lame walk, the prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled, not only in things bodily but in things spiritual, which said, “Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of him that hath an impediment in his speech be plain.” <a name="fr_5527"></a><a href="#fn_5527"><font size="1">5528</font></a>
   And there, unless the expression, “the lame man shall leap as an hart,” is to be taken as accidental, we will say that those formerly lame, <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 448</font></a> <a name="xvi.ii.iv.xviii-Page_448"></a>and who now through the power of Jesus leap as an hart are not without design compared to a hart, which is a clean animal, and hostile to serpents and cannot at all be injured by their poison.  But also, in respect of the fact that the dumb are seen speaking is the prophecy fulfilled which said, “And the tongue of him that hath an impediment shall be plain,” or rather that which said, “Hear ye deaf;” but the blind see according to the prophecy following, “Hear ye deaf, and ye blind look up that ye may see.” <a name="fr_5528"></a><a href="#fn_5528"><font size="1">5529</font></a>
   Now the blind see, when they see the world and from the exceeding great beauty of the things created they contemplate the Creator corresponding in greatness and beauty to them; and when they see clearly “the invisible things of God Himself from the creation of the world, which are perceived through the things that are made;” <a name="fr_5529"></a><a href="#fn_5529"><font size="1">5530</font></a>
  that is, they see and understand with care and clearness.  Now the multitudes seeing these things, glorified the God of Israel, <a name="fr_5530"></a><a href="#fn_5530"><font size="1">5531</font></a>
  and glorify Him in the persuasion that it is the same God, who is the Father of Him who healed those previously mentioned, and the God of Israel.  For He is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. <a name="fr_5531"></a><a href="#fn_5531"><font size="1">5532</font></a>
   Let us then cause to go up along with ourselves to the mountain where Jesus sits—His church—those who wish to go up to it along with us, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the maimed and many others, and let us cast them at the feet of Jesus that He may heal them, so that the multitudes are astonished at their healing; for it is not the disciples who are described as wondering at such things, although at that time they were present with Jesus, as is manifest from the words, “And Jesus called unto Him His disciples and said, I have compassion on the multitudes,” <a name="fr_5532"></a><a href="#fn_5532"><font size="1">5533</font></a>
  etc.; and perhaps if you attend carefully to the words, “There came unto Him great multitudes,” <a name="fr_5533"></a><a href="#fn_5533"><font size="1">5534</font></a>
  you would find that the disciples at that time did not come to Him, but had begun long ago to follow Him and followed Him into the mountain.  But there came unto Him those who were inferior to the disciples, and were then for the first time approaching Him, who had not the same experience as those who had gone up with them.  Observe, moreover, in the Gospel who are described as having followed Jesus, and who as having come to Him, and who as having been brought to Him, and the division between those who go before and of those who follow; and of those who came, who came to Him in the house, and who when He was elsewhere.  For by observation, and by comparing things spiritual with spiritual, you would find many things worthy of the accurate wisdom in the Gospels.</p>
