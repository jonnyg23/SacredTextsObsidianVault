 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.ii.xxvi-p2"></a>Now we know voice and speech to be different things.  The voice can be produced without any meaning and with no speech in it, and similarly speech can be reported to the mind without voice, as when we make mental excursions, within ourselves.  And thus the Saviour is, in one view of Him, speech, and John differs from Him; for as the Saviour is speech, John is voice.  John himself invites me to take this view of him, for to those who asked who he was, he answered, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord! make His paths straight!”  This explains, perhaps, how it was that Zacharias lost his voice at the birth of the voice which points out the Word of God, and only recovered it when the voice, forerunner of the Word, was born.  A voice must be perceived with the ears if the mind is afterwards to receive the speech which the voice indicates.  Hence, John is, in point of his birth, a little older than Christ, for our voice comes to us before our speech.  But John also points to Christ; for speech is brought forward by the voice.  And Christ is baptized by John, though John declares himself to have need to be baptized by Christ; for with men speech is purified by voice, though the natural way is that speech should purify the voice which indicates it.  In a word, when John points out Christ, it is man pointing out God, the Saviour incorporeal, the voice pointing out the Word.</p>
