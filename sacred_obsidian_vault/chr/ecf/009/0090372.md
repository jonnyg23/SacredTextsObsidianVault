 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxi-p2"></a>The narrative of Matthew is as follows,—“<i>for Herod had laid hold on John and bound him in the prison.</i>” <a name="fr_5311"></a><a href="#fn_5311"><font size="1">5312</font></a>
   In reference to these things, it seems to me, that as the law and the prophets were until John, <a name="fr_5312"></a><a href="#fn_5312"><font size="1">5313</font></a>
  after whom the grace of prophecy ceased from among the Jews; so the authority of those who had rule among the people, which included the power to kill those whom they thought worthy of death, existed until John; and when the last of the prophets was unlawfully killed by Herod, the king of the Jews was deprived of the power of putting to death; for, if Herod had not been deprived of it, Pilate would not have condemned Jesus to death; but for this Herod would have sufficed along with the council of the chief priests and elders of the people, met for the purpose.  And then I think was fulfilled that which was spoken as follows by Jacob to Judah:  “A ruler shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader from Israel, until that come which is laid up in store, and he is the expectation of the Gentiles.” <a name="fr_5313"></a><a href="#fn_5313"><font size="1">5314</font></a>
   And perhaps also the Jews were deprived of this power, the Providence of God arranging for the spread of the teaching of Christ among the people, so that even if this were hindered by the Jews, the opposition might not go so far as the slaying of believers, which seemed to be according to law.  “But Herod laid hold on John and bound him in prison and put him away,” <a name="fr_5314"></a><a href="#fn_5314"><font size="1">5315</font></a>
  by this act signifying that, so far as it depended on his power and on the wickedness of the people, he bound and imprisoned the prophetic word, and prevented him from continuing to abide a herald the truth in freedom as formerly.  But this Herod did for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.  For John said unto him, “It is not lawful for thee to have her.” <a name="fr_5315"></a><a href="#fn_5315"><font size="1">5316</font></a>
   Now this Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituræa and of Trachonitis.  Some, then, suppose that, when Philip died leaving a daughter, Herodias, Herod married his brothers wife, though the law permitted marriage only when there were no children.  But, as we find nowhere clear evidence that Philip was dead, we conclude that a yet greater transgression was done by Herod, namely, that he had induced his brothers wife to revolt from her husband while he was still living.</p>
