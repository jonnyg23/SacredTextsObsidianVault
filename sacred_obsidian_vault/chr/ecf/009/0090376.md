 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p1.1"></a>25.  Healing Precedes Participation in the Loaves of Jesus.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-p2"></a>After this the word says, “<i>And when</i> <a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 431</font></a> <a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxv-Page_431"></a><i>even was come, His disciples came to Him, saying, The place is desert and the time is already past; send, therefore, the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.</i>” <a name="fr_5334"></a><a href="#fn_5334"><font size="1">5335</font></a>
   And first observe that when about to give to the disciples the loaves of blessing, that they might set them before the multitudes, He healed the sick, in order that, having been restored to health, they might participate in the loaves of blessing; for while they are yet sickly, they are not able to receive the loaves of the blessing of Jesus.  But if any one, when he ought to listen to the precept, “But let each prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread,” etc., <a name="fr_5335"></a><a href="#fn_5335"><font size="1">5336</font></a>
  does not obey these words, but in haphazard fashion participates in the bread of the Lord and His cup, he becomes weak or sickly, or even—if I may use the expression—on account of being stupefied by the power of the bread, asleep.</p>
