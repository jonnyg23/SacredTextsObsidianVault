 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.v.iii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.v.iii-p1.1"></a>3.  The Answer of Jesus to Their Request.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.iii-p2"></a>Next let us remark in what way, when asked in regard to one sign, that He might show it from heaven, to the Pharisees and Sadducees who put the question, He answers and says, “<i>An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet,</i> ” when also, “He left them and departed.” <a name="fr_5567"></a><a href="#fn_5567"><font size="1">5568</font></a>
   But the sign of Jonah, in truth, according to their question, was not merely a sign but also a sign from heaven; so that even to those who tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless, out of His own great goodness gave the sign.  For if, as Jonah passed three days and three nights in the whales belly, so the Son of man did in the heart of the earth, and after this rose up from it,—whence but from heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection of Christ came?  And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a sign to the robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the paradise of God; after this, I think, descending into Hades to the dead, “as free among the dead.” <a name="fr_5568"></a><a href="#fn_5568"><font size="1">5569</font></a>
   And the Saviour seems to me to conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the reason of the sign in regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a sign like to that is granted by Him but that very sign; for attend to the words, “And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.” <a name="fr_5569"></a><a href="#fn_5569"><font size="1">5570</font></a>
   Accordingly that sign was this sign, because that became indicative of this, so that the elucidation of that sign, which was obscure on the face of it, might be found in the fact that the Saviour suffered, and passed three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  At the same time also we learn the general principle that, if the sign signifies something, each of the signs which are recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way of precept, is indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for example, the sign of Jonah going out after three days from the whales belly was indicative of the resurrection of our Saviour, rising after three days and three nights from the dead; and that which is called circumcision is the sign of that which is indicated by Paul in the words:  “We are the circumcision.” <a name="fr_5570"></a><a href="#fn_5570"><font size="1">5571</font></a>
   Seek you also every sign in the Old Scriptures as indicative of some passage in the New Scripture, and that which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of something either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent generations after that the sign has taken place.</p>
