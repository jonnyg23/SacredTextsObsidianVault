 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></a>28.  Close Relationship of Angels to Their “Little Ones.”</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p2"></a>With reference to the words, “<i>When through the laver I became a child in Christ,</i>” <a name="fr_5998"></a><a href="#fn_5998"><font size="1">5999</font></a>
  it may be said, that there is no holy angel present with those who are still in wickedness, but that during the period of unbelief they are under the angels of Satan; <a name="fr_5999"></a><a href="#fn_5999"><font size="1">6000</font></a>
  but, after the regeneration, He who has redeemed us with His own blood consigns us to a holy angel, who also, because of his purity, beholds the face of God.  And a third exposition of this passage might be something like the following, which would say, that as it is possible for a man to change from unbelief to faith, and from intemperance to temperance, and generally from wickedness to virtue, so also it is possible that the angel, to whom any soul has been entrusted at birth, may be wicked at the first, but afterwards may at some time believe in proportion as the man believes, and may make such advance that he may become one of the angels who always behold the face of the Father in heaven, <a name="fr_6000"></a><a href="#fn_6000"><font size="1">6001</font></a>
  beginning from the time that he is yoked along with the man who was foreknown and foreordained to believe at that time, the judgments of God, which are unspeakable and unsearchable and like to the depths, fitly bringing together all this harmonious relationship—angels with men.  And it may be that as when a man and his wife are both unbelievers, sometimes it is the man who first believes and in time saves his wife, and sometimes the wife who begins and afterwards in time persuades her husband, so it happens with angels and with men.  If, however, anything of this kind takes place in the case of other angels or not, you may seek out for yourself.  But consider whether it may not be appropriate to say something of this kind in regard to each angel who is so honoured according to the word of the Saviour, that he is said to behold always the face of the Father who is in heaven.  But since in what we said above, that the little ones have angels, but that the great have passed beyond such a position, some one will quote in opposition to us from the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written, that a certain maid Rhoda, when Peter knocked at the door, came to answer, and recognizing the voice of Peter, ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate; but when they who were gathered together in the house wondered, and thought that it was quite impossible that Peter verily stood before the gate, they said, It is his angel. <a name="fr_6001"></a><a href="#fn_6001"><font size="1">6002</font></a>
   For the objector will say that, as they had learned once for all that each of the believers had some definite angel, they knew that Peter also had one.  But he, who adheres to what we have previously said, will say that the word of Rhoda was not necessarily a dogma, and perhaps also the word of those who did not accurately know, when one as being little and God-fearing is governed by angels, and when now by the Lord Himself.  After this, in order to establish our conception of the little one which we have brought forward, it will be said that we need no command about “not despising” in the case of the great, but we do need it in the case of the little; wherefore it is not merely said, “Do not despise one of these,” pointing to all the disciples, but “one of these little ones,” <a name="fr_6002"></a><a href="#fn_6002"><font size="1">6003</font></a>
  pointed out by Him, who sees the littleness and the greatness of the soul.</p>
