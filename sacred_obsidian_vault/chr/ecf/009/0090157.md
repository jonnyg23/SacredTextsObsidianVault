 <p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.lxii-p2"></a>Concerning the things pertaining to our religious observance which are most profitable for a life of goodness to those who would pursue a godly and righteous course, we have <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a> <a name="xii.iv.lxii-Page_248"></a>written to you, men and brethren, at sufficient length.  For concerning faith and repentance and true love and continence and soberness and patience, we have touched upon every passage, putting you in mind that you ought in righteousness and truth and long-suffering to be well-pleasing <a name="fr_4323"></a><a href="#fn_4323"><font size="1">4324</font></a>
