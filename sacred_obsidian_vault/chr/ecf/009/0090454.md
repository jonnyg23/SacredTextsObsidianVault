 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xiii-p2"></a>Moreover to the saying, “They that received the half-shekel came to Peter,” <a name="fr_5913"></a><a href="#fn_5913"><font size="1">5914</font></a>
  you will adduce from Numbers that, for the saints according to the law of God, is paid not a half-shekel simply, but a sacred half-shekel.  For it is written, “And thou shalt take five shekels per head, according to the sacred half-shekel.” <a name="fr_5914"></a><a href="#fn_5914"><font size="1">5915</font></a>
   But also on behalf of all the sons of Israel is given a sacred half-shekel per head.  Since then it was not possible for the saint of God to possess along with the sacred half-shekels the profane shekels, so to speak, on this account, to them who do not receive the sacred half-shekels, and who asked Peter and said, “Doth not your master pay the half-shekel?” the Saviour commands the stater to be paid, in which was the half-shekel which was found in the mouth of the first fish that came up, in order that it might be given for the Teacher and the disciple.</p>
