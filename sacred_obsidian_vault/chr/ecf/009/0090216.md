 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xx-p2"></a>There is also an arche in a matter of learning, as when we say that the letters are the arche of grammar.  The Apostle accordingly says: <a name="fr_4541"></a><a href="#fn_4541"><font size="1">4542</font></a>
   “When by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again that some one teach you what are the elements of the arche of the oracles of God.”  Now the arche spoken of in connection with learning is twofold; first in respect of its nature, secondly in its relation to us; as we might say of Christ, that by nature His arche is deity, but that in relation to us who cannot, for its very greatness, command the whole truth about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached to babes, “Jesus Christ and Him crucified.”  In this view, then, Christ is the arche of learning in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and power of God; but for us, the Word was made flesh, that He might tabernacle among us who could only thus at first receive Him.  And perhaps this is the reason why He is not only the firstborn of all creation, but is also designated the man, Adam.  For Paul says He is Adam: <a name="fr_4542"></a><a href="#fn_4542"><font size="1">4543</font></a>
   “The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit.”</p>
