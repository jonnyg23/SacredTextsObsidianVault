 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.iii-p2"></a>“<i>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling to Him and saying, Lord, have mercy upon my son.</i>” <a name="fr_5861"></a><a href="#fn_5861"><font size="1">5862</font></a>
   Those who are suffering, or the kinsfolk of the sufferers, are along with the multitudes; wherefore, when He has dispensed the things that were beyond the multitudes, He descends to them, so that those, who were not able to ascend because of the sicknesses that repressed their soul, might be benefited when the Word descended to them from the loftier regions.  But we ought to make inquiry, in respect of what diseases the sufferers believe and pray for their own healing, and in respect of what diseases others do this for them, as, for example, the centurion for his servant, and the nobleman for his son, and the ruler of the synagogue for a daughter, and the Canaanitish woman for her female child who was vexed with a demon, and now the man who kneels to Him on behalf of his epileptic son.  And along with these you will investigate when the Saviour heals of Himself and unasked by any one, as for example, the paralytic; for these cures, when compared with one another for this very purpose, and examined together, will exhibit to him who is able to hear “the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery,” <a name="fr_5862"></a><a href="#fn_5862"><font size="1">5863</font></a>
  many dogmas concerning the different diseases of souls, as well as the method of their healing.</p>
