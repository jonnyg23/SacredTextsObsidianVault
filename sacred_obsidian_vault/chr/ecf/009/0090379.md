 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p1.1"></a>2.  Exposition of the Details of the Miracle.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.ii-p2"></a>Jesus, then, because of the power which He gave to the disciples, even the power of nourishing others, said, Give ye them to eat. <a name="fr_5343"></a><a href="#fn_5343"><font size="1">5344</font></a>
   But (not denying that they can give loaves, but thinking that there were much too few and not sufficient to feed those who followed Jesus, and not considering that when Jesus takes each loaf—the Word—He extends it as far as He wills, and makes it suffice for all whomsoever He desires to nourish), the disciples say, We have here but five loaves and two fishes. <a name="fr_5344"></a><a href="#fn_5344"><font size="1">5345</font></a>
   Perhaps by the five loaves they meant to make a veiled reference to the sensible words of the Scriptures, corresponding in number on this account to the five senses, but by the two fishes either to the word expressed <a name="fr_5345"></a><a href="#fn_5345"><font size="1">5346</font></a>
  and the word conceived, <a name="fr_5346"></a><a href="#fn_5346"><font size="1">5347</font></a>
  which are a relish, so to speak, to the sensible things contained in the Scriptures; <a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 432</font></a> <a name="xvi.ii.iv.ii-Page_432"></a>or, perhaps, to the word which had come to them about the Father and the Son.  Wherefore also after His resurrection He ate of a broiled fish, <a name="fr_5347"></a><a href="#fn_5347"><font size="1">5348</font></a>
  having taken a part from the disciples, and having received that theology about the Father which they were in part able to declare to Him.  Such is the contribution we have been able to give to the exposition of the word about the five loaves and the two fishes; and probably those, who are better able than we to gather together the five loaves and the two fishes among themselves, would be able to give a fuller and better interpretation of their meaning.  It must be observed, however, that while in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, <a name="fr_5348"></a><a href="#fn_5348"><font size="1">5349</font></a>
  the disciples say that they have the five loaves and the two fishes, without indicating whether they were wheaten or of barley, John alone says, that the loaves were barley loaves. <a name="fr_5349"></a><a href="#fn_5349"><font size="1">5350</font></a>
   Wherefore, perhaps, in the Gospel of John the disciples do not acknowledge that the loaves are with them, but say in John, “There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fishes.” <a name="fr_5350"></a><a href="#fn_5350"><font size="1">5351</font></a>
   And so long as these five loaves and two fishes were not carried by the disciples of Jesus, they did not increase or multiply, nor were they able to nourish more; but, when the Saviour took them, and in the first placed looked up to heaven, with the rays of His eyes, as it were, drawing down from it power which was to be mingled with the loaves and the fishes which were about to feed the five thousand; and after this blessed the five loaves and the two fishes, increasing and multiplying them by the word and the blessing; and in the third place dividing and breaking He gave to the disciples that they might set them before the multitudes, then the loaves and the fishes were sufficient, so that all ate and were satisfied, and some portions of the loaves which had been blessed they were unable to eat.  For so much remained over to the multitudes, which was not according to the capacity of the multitudes but of the disciples who were able to take up that which remained over of the broken pieces, and to place it in baskets filled with that which remained over, which were in number so many as the tribes of Israel.  Concerning Joseph, then, it is written in the Psalms, “His hands served in the basket,” <a name="fr_5351"></a><a href="#fn_5351"><font size="1">5352</font></a>
  but about the disciples of Jesus that they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces twelve baskets, twelve baskets, I take it, not half-full but filled.  And there are, I think, up to the present time, and will be until the consummation of the age with the disciples of Jesus, who are superior to the multitudes, the twelve baskets, filled with the broken pieces of living bread which the multitudes cannot eat.  Now those who ate of the five loaves which existed before the twelve baskets that remained over, were kindred in nature to the number five; for those who ate had reached the stage of sensible things, since also they were nourished by Him who looked up to heaven and blessed and brake them, and were not boys nor women, but men.  For there are, I think, even in sensible foods differences, so that some of them belong to those who “have put away childish things,” <a name="fr_5352"></a><a href="#fn_5352"><font size="1">5353</font></a>
  and some to those who are still babes and carnal in Christ.</p>
