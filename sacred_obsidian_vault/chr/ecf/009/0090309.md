 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2"></a>Now we find the lamb offered in the continual (daily) sacrifice.  Thus it is written, <a name="fr_4958"></a><a href="#fn_4958"><font size="1">4959</font></a>
  “This is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually, for a continual sacrifice.  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, the fourth part of a hin; and for a drink-offering the fourth part of a bin of wine to the first lamb.  And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening, according to the first sacrifice and according to its drink-offering.  Thou shalt offer a sweet savour, an offering to the Lord, a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of tent of witness before the Lord, where I will make myself known to thee, to speak unto thee.  And I will appoint thee for the children of Israel, and I will be sanctified in my glory, and with sanctification I will sanctify the tent of witness.”  But what other continual sacrifice can there be to the man of reason in the world of mind, but the Word growing to maturity, the Word who is symbolically called a lamb and who is offered as soon as the soul receives illumination.  This would be the continual sacrifice of the morning, and it is offered again when the sojourn of the mind with divine things comes to an end.  For it cannot maintain for ever its inter<a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 377</font></a> <a name="xv.iii.v.xxxiii-Page_377"></a>course with higher things, seeing that the soul is appointed to be yoked together with the body which is of earth and heavy.</p>
