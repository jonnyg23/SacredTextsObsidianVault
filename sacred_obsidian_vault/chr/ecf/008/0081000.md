 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xxix-p2"></a>Then Peter answered, “The prophet of the truth has said, Good things must needs come, and blessed, said he, is he by whom they come; in like manner evil things must needs come, but woe to him through whom they come. <a name="fr_1149"></a><a href="#fn_1149"><font size="1">1150</font></a>
   But if evil things come by means of evil men, and good things are brought by good men, it must needs be in each man as his own to be either good or bad, and proceeding from what he has proposed, in order to the coming of the subsequent good or evil, <a name="fr_1150"></a><a href="#fn_1150"><font size="1">1151</font></a>
  which, being of his own choice, are not arranged by the providence of God to come from him.  This being so, this is the judgment of God, that he who, as by a combat, comes through all misfortune and is found blameless, he is deemed worthy of eternal life; for those who by their own will continue in goodness, are tempted by those who continue in evil by their own will, being persecuted, hated, slandered, plotted against, struck, cheated, accused, tortured, disgraced,—suffering all these things by which it seems reasonable that they should be enraged and stirred up to vengeance.</p>
