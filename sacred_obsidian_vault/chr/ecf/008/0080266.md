 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lvi-p2"></a>At this announcement all the people wept, hearing that he was going to leave them; and Peter, sympathizing with them, himself also shed tears; and looking up to heaven, he said:  “To Thee, O God, who hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, we pour out the prayer of supplication, that Thou wouldest comfort those who have recourse to Thee in their tribulation.  For by reason of the affection that they have towards Thee, they do love me who have declared to them Thy truth.  Wherefore guard them with the right hand of Thy compassion; for neither Zacchæus nor any other man can be a sufficient guardian to them.”  When he had said this, and more to the same effect, he laid his hands upon Zacchæus, and prayed that he might blamelessly discharge the duty of his bishopric.  Then he ordained twelve presbyters and four deacons, and said:  “I have <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.v.lvi-Page_132"></a>ordained you this Zacchæus as a bishop, knowing that he has the fear of God, and is expert in the Scriptures.  You ought therefore to honour him as holding the place of Christ, obeying him for your salvation, and knowing that whatever honour and whatever injury is done to him, redounds to Christ, and from Christ to God.  Hear him therefore with all attention, and receive from him the doctrine of the faith; and from the presbyters the monitions of life; and from the deacons the order of discipline.  Have a religious care of widows; vigorously assist orphans; take pity on the poor; teach the young modesty;—and in a word, sustain one another as circumstances shall demand; worship God, who created heaven and earth; believe in Christ; love one another; be compassionate to all; and fulfil charity not only in word, but in act and deed.”</p>
