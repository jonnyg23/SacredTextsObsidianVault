 <p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.vii-p3"></a>Answer to Abgars letter, which the apostle Thomas wrote to this prince by command of the Saviour.</p> 
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.vii-p4"></a>“Blessed is he who believes in me without having seen me!  For it is written of me:  Those who see me will not believe in me, and those who do not see me will believe and live.  As to what thou hast written asking me to come to thee, I must accomplish here all that for which I have been sent; and, when I shall have accomplished it all, I shall ascend to Him who sent me; and when I shall go away I will send one of my disciples, who will cure thy diseases, and give life to thee and to all those who are with thee.”  Anan, Abgars courier, brought him this letter, as well as the portrait of the Saviour, a picture which is still to be found at this day in the city of Edessa.</p>
