 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lx-p2"></a>Therefore, on the day appointed, when they had ranged themselves before Peter, they said:  “Do not think, O Peter, that it is a small grief to us that we are to be deprived of the privilege of hearing you for three months; but since it is <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.v.lx-Page_133"></a>good for us to do what you order, we shall most readily obey.  We shall always retain in our hearts the remembrance of your face; and so we set out actively, as you have commanded us.”  Then he, having poured out a prayer to the Lord for them, dismissed them.  And when those twelve who had been sent forward had gone, Peter entered, according to custom, and stood in the place of disputation.  And a multitude of people had come together, even a larger number than usual; and all with tears gazed upon him, by reason of what they had heard from him the day before, that he was about to go forth on account of Simon.  Then, seeing them weeping, he himself also was similarly affected, although he endeavoured to conceal and to restrain his tears.  But the trembling of his voice, and the interruption of his discourse, betrayed that he was distressed by similar emotion.</p>
