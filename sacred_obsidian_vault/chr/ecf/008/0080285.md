 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.ix-p2"></a>“When God had made man after His own image and likeness, He grafted into His work a certain breathing and odour of His divinity, that so men, being made partakers of His Only-begotten, might through Him be also friends of God and sons of adoption.  Whence also He Himself, as the true Prophet, knowing with what actions the Father is pleased, instructed them in what way they might obtain that privilege.  At that time, therefore, there was among men only one worship of God—a pure mind and an uncorrupted spirit.  And for this reason every creature kept an inviolable covenant with the human race.  For by reason of their reverence of the Creator, no sickness, or bodily disorder, or corruption of food, had power over them; <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.vi.ix-Page_137"></a>whence it came to pass, that a life of a thousand years did not fall into the frailty of old age.</p>
