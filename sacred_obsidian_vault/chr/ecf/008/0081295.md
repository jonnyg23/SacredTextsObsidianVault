 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiv.vii-p2"></a>And Hades receiving Satan, said to him:  Beelzebul, heir of fire and punishment, enemy of the saints, through what necessity didst thou bring about that the King of glory should be crucified, so that he should come here and deprive us <i>of our power?</i>  Turn and see that not one of the dead has been left in me, but all that thou hast gained through the tree of knowledge, all hast thou lost through the tree of the cross:  and all thy joy has been turned into grief; and wishing to put to death the King of glory, thou hast put thyself to death.  For, since I have received thee to keep thee safe, by experience shalt thou learn how many evils I shall do unto thee.  O arch-devil, the beginning of death, root of sin, end of all evil, what evil didst thou find in Jesus, that thou shouldst compass his destruction? how hast thou dared to do such evil? how hast thou busied thyself to bring down such a man into this darkness, through whom thou hast been deprived of all who have died from eternity?</p>
