 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xx-p2"></a>And, at the same time, he satisfied me by expounding to me who He is, and how He is found, and holding Him forth to me as truly to be found, showing that the truth is more manifest to the ear by the discourse of the prophet than things that are seen with the eye; so that I was astonished, and wondered that no one sees those things which are sought after by all, though they lie before him.  However, having written this discourse concerning the Prophet by his order, he caused the volume to be despatched to you from Cæsarea Stratonis, saying that he had a charge from you to send his discourses and his acts year by year. <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">915</font></a>
   Thus, on the very first day, beginning only concerning the prophet of the truth, he confirmed me in every respect; and then he spoke thus:  “Henceforth give heed to the discussions that take place between me and those on the other side; and even if I come off at a disadvantage, I am not afraid of your ever doubting of the truth that has been delivered to you, knowing well that I seem to be beaten, but not the doctrine that has been delivered to us by the Prophet.  However, I hope not to come off in our inquiries at a disadvantage with men who have understanding—I mean lovers of truth, who are able to know what discourses are specious, artificial, and pleasant, and what are unartificial and simple, trusting only to the truth <i>that is conveyed</i> through them.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xx-p3"></a> The text is probably corrupt or defective.  As it stands, grammatically Peter writes the discourse and sends it, and yet “by his order” must also apply to Peter.  The <i>Recognitions</i> make Clement write the book and send it.  The passage is deemed important, and is accordingly discussed in Schliemann, p. 83; Hilgenfeld, p. 37; and Uhlhorn, p. 101.  [See <i>Recognitions</i>, i. 17.  Both passages, despite the variation, may be urged in support of the existence of an earlier document as the common basis of the Clementine literature.—R.]</p>
