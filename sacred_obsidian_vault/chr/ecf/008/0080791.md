 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.iv-p2"></a>“Whence, if you also suffer any such thing after the manner of men, use freedom with me with all security; for within seven days I shall put you fully in possession of her.  When I heard this, looking at the object I had in view, I said:  Pardon me that I do not altogether believe in the existence of magic; for I have already tried many who have made many promises, and have deceived me.  However, your undertaking influences me, and leads me to hope.  But when I think of the matter, I am afraid that the demons are sometimes not subject to the magicians with respect to the things that are commanded them.</p>
