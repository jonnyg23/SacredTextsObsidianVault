 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2"></a>“Although this word <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></a>God</span> is not the <i>name</i> of God, but meantime that word is employed by men as His name; and therefore, as I have said, when it is used reproachfully, the reproach is referred to the injury of the true name.  In short, the ancient Egyptians, who thought that they had discovered the theory of the heavenly revolutions and the nature of the stars, nevertheless, through the demons blocking up their senses, subjected the incommunicable name to all kinds of indignity.  For some taught that their ox, which is called Apis, ought to be worshipped; others taught that the he-goat, others that cats, the ibis, a fish also, a serpent, onions, drains, crepitus ventris, ought to be regarded as deities, and innumerable other things, which I am ashamed even to mention.”</p>
