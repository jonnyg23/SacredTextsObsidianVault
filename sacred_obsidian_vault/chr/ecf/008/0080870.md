  the angels who dwell in the lowest region, being grieved at the ingratitude of men to God, asked that they might come into the life of men, that, really becoming men, by more intercourse they might convict those who had acted ungratefully towards Him, and might subject every one to adequate punishment.  When, therefore, their petition was granted, they metamorphosed themselves into every nature; for, being of a more godlike substance, they are able easily to assume any form.  So they became precious stones, and goodly pearl, and the most beauteous purple, and choice gold, and all matter that is held in most esteem.  And they fell into the hands of some, and into the bosoms of others, and suffered themselves to be stolen by them.  They also changed themselves into beasts and reptiles, and fishes and birds, and into whatsoever they pleased.  These things also the poets among yourselves, by reason of fearlessness, sing, as they befell, attributing to one the many and diverse doings of all.</p>
