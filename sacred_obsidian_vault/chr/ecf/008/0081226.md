 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.v-p2"></a>Therefore, as the angel had commanded, both of them setting out from the place where they were, went up to Jerusalem; and when they had come to the place pointed out by the angels prophecy, there they met each other.  Then, rejoicing at seeing each other, and secure in the certainty of the promised offspring, they gave the thanks due to the Lord, who exalteth the humble.  And so, having worshipped the Lord, they returned home, and awaited in certainty and in gladness the divine promise.  Anna therefore conceived, and brought forth a daughter; and according to the command of the angel, her parents called her name Mary.</p>
