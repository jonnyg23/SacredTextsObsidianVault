 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xvi-p2"></a>But when I was about to speak, Niceta, biting his lip, beckoned to me to be silent.  And when Peter saw him, he said:  “Why would you repress his liberal disposition and noble nature, that you would have him be silent for my honour, which is nothing?  Or do you not know, that if all nations, after they have heard from me the preaching of the truth, and have believed, would betake themselves to teaching, they would gain the greater glory for me, if indeed you think me desirous of glory?  For what so glorious as to prepare disciples for Christ, not who shall be silent, and shall be saved alone, but who shall speak what they have learned, and shall do good to others?  I wish indeed that both you, Niceta, and you, beloved Aquila, would aid me in preaching the word of God, and the rather because those things in which the Gentiles err are well known to you; and not you only, but all who hear me, I wish, as I have said, so to hear and to learn, that they may be able also to teach:  for the world needs many helpers, by whom men may be recalled <a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.xvi-Page_197"></a>from error.”  When he had spoken thus, he said to me:  “Go on then, Clement, with what you have begun.”</p>
