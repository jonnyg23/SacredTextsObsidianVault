 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.xii-p2"></a>And Joseph, seeing that He had such favour, and that He was increasing in stature, thought it right to take Him to learn His letters.  And he handed Him over to another teacher to be taught.  And that teacher said to Joseph:  What letters dost thou wish me to teach that boy?  Joseph answered and said:  First teach him the Gentile letters, and then the Hebrew.  For the teacher knew that He was very intelligent, and willingly took Him in hand.  And writing for Him the first line, which is A and B, he taught Him for some hours. <a name="fr_1771"></a><a href="#fn_1771"><font size="1">1772</font></a>
   But Jesus was silent, and made him no answer.  Jesus said to the master:  If thou art indeed a master, and if thou indeed knowest the letters, tell me the power <a name="fr_1772"></a><a href="#fn_1772"><font size="1">1773</font></a>
  of the A, and I shall tell thee the power of the B.  Then His master was filled with fury, and struck Him on the head.  And Jesus was angry, and cursed him; and he suddenly fell down, and died.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.xii-p5"></a>And Jesus returned home.  And Joseph gave orders to Mary His mother, not to let Him go out of the court of his house.</p>
