 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xi-p2"></a>“Whence it must before all things be known, that nowhere can truth be found unless from a prophet of truth.  But He is a true Prophet, who always knows all things, and even the thoughts of all men, who is without sin, as being convinced respecting the judgment of God.  Wherefore we ought not simply to consider respecting His foreknowledge, but whether His foreknowledge can stand, apart from other cause.  For physicians predict certain things, having the pulse of the patient as matter submitted to them; and some predict by means of having fowls, and some by having sacrifices, and others by having many various matters submitted to them; yet these are not prophets.</p>
