 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xxxiv-p2"></a>“Nevertheless, as he had got these two sons during the time while he still lived in ignorance of things, having received the knowledge of God, he asked of the Righteous One that he might merit to have offspring by Sarah, who was his lawful wife, though she was barren.  She obtained a son. whom he named Isaac, from whom came Jacob, and from him the twelve patriarchs, and from these twelve seventy-two.  These, when famine befell came into Egypt with all their family; and in the course of four hundred years, being multiplied by the blessing and promise of God, they were afflicted by the Egyptians.  And when they were afflicted the true Prophet appeared to Moses, <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">556</font></a>
  and struck the Egyptians with ten plagues, when they refused to let the Hebrew people depart from them, and return to their native land; and he brought the people of God out of Egypt.  But those of the Egyptians who survived the plagues, being infected with the animosity of their king, pursued after the Hebrews.  And when they had overtaken them at the sea-shore, and thought to destroy and exterminate them all, Moses, pouring out prayer to God, divided the sea into two parts, so that the water was held on the right hand and on the left as if it had been frozen, and the people of God passed as over a dry road; but the Egyptians who were pursuing them, rashly entering, were drowned.  For when the last of the Hebrews came out, the last of the Egyptians went down into the sea; and straight<a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xxxiv-Page_87"></a>way the waters of the sea, which by his command were held bound as with frost, were loosed by his command who had bound them, and recovering their natural freedom, inflicted punishment on the wicked nation.</p>
