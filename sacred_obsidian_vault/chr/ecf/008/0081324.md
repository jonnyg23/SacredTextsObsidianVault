 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p2"></a>When this was seen by Hades and Death, and their impious officers, along with their cruel servants, they trembled at perceiving in their own dominions the clearness of so great a light, when they saw Christ suddenly in their abodes; and they cried out, saying:  We have been overcome by thee.  Who art thou, that to the Lord directest our confusion? <a name="fr_1985"></a><a href="#fn_1985"><font size="1">1986</font></a>
   Who art thou, that, undestroyed by corruption, the uncorrupted proof of thy majesty, with fury condemnest our power?  Who art thou, so great and little, lowly and exalted, soldier and commander, wonderful warrior in the form of a slave, and the king of glory dead and alive, whom slain the cross has carried?  Thou, who didst lie dead in the sepulchre, hast come down to us alive; and in thy death every creature trembled, and the stars in a body were moved; and now thou hast been made free among the dead, and disturbest our legions.  Who art thou, that settest free those who art held captive, bound by original sin, and recallest them to their former liberty?  Who art thou, who sheddest a divine, and splendid, and illuminating light upon those who have been blinded by the darkness of their sins?</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p4"></a>In like manner, also, all the legions of the demons, terror-stricken with like fear from their fearful overthrow, cried out, saying:  Whence art thou, O Jesus, a man so powerful and splendid in majesty, so excellent, without spot, and free from guilt?  For that world of earth which has been subject to us always until now, which used to pay tribute for our uses, has never sent us such a dead man, has never destined such gifts for the powers below.  Who therefore art thou, that hast <a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 451</font></a> <a name="vii.xvi.vi-Page_451"></a>so intrepidly entered our bounds, and who hast not only no fear of our punishments, but, moreover, attemptest to take all away from our chains?  Perhaps thou art that Jesus of whom our prince Satan said, that by thy death of the cross thou wast destined to receive the dominion of the whole world.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p5"></a>Then the King of glory, trampling on death by His majesty, and seizing Prince Satan, delivered him to the power of Hades, and drew Adam to His brightness.</p>
