 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xlvi-p2"></a>“Let no one therefore put off.  Let no one delay.  For what occasion is there for delaying to do well?  Or are you afraid, lest, when you have done well, you do not find the reward as you supposed?  And what loss will you sustain if you do well without reward?  Would not conscience alone be sufficient in this?  But if you find as you anticipate, shall you not receive great things for small, and eternal for temporal?  But I say this for the sake of the unbelieving.  For the things which we preach are as we preach them; because they cannot be otherwise, since they have been promised by the prophetic word.</p>
