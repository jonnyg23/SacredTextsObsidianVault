 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.ix-p2"></a>And the Lord, holding the hand of Adam, delivered him to Michael the archangel:  and all the saints followed Michael the archangel, and he led them all into the glorious grace of paradise.  And there met them two men, ancient of days.  The saints asked them:  Who are you, that have not yet been dead, along with us in the regions below, and have been placed in paradise in the body?  One of them answered, and said:  I am Enoch, who by the word of the Lord have been translated hither; and he who is with me is Elias the Thesbite, who was taken up by a fiery chariot.  Here also even until now we have not tasted death, but have been reserved to the coming of Antichrist, by divine signs and wonders to do battle with him, and, being killed by him in Jerusalem, after three days and half a day to be taken up alive again in the clouds. <a name="fr_1994"></a><a href="#fn_1994"><font size="1">1995</font></a>
