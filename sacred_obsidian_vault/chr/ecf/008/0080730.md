 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xliii-p2"></a>“But if Adam, being the work of God, had foreknowledge, much more the God who created him.  And that is false which is written that God reflected, as if using reasoning on account of ignorance; and that the Lord tempted Abraham, that He might know if he would endure it; and that which is written, Let us go down, and see if they are doing according to the cry of them which cometh to me; and if not, that I may know.  And, not to extend my discourse too far, whatever sayings ascribe ignorance to Him, or anything else that is evil, being upset by other sayings which affirm the contrary, are proved to be false.  But because He does indeed foreknow, He says to Abraham, Thou shalt assuredly know that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not their own; and they shall enslave them, and shall evil entreat them, and humble them four hundred years.  But the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, and after that they shall come out hither with much property; but thou shalt depart to thy fathers with peace, being nourished in a good old age; and in the fourth generation they shall return hither, for the sins of the Amorites are hitherto not filled up. <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">987</font></a>
