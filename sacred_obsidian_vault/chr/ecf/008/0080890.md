  by reason of the evil intelligence of the magicians, who found excuses for them, which had power to constrain them to the foolish worship.  For, establishing this things by magical ceremonies, they assigned them feasts from sacrifices, libations, flutes, and shoutings, by means of which senseless men, being deceived, and their kingdom being taken from them, yet did not desist from the worship that they had taken up with.  To such an extent did they prefer error, on account of its pleasantness, before truth.  They also howl after their sacrificial surfeit, their soul from the depth, as it were by dreams, forewarning them of the punishment that is to befall such deeds of theirs.</p>
