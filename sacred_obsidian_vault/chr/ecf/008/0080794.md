 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.vii-p2"></a>“Then Appion said:  Do you not think it is the same thing, whether you obtain her by magic, or by deceiving her with words?  Then said I:  Not altogether the same; for these differ widely from one another.  For he who constrains an unwilling woman by the force of magic, subjects himself to the most terrible punishment, as having plotted against a chaste woman; but he who persuades her with words, and puts the choice in her own power and will, does not force her.  And I am of opinion, that he who has persuaded <i>a woman</i> will not suffer so great punishment as he who has forced her.  Therefore, if you can persuade her, I shall be thankful to you when I have obtained her; but otherwise, I had rather die than force her against her will.</p>
