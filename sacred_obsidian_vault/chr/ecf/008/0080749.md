 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxii-p2"></a>“But, further, let the things that are happening before your eyes persuade you; how wars are constantly arising through there being now many kings all over the earth.  For each one holds the government of another as a pretext for war.  But if one were universal superior, he, having no reason why he should make war, would have perpetual peace.  In short, therefore, to those who are thought worthy of eternal life, God appoints one universal King in the world that shall then be, that by means of monarchy there may be unfailing peace.  It behoves all, therefore, to follow some one as a leader, honouring him as the image of God; and it behoves the leader to be acquainted with the road that entereth into the holy city.</p>
