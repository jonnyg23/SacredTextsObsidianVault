 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxx-p2"></a>“Then Simon said:  I am aware that you know that I separated a soul from a human body; but I know that you are ignorant that it is not the soul of the dead person that ministers to me, for it does not exist; but a certain demon works, pretending to be the soul.  Then said Nicetas:  Many incredible things we have heard in our lifetime, but aught more senseless than this speech we do not expect ever to hear.  For if a demon pretends to be the soul of the dead person, what is the use of the soul at all, that it should be separated from the body?  Were not we ourselves present and heard you conjuring the soul from the body?  And how comes it that, when one is conjured, another who is not conjured obeys, as if it were frightened?  And you yourself, when at any time we have asked you why the conferences sometimes cease, did not you say that the soul, having fulfilled the time upon earth which it was to have passed in the body, goes to Hades?  And you added, that <a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.v.xxx-Page_235"></a>the souls of those who commit suicide are not easily permitted to come, because, having gone home into Hades, they are guarded.”</p>
