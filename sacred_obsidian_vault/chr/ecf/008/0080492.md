 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxiii-p2"></a>“But, further, in Susæ the women use ointments, and indeed of the best sort, being decked with ornaments and precious stones; also they go abroad supported by the aid of their maidservants, with much greater ambition than the men.  They do not, however, cultivate modesty, but have intercourse indifferently with whomsoever they please, with slaves and guests, such liberty being allowed them by their husbands; and not only are they not blamed for this, but they also rule over their husbands.  And yet the <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span> of all the Susian women has not Venus, with Jupiter and Mars in the middle of the heaven in the houses of Jupiter.  In the remoter parts of the East, if a boy be treated unnaturally, when it is discovered, he is killed by his brothers, or his parents, or any of his relations, and is left unburied.  And again, among the Gauls, an old law allows boys to be thus treated publicly; and no disgrace is thought to attach to it.  And is it possible, that all those who are so basely treated among the Gauls, have had Lucifer with Mercury in the houses of Saturn and the confines of Mars?</p>
