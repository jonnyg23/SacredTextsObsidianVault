 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xxxvii-p2"></a>But on the following day Peter arose early and called us, and we went together to the secret place in which we had been on the previous day, for the purpose of prayer.  And when, after prayer, we were coming thence to the appointed place, he exhorted us by the way, saying: <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">819</font></a>
   “Hear me, most beloved fellow-servants:  It is good that every one of you, according to his ability, contribute to the advantage of those who are approaching to the faith of our religion; and therefore do not shrink from instructing the ignorant, and teaching according to the wisdom which has been bestowed upon you by the providence of God, yet so that you only join the eloquence of your discourse with those things which you have heard from me, and which have been committed to you.  But do not speak anything which is your own, and which has not been committed to you, though it may seem to yourselves to be true; but hold forth those things, as I have said, which I myself have received from the true Prophet, and have delivered to you, although they may seem to be less full of authority.  For thus it often happens that men turn away from the truth, while they believe that they have found out, by their own thoughts, a form of truth more true and powerful.”</p>
