 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.xi-p2"></a>And Jesus reached the age of eight years.  Joseph was a master builder, <a name="fr_1769"></a><a href="#fn_1769"><font size="1">1770</font></a>
  and used to make ploughs and ox-yokes.  And one day a rich man <a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a> <a name="vii.x.xi-Page_403"></a>said to Joseph:  Master, make me a couch, both useful and beautiful.  And Joseph was in distress, because the wood which he had brought <a name="fr_1770"></a><a href="#fn_1770"><font size="1">1771</font></a>
  for the work was too short.  And Jesus said to him:  Do not be annoyed.  Take hold of this piece of wood by one end, and I by the other; I and let us draw it out.  And they did so; and immediately he found it useful for that which he wished.  And He said to Joseph:  Behold, do the work which thou wishest.  And Joseph, seeing what He had done, embraced Him, and said:  Blessed am I, because God hath given me such a son.</p>
