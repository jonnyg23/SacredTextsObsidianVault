 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.ii-p2"></a>“I know, indeed, that you are distressed at being told to do this, being separated from me by a space of two days.  I would have you know, therefore, that we the persuaders love you the persuaded much more than you love us who have persuaded you.  Therefore loving one another as we do by not unreasonably doing what we wish, let us provide, as much as in us lies, for safety.  For I prefer, as you also know, to go into the more notable cities of the provinces, and to remain some days, and discourse.  And for the present lead the way into the neighbouring Laodicea, and, after two or three days, so far as it depends upon my choice, I shall overtake you.  And do you alone receive me at the gates, on account of the confusion, that thus we may enter along with you without tumult.  And thence, in like manner, after some days stay, others in your stead will go forward by turns to the places beyond, preparing lodgings for us.”</p>
