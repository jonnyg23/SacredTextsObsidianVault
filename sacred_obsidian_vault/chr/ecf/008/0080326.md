 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xii-p2"></a>“But this happened by the providence of God, that the knowledge of this good One should be handed over to the Gentiles, and those who had never heard of Him, nor had learned from the prophets, should acknowledge Him, while those who had acknowledged Him in their daily meditations should not know Him.  For, behold, by you who are now present, and desire to hear the doctrine of His faith, and to know what, and how, and of what sort is His coming, the prophetic truth is fulfilled.  For this is what the prophets foretold, that He is to be sought for by you, who never heard of Him. <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">757</font></a>
   And, therefore, seeing that the prophetic sayings are fulfilled even in yourselves, you rightly believe in Him alone, you rightly wait for Him, you rightly inquire concerning Him, that you not only may wait for Him, but also believing, you may obtain the inheritance of His kingdom; <a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.vii.xii-Page_146"></a>according to what Himself said, that every one is made the servant of him to whom he yields subjection. <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">758</font></a>
