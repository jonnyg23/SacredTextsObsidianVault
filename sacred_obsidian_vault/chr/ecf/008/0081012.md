 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p2"></a>And Nicetas, who in future is to be called Faustinus, began to speak.  “On that very night when, as you know, the ship went to pieces, we were taken up by some men, who did not fear to follow the profession of robbers on the deep.  They placed us in a boat, and brought us along the coast, sometimes rowing and sometimes sending for provisions, and at length took us to Cæsarea Stratonis, <a name="fr_1165"></a><a href="#fn_1165"><font size="1">1166</font></a>
  and there tormented us by hunger, fear, and blows, that we might not recklessly disclose anything which they did not wish us to tell; and, moreover, changing our names, they succeeded in selling us.  Now the woman who bought us was a proselyte of the Jews, an altogether worthy person, of the name of Justa.  She adopted us as her own children, and zealously brought us up in all the learning of the Greeks.  But we, becoming discreet with our years, were strongly attached to her religion, and we paid good heed to our culture, in order that, disputing with the other nations, we might be able to convince them of their error.  We also made an accurate study of the doctrines of the philosophers, especially the most atheistic,—I mean those of Epicurus and Pyrrho,—in order that we might be the better able to refute them. <a name="fr_1166"></a><a href="#fn_1166"><font size="1">1167</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p3"></a> This clause, literally translated, is, “and sometimes impelling it with oars, they brought us along the land; and sometimes sending for provisions, they conveyed us to Cæsarea Stratonis.”  The Latin translator renders “to land,” not “along the land.”  The passage assumes a different form in the <i>Recognitions</i>, the first <i>Epitome</i>, and the second <i>Epitome</i>; and there is, no doubt, some corruption in the text.  The text has <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p3.1"></a>δακρύοντας</span>, which makes no sense.  We have adopted the rendering given in the <i>Recognitions</i>.  Various attempts have been made to amend the word.</p>
