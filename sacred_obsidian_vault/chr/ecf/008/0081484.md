 </p><p class="c15"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p1"></a> <span class="c6"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p1.1"></a>A Homily on Guria and Shamuna, Composed by Mar Jacob.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p2"></a><span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p2.1"></a>Shamuna</span> and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p3"></a>Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p4"></a>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p5"></a>That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p6"></a>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p7"></a>Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:—</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p8"></a>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p9"></a>And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p10"></a>Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p11"></a>And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p12"></a>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p13"></a>By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p14"></a>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p15"></a>Of every <i>kind of</i> error, the lights were not put out;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p16"></a>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p17"></a>In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p18"></a>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p19"></a>Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p20"></a>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p21"></a>And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p22"></a>Two precious pearls, which were</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p23"></a>An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aramæans son.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p24"></a>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p25"></a>And whose faith was known by their sufferings.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p26"></a>On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p27"></a>With <i>the marks of</i> combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p28"></a>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p29"></a>But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p30"></a>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p31"></a><a name="page_715"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 715</font></a> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_715"></a>Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up himself.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p32"></a>Fire and sword proved their love, how true <i>it was;</i></p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p33"></a>And more beautiful than silver tried in <i>a furnace of</i> earth were their necks.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p34"></a>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p35"></a>Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p36"></a>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p37"></a>And they were enlightened by it, and with <i>His</i> light chased they away the darkness.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p38"></a>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p39"></a>Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p40"></a>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p41"></a>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p42"></a>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably: <a name="fr_3327"></a><a href="#fn_3327"><font size="1">3328</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p44"></a>And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword, <a name="fr_3328"></a><a href="#fn_3328"><font size="1">3329</font></a>
  all athirst as it was for blood.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p46"></a>With guilelessness and <i>yet with</i> wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p47"></a>As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p48"></a>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p49"></a>Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by them.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p50"></a><i>Nor guileless only:</i>  for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents <i>too</i></p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p51"></a>They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p52"></a>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p53"></a>But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p54"></a>And, so long as his head is kept <i>from harm</i>, his life abideth in him;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p55"></a>But, if the head be struck, his life is left <i>a prey</i> to destruction.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p56"></a>The head of the soul is mens faith;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p57"></a>And, if this be preserved <i>unharmed</i>, by it is also preserved their life: <a name="fr_3329"></a><a href="#fn_3329"><font size="1">3330</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p59"></a>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p60"></a><i>Yet</i>, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p61"></a>But, if faith is struck <i>down</i> by unbelief,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p62"></a>Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p63"></a>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men <a name="fr_3330"></a><a href="#fn_3330"><font size="1">3331</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p65"></a>Were heedful, that it should not be struck <i>down</i> by persecutors:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p66"></a>For they knew that, if faith is preserved,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p67"></a>Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p68"></a>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p69"></a>That that should not be struck <i>down</i> in which their very life was hidden.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p70"></a>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation, <a name="fr_3331"></a><a href="#fn_3331"><font size="1">3332</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p72"></a>Yea to every <i>kind of</i> torture, that their faith should not be stricken <i>down;</i></p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p73"></a>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p74"></a>So hid they their faith within their hearts;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p75"></a>And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p76"></a>But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p77"></a>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p78"></a>And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p79"></a>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p80"></a>Denying <i>a man</i> dies, confessing he lives, and <i>the mouth</i> hath power over it.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p81"></a>Denial is death, and in confession is the souls life;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p82"></a>And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p83"></a>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p84"></a>This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p85"></a>Even the robber by one word of faith</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p86"></a>Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise, <a name="fr_3332"></a><a href="#fn_3332"><font size="1">3333</font></a>
  all fraught with blessings.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p88"></a>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p89"></a>Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p90"></a>But, like true men holding fast the faith,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p91"></a>They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p92"></a>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to <i>tell of</i> thee?</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p93"></a>All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p94"></a>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p95"></a>And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy championship.</p> 
 <p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p96"></a><a name="page_716"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 716</font></a> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_716"></a>Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p97"></a>Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be stolen <i>from us</i>.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p98"></a>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p99"></a>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p100"></a>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p101"></a>And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p102"></a>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p103"></a>And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p104"></a>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so abounding;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p105"></a>And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are <i>so</i> severe upon thee.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p106"></a>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p107"></a>For lo! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p108"></a>Small thy village, poor thy country:  who, then, gave thee</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p109"></a>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p110"></a>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p111"></a>Take dust from thy threshold, as <i>though it were</i> the medicine of life.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p112"></a>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p113"></a>And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p114"></a>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p115"></a>Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you <i>supplies for</i> their wants.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p116"></a>The Son of God in poverty and want</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p117"></a>Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p118"></a><i>His disciples</i>, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p119"></a>All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p120"></a>One fisherman, whose “village” too was a home of fishermen, <a name="fr_3333"></a><a href="#fn_3333"><font size="1">3334</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p122"></a>He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house. <a name="fr_3334"></a><a href="#fn_3334"><font size="1">3335</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p124"></a>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p125"></a>He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p126"></a>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p127"></a>And lo! in a great city became they lords;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p128"></a>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p129"></a>And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p130"></a>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p131"></a>These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p132"></a>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p133"></a>And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p134"></a>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p135"></a>And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant men.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p136"></a>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted, <a name="fr_3335"></a><a href="#fn_3335"><font size="1">3336</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p138"></a>That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p139"></a>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p140"></a>But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p141"></a>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p142"></a>But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p143"></a>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p144"></a>But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p145"></a>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p146"></a>But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p147"></a>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p148"></a>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p149"></a>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p150"></a>Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p151"></a>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation, <a name="fr_3336"></a><a href="#fn_3336"><font size="1">3337</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p153"></a>How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p154"></a>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p155"></a>Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p156"></a>The judge menaced <i>them</i>, and multiplied his words of threatening;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p157"></a>And recounted tortures and all <i>kinds of</i> inflictions, that he might terrify them.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p158"></a>He spake great words, <a name="fr_3337"></a><a href="#fn_3337"><font size="1">3338</font></a>
  that by fright and intimidation,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p160"></a>By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p161"></a><a name="page_717"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 717</font></a> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_717"></a>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p162"></a>And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p163"></a>And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p164"></a>And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p165"></a>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p166"></a>And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p167"></a>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p168"></a>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p169"></a>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p170"></a>For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p171"></a>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p172"></a>The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his threats.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p173"></a>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p174"></a>And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p175"></a>By those things which he told <i>them</i> he tried to frighten them to sacrifice;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p176"></a>And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p177"></a>Truth is wiser than wise words,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p178"></a>And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is falsehood.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p179"></a>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking truth,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p180"></a>While the judge continued to utter falsehood.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p181"></a>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p182"></a>Because all his menaces against the truth were accounted <i>by them</i> as empty sound. <a name="fr_3338"></a><a href="#fn_3338"><font size="1">3339</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p184"></a>The intercourse of the world they despised, they contemned and scorned, <i>yea</i> they abandoned;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p185"></a>And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it <i>again</i>.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p186"></a>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p187"></a>To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p188"></a>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p189"></a>Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of evil.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p190"></a>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with God,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p191"></a>And to “that” country did they set their face to depart;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p192"></a>And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p193"></a>To let them pass over to God, for whom they were longing.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p194"></a>This world they accounted as a little tent,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p195"></a>But that yonder as a city full of beauties;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p196"></a>And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p197"></a>To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are worthy of it.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p198"></a>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p199"></a>And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p200"></a>A demons fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p201"></a>And embittered him against the stedfast ones, <i>inciting him</i> to crush them;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p202"></a>And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict them:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p203"></a>And they were a marvel to both sides, <i>when they saw</i> how much they endured.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p204"></a>At the old mens frame heaven and earth marvelled,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p205"></a><i>To see</i> how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under <i>their</i> affliction.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p206"></a>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p207"></a>Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or that murmurs.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p208"></a>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p209"></a><i>To see</i> how <i>calmly</i> the outstretched forms bore the inflictions <i>laid upon them</i>. <a name="fr_3339"></a><a href="#fn_3339"><font size="1">3340</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p211"></a>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless frames,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p212"></a><i>To see</i> what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p213"></a>Yea, and gladdened too were the angels by that fortitude <i>of theirs</i>,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p214"></a><i>To see</i> how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p215"></a>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p216"></a>There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p217"></a>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p218"></a>But the noble men <i>before him felt</i> no weariness in their afflictions.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p219"></a>He asked them whether they would consent to sacrifice;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p220"></a>But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p221"></a>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p222"></a>Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p223"></a><a name="page_718"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 718</font></a> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_718"></a>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p224"></a>But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with fortitude from itself.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p225"></a>Alas for the persecutors! how destitute were they of righteousness!</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p226"></a>But the children of light—how were they clad in faith!</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p227"></a>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p228"></a>Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p229"></a>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p230"></a>To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p231"></a>And what should the martyr do, who had no power to say,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p232"></a>When he was questioned, that he would not sacrifice?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p233"></a>All silent were the old men full of faith,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p234"></a>And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p235"></a>Yet questioned they were:  and in what way, if a man is silent</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p236"></a>When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p237"></a>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p238"></a>Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p239"></a>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p240"></a>The resolve of the new man that was within.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p241"></a>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p242"></a>That they were not going to sacrifice, and every one understood their meaning.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p243"></a>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p244"></a>But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p245"></a>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p246"></a>So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were <i>alike</i> stedfast.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p247"></a>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p248"></a>And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p249"></a>Who but must marvel <i>to see</i> that, when the will is watchful and ready,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p250"></a>It is very broad and full of light to him that goeth therein?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p251"></a>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p252"></a>And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p253"></a>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p254"></a>And on “Yea” and “Nay” stand <a name="fr_3340"></a><a href="#fn_3340"><font size="1">3341</font></a>
  sin and righteousness.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p256"></a>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not sacrifice,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p257"></a>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p258"></a>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p259"></a>Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p260"></a>Upwards they made a sign, <i>to signify</i> that upwards were they prepared to ascend;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p261"></a>And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p262"></a>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p263"></a>They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the kingdom.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p264"></a>Even while they were silent they were advocates for the Son of God:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p265"></a>For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p266"></a>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p267"></a>And as though with open mouth declared they <i>their</i> faith by signs;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p268"></a>And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p269"></a>And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p270"></a>And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spake not,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p271"></a>Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p272"></a>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p273"></a>And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p274"></a>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p275"></a>And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p276"></a><i>Yet</i> null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the judge,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p277"></a>And without speech the mute sign of the martyrs bore off the palm.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p278"></a>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p279"></a>And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p280"></a>And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p281"></a>The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p282"></a><a name="page_719"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 719</font></a> <a name="ix.xiv.ii-Page_719"></a>Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to the silent:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p283"></a>For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of faith.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p284"></a>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p285"></a>And they put them in bonds, threatening <i>yet</i> to vanquish them.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p286"></a>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p287"></a>Held of no account—yea <i>rather</i> as the light which has no end.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p288"></a><i>To be</i> without bread, and without water, and without light,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p289"></a>Pleased them well, because of the love of the Son of God.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p290"></a>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p291"></a>With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p292"></a>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he prayed</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p293"></a><i>In</i> prayer pure and strained clear by pain.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p294"></a>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p295"></a>And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p296"></a>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his faith;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p297"></a>Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his deed.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p298"></a>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth aside,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p299"></a>And <i>nothing</i> hindereth it—not even sword, not even fire.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p300"></a>His form was turned upside down, but <i>his</i> prayer was unrestrained,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p301"></a>And straight was its path on high to the abode of the angels.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p302"></a>The more the affliction of the chosen martyr was increased,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p303"></a>The more from his lips was all confession heard.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p304"></a>The martyrs longed for the whetted sword affectionately,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p305"></a>And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p306"></a>A new work has the Son of God wrought in the world—</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p307"></a>That dreadful death should be yearned for <a name="fr_3341"></a><a href="#fn_3341"><font size="1">3342</font></a>
  by many.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p309"></a>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p310"></a>Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p311"></a>That death is bitter, every one knoweth lo! from earliest time:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p312"></a>To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be slain.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p313"></a>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p314"></a>And greeted it with smiles:  for it was that which was the occasion of their crowns.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p315"></a>As though it had been something hated, they left the body to be beaten:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p316"></a>Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p317"></a>For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p318"></a>Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they desired.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p319"></a>The Son of God slew death by His crucifixion;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p320"></a>And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the martyrs.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p321"></a>With a wounded serpent one playeth without fear;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p322"></a>A slain lion even a coward will drag along:</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p323"></a>The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p324"></a>The dread lion did the Son of God slay by His sufferings.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p325"></a>Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of Hades;</p>

 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p330"></a><i>Who</i> could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p331"></a>The Son of God crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,</p>

  the blood of their necks.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p341"></a>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,</p>

 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p370"></a>Lo! the sons of Belial who slew Naboth are witnesses;</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p371"></a>And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are witnesses.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p372"></a>Let us now see which witnesses, and which old men,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p373"></a>And which city can stand with confidence <a name="fr_3349"></a><a href="#fn_3349"><font size="1">3350</font></a>
  before God.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p375"></a>Sons of Belial were those witnesses of that adulterous woman,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p376"></a>And lo! their shame is all portrayed in their names.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p377"></a>Edessas just and righteous old men, her witnesses,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p378"></a>Were like Naboth, who himself also was slain for righteousness sake.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p379"></a>They were not like the two lying sons of Belial,</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p380"></a>Nor is Edessa like Zion, which also crucified <i>the Lord</i>.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p381"></a>Like herself her old men were false, yea dared</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p382"></a>To shed on the ground innocent blood wickedly.</p> 
 <p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p383"></a><i>But</i> by these witnesses here lo! the truth is spoken.—</p> 
 <p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p384"></a>Blessed be He who gave us the treasure-store of their crowns!</p> 
 <p class="c42"><a name="ix.xiv.ii-p385"></a><i>Here</i> endeth the Homily on Guria and Shamuna.</p>
