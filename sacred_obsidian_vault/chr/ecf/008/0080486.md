 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xvii-p3"></a>“In short, when Mars, holding the centre in his house, regards Saturn quarterly, with Mercury towards the centre, the full moon coming upon him, in the daily <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xvii-p3.1"></a>Genesis</span>, he produces murderers, and those who are to fall by the sword, <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">843</font></a>
  bloody, drunken, lustful, devilish men, inquirers into secrets, <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">844</font></a>
  malefactors, sacrilegious persons, and such like; especially when there was no one of the good stars looking on.  But again Mars himself, having a quarterly position with respect to Venus, in a direction toward the centre, while no good star looks on, produces adulterers and incestuous persons.  Venus with the Moon, in the borders and houses of Saturn, if she was with Saturn, and Mars looking on, produces women that are viragos, ready for agriculture, building, and every manly work, to commit adultery with whom they please, and not to be convicted by their husbands, to use no delicacy, no ointments, nor feminine robes and shoes, but to live after the fashion of men.  But the unpropitious Venus makes men to be as women, and not to act in any respect as men, if she is with Mars in Aries; on the contrary, she produces women if she is in Capricorn or Aquarius.”</p>
