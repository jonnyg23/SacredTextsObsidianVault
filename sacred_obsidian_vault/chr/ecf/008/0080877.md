 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.xix-p2"></a>“These things seem good to the all-seeing God, that you lord it over no man; that you trouble no one, unless any one of his own accord subject himself to you, worshipping you, and sacrificing and pouring libations, and partaking of your table, or accomplishing aught else that they ought not, or shedding blood, or tasting dead flesh, or filling themselves with that which is torn of beasts, or that which is cut, or that which is strangled, or aught else that is unclean.  But those who betake themselves to my law, you not only shall not touch, but shall also do honour to, and shall flee from, their presence.  For whatsoever shall please them, being just, respecting you, that you shall be constrained to suffer.  But if any of those who worship me go astray, either committing adultery, or practising magic, or living impurely, or doing any other of the things which are not well-pleasing to me, then they will have to suffer something at your hands or those of others, according to my order.  But upon them, when they repent, I, judging of their repentance, whether it be worthy of pardon or not, shall give sentence.  These things, therefore, ye ought to remember and to do, well knowing that not even your thoughts shall be able to be concealed from Him.</p>
