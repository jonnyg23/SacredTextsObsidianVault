 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.iv-p2"></a>“But I maintain, from what has happened to you, <a name="fr_1223"></a><a href="#fn_1223"><font size="1">1224</font></a>
  that all things are managed by the providence of God, and that your separation from your family for so many years was providential; <a name="fr_1224"></a><a href="#fn_1224"><font size="1">1225</font></a>
  for since, if they had been with you, they perhaps would not have listened to the doctrines of the true religion, it was arranged that your children should travel with their mother, should be shipwrecked, should be supposed to have perished, and should be sold; <a name="fr_1225"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">1226</font></a>
  moreover, that they should be educated in the learning of the Greeks, especially in the atheistic doctrines, in order that, as being acquainted with them, they might be the better able to refute them; and in addition to this, that they should become attached to the true religion, and be enabled to be united with me, so as to help me in my preaching; furthermore, that their brother Clement should meet in the same place, and that thus his mother should be recognised, and through her cure <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">1227</font></a>
  should be fully convinced of the right worship of God; <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">1228</font></a>
  that after no long interval the twins should recognise and be recognised, and the other day should fall in with you, and that you should receive back your own.  I do not think, then, that such a speedy filling in of circumstances, coming as it were from all quarters, so as to accomplish one design, could have happened without the direction of Providence.”</p>
