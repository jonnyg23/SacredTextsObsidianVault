 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.ix-p2"></a>“But I know that ye will do these things if you fix love into your minds; and for its entrance there is one only fit means, viz., the common partaking of food. <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">896</font></a>
   Wherefore see to it that ye be frequently one anothers guests, as ye are able, that you may not fail of it.  For it is the cause of well-doing, and well-doing of salvation.  Therefore all of you present your provisions in common to all your brethren in God, knowing that, giving temporal things, you shall receive eternal things.  Much more feed the hungry, and give drink to the thirsty, and clothing to the naked; visit the sick; showing yourselves to those who are in prison, help them as ye are able, and receive strangers into your houses with all alacrity.  However, not to speak in detail, philanthropy will teach you to do everything that is good, as misanthropy suggests ill-doing to those who will not be saved.</p>
