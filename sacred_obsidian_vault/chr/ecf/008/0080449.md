 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xliii-p2"></a>“If, then, it seems to you that this is so, and what has been said on this subject is enough, let us come to inquire into other matters; or if you think that something is still wanting, let us go over it again.”  And the old man said:  “I wish <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.x.xliii-Page_177"></a>you would go over this again, since there are many other things which I see to be made in like manner:  for both the fruits of trees are produced in like manner, beautifully formed and wonderfully rounded; and the appearance of the leaves is formed with immense gracefulness, and the green membrane is woven with exquisite art:  then, moreover, fleas, mice, lizards, and such like, shall we say that these are made by God?  Hence, from these vile objects a conjecture is derived concerning the superior, that they are by no means formed by the art of mind.”  “You infer well,” said Aquila, “concerning the texture of leaves, and concerning small animals, that from these belief is withdrawn from the superior creatures; but let not these things deceive you, that you should think that God, working as it were only with two hands, could not complete all things that are made; but remember how my brother Niceta answered you yesterday, and truly disclosed the mystery before the time, as a son speaking with his father, and explained why and how things are made which seem to be useless.”</p>
