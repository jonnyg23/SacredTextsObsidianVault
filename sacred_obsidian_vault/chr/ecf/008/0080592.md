 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.iii-p2"></a>While he thus spoke, I knelt to him, and entreated him, declining the honour and the authority of the chair.  But he answered:  “Concerning this matter do not ask me; for it has seemed to me to be good that thus it be, and all the more if you decline it.  For this chair has not need of a presumptuous man, ambitious of occupying it, but of one pious in conduct and deeply skilled in the word <i>of God.</i>  But show me a better <i>than yourself,</i> who has travelled more with me, and has heard more of my discourses, and has learned better the regulations of the Church, and I shall not force you to do well against your will.  But it will not be in your power to show me your superior; for you are the choice first-fruits of the multitudes saved through me.  However, consider this further, that if you do not undertake the administration of the Church, through fear of the danger of sin, you may be sure that you sin more, when you have it in your power to help the godly, who are, as it were, at sea and in danger, and will not do so, providing only for your own interest, and not for the common advantage of all.  But that it behoves you altogether to undertake the danger, <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.iii.iii-Page_219"></a>while I do not cease to ask it of you for the help of all, you well understand.  The sooner, therefore, you consent, so much the sooner will you relieve me from anxiety.</p>
