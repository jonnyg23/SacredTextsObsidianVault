 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxiii-p2"></a>“He alone turned into the four contrary elements <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">975</font></a>
  the one, first, simple substance.  Thus combining them, He made of them myriads of compounds, that, being turned into opposite natures, and mingled, they might effect the pleasure of life from the combination of contraries.  In like manner, He alone, having created races of angels and spirits by the <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxiii-p3.1"></a>Fiat</span> of His will, peopled the heavens; as also He decked the visible firmament with stars, to which also He assigned their paths and arranged their courses.  He compacted the earth for the production of fruits.  He set bounds to the sea, marking out a dwelling-place on the dry land. <a name="fr_975"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">976</font></a>
   He stores up the things in Hades, designating it as the place of souls; and He filled all places with air, that all living creatures might be able to breathe safely in order that they might live.</p>
