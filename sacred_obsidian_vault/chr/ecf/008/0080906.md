 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xxiii-p2"></a>“This then we would have you know, that unless any one of his own accord give himself over as a slave to demons, as I said before, the demon has no power against him.  Choosing, therefore, to worship one God, and refraining from the table of demons, and undertaking chastity with philanthropy and righteousness, and being baptized with the thrice-blessed invocation for the remission of sins, and devoting yourselves as much as you can to the perfection of purity, you can escape everlasting punishment, and be constituted heirs of eternal blessings.”</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xxiii-p3"></a>Having thus spoken, he ordered those to approach who were distressed with diseases; <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">1119</font></a>
  and thus many approached, having come together through the experience of those who had been healed yesterday.  And he having laid his hands upon them and prayed, and immediately healed them, and having charged them and the others to come earlier, he bathed and partook of food, and went to sleep.</p>
