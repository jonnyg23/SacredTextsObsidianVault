 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.xxvi-p2"></a>“For our mind, whenever it is impressed delightfully with the image of a beloved one, always seeing the form as in a mirror, is tormented by the recollection; and if it do not obtain its desire, it contrives ways of obtaining it; but if it do obtain it, it is rather increased, like fire having a supply of wood, and especially when there is no fear impressed upon the soul of the lover before the rise of passion.  For as water extinguishes fire, so fear is the extinguisher of unreasonable desire.  Whence I, having learned from a certain Jew both to understand and to do the things that are pleasing to God, am not to be entrapped into adultery by your lying fables.  But may God help you in your wish and efforts to be chaste, and afford a remedy to your soul burning with love.</p>
