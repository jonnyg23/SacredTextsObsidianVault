 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></a>“But know all of you that the bishop labours more than you all; because each of you suffers his own affliction, but he his own and that of every one.  Wherefore, O Clement, preside as a helper to every one according to your ability, being careful of the cares of all.  Whence I know that in your undertaking the administration, I do not confer, but receive, a favour.  But take courage and bear it generously, as knowing that God will recompense you when you enter the haven of rest, the greatest of blessings, a reward that cannot be taken from you, in proportion as you have undertaken more labour for the safety of all.  So that, if many of the brethren should hate you on account of your lofty righteousness, their hatred shall nothing hurt you, but the love of the righteous God shall greatly benefit you.  Therefore endeavour to shake off the praise that arises from injustice, and to attain the profitable praise that is from Christ on account of righteous administration.”</p>
