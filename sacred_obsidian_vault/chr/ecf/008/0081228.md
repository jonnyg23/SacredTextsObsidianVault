 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.vii-p2"></a>But the virgin of the Lord advanced in age and in virtues; and though, in the words of the Psalmist, her father and mother had forsaken her, the Lord took her up. <a name="fr_1696"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">1697</font></a>
   For daily was she visited by angels, daily did she enjoy a divine vision, which preserved her from all evil, and made her to abound in all good.  And so she reached her fourteenth year; and not only were the wicked unable to charge her with anything worthy of reproach, but all the good, who knew her life and conversation, judged her to be worthy of admiration.  Then the high priest publicly announced that the virgins who were publicly settled in the temple, and had reached this time of life, should return home and get married, according to the custom of the nation and the ripeness of their years.  The others readily obeyed this command; but Mary alone, the virgin of the Lord, answered that she could not do this, saying both that her parents had devoted her to the service of the Lord, and <a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a> <a name="vii.vi.vii-Page_386"></a>that, moreover, she herself had made to the Lord a vow of virginity, which she would never violate by any intercourse with man.  And the high priest, being placed in great perplexity of mind, seeing that neither did he think that the vow should be broken contrary to the Scripture, which says, Vow and pay, <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">1698</font></a>
  nor did he dare to introduce a custom unknown to the nation, gave order that at the festival, which was at hand, all the chief persons from Jerusalem and the neighbourhood should be present, in order that from their advice he might know what was to be done in so doubtful a case.  And when this took place, they resolved unanimously that the Lord should be consulted upon this matter.  And when they all bowed themselves in prayer, the high priest went to consult God in the usual way.  Nor had they long to wait:  in the hearing of all a voice issued from the oracle and from the mercy-seat, that, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, a man should be sought out to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted and espoused.  For it is clear that Isaiah says:  A rod shall come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall ascend from his root; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of wisdom and piety; and he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord. <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">1699</font></a>
   According to this prophecy, therefore, he predicted that all of the house and family of David that were unmarried and fit for marriage should bring there rods to the altar; and that he whose rod after it was brought should produce a flower, and upon the end of whose rod the Spirit of the Lord should settle in the form of a dove, was the man to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted and espoused.</p>
