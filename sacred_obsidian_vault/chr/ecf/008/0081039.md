 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.xii-p2"></a>When both were silent, I said:  “Since I know accurately the science, but our lord and our father are not in this condition, I should like if Annubion himself were here, to have a discussion with him in the presence of my father.  For thus would the matter be able to become public, when one practically acquainted with the subject has held the discussion with one equally informed.” <a name="fr_1216"></a><a href="#fn_1216"><font size="1">1217</font></a>
   And our father answered:  “Where, then, is it possible to fall in with Annubion?”  And Peter said:  “In Antioch, for I learn that Simon Magus is there, whose inseparable companion Annubion is.  When, then, we go there, if we come upon them, the discussion can take place.”  And so, when we had discussed many subjects, and rejoiced at the recognition and given thanks to God, evening came down upon us, and we turned to sleep.</p>
