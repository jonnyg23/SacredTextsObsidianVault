 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p2"></a>And Pilate seeing, fear seized him, and immediately he wished to rise from the tribunal.  And while he was thinking of this, <i>viz</i>., to rise and go away, his wife sent to him, saying:  Have nothing to do with that just man, <a name="fr_1956"></a><a href="#fn_1956"><font size="1">1957</font></a>
  for I have suffered much on account of him this night.  And Pilate, calling the Jews, said to them:  Ye know that my wife is a worshipper of God, and in Judaism thinks rather with you.  The Jews say to him:  So it is, and we know.  Pilate says to them:  Lo, my wife has sent to me, saying:  Have nothing to do with that just man, <a name="fr_1957"></a><a href="#fn_1957"><font size="1">1958</font></a>
  for I have suffered much on account of him this night.  And the Jews answering, said to Pilate:  Did we not say to thee that he is a magician?  Lo, he has sent a vision of dreams to thy wife.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p5"></a>Pilate called Jesus, and said to him:  What is it that these witness against thee, and sayest thou nothing to them?  And Jesus answered:  If they had not the power, they would not speak.  Every one has power over his own mouth to say good and evil; let them see <a name="fr_1958"></a><a href="#fn_1958"><font size="1">1959</font></a>
  <i>to it</i>.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p7"></a>And the elders of the Jews answering, say to Jesus:  What shall we see?  First, that thou wast born of fornication; second, that at thy birth in Bethlehem there took place a massacre of infants; third, that thy father Joseph and thy mother Mary fled into Egypt, because they had no confidence in the people.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p8"></a>Some of the bystanders, kind <i>men</i> of the Jews, say:  We say that he was not born of fornication; but we know that Mary was espoused to Joseph, and that he was not born of fornication.  Pilate says to the Jews who said that he was of fornication:  This speech of yours is not true, seeing that the betrothal took place, as these of your nation say.  Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate:  We with all the multitude say that he was born of fornication, and that he is a magician; but these are proselytes, and his disciples.  And Pilate, calling Annas and Caiaphas, says to them:  What are proselytes?  They say to him:  They have been born sons of the Gen<a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a> <a name="vii.xv.iii-Page_441"></a>tiles, and then have become Jews.  Then answered those who testified that Jesus was not born of fornication, Lazarus and Asterius, Antonius and James, Annes and Azaras, Samuel and Isaac, Finees and Crispus, Agrippa and Judas:  We were not born proselytes, but are sons of the Jews, and we speak the truth; for we were present at the betrothal of Mary.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p9"></a>And Pilate, calling to him those twelve men who proved that Jesus had not been born of fornication, said to them:  I adjure you by the health of Cæsar, tell me if it be true that Jesus was not born of fornication.  They say to Pilate:  We have a law not to swear, because it is a sin; but let them swear by the health of Cæsar that it is not as we say, and we are worthy of death.  Then said Pilate to Annas and Caiaphas:  Answer you nothing to those things which these testify?  Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate:  Those twelve are believed that he is not born of fornication; we—all the people—cry out that he was born of fornication, and is a magician, and says that he himself is the Son of God and a king, and we are not believed.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p10"></a>And Pilate ordered all the multitude to go outside, except the twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, and ordered to separate Jesus from them.  And Pilate says to them:  For what reason do the Jews wish to put Jesus to death?  And they say to him:  They are angry because he heals on the Sabbath.  Pilate said:  For a good work do they wish to put him to death?  They say to him:  Yes, my lord.</p>
