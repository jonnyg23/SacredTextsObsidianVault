 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.iii-p2"></a>And it happened that, in the time of the feast, among those who were offering incense to the Lord, Joachim stood getting ready his gifts in the sight of the Lord.  And the priest, Ruben by name, coming to him, said:  It is not lawful for thee to stand among those who are doing sacrifice to God, because God has not blessed thee so as to give thee seed in Israel.  Being therefore put to shame in the sight of the people, he retired from the temple of the Lord weeping, and did not return to his house, but went to his flocks, taking with him his shepherds into the mountains to a far country, so that for five months his wife Anna could hear no tidings of him.  And she prayed with tears, saying:  O Lord, most mighty God of Israel, why hast Thou, seeing that already Thou hast not given me children, taken from me my husband also?  Behold, now five months that I have not seen my husband; and I know not where he is tarrying; <a name="fr_1618"></a><a href="#fn_1618"><font size="1">1619</font></a>
  nor, if I knew him to be dead, could I bury him.  And while she wept excessively, she entered into the court of His house; and she fell on her face in prayer, and poured out her supplications before the Lord.  After this, rising from her prayer, and lifting her eyes to God, she saw a sparrows nest in a laurel tree, <a name="fr_1619"></a><a href="#fn_1619"><font size="1">1620</font></a>
  and uttered her voice to the Lord with groaning, and said:  Lord God Almighty, who hast given offspring to every creature, to beasts wild and tame, to serpents, and birds, and fishes, and they all rejoice over their young ones, Thou hast shut out me alone from the gift of Thy benignity.  For Thou, O God, knowest my heart, that from the beginning of my married life I have vowed that, if Thou, O God, shouldst give me son or daughter, I would offer them to Thee in Thy holy temple.  And while she was thus speaking, suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared before her, saying:  Be not afraid, Anna, for there is seed for thee in the decree of God; and all generations even to the end shall wonder at that which shall be born of thee.  And when he had thus spoken, he vanished out of her sight.  But she, in fear and dread because she had seen such a sight, and heard such words, at length went into her bed-chamber, and threw herself on the bed as if dead.  And for a whole day and night she remained in great trembling and in prayer.  And after these things she called to her her servant, and said to her:  Dost thou see me deceived in my widowhood and in great perplexity, and hast thou been unwilling to come in to me?  Then she, with a slight murmur, thus answered and said:  If God hath shut up thy womb, and hath taken away thy husband from thee, what can I do for thee?  And when Anna heard this, she lifted up her voice, and wept aloud.</p>
