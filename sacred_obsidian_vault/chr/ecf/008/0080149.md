 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xii-p2"></a>“Therefore, after the death of Dositheus Simon took Luna to himself; and with her he still goes about, as you see, deceiving multitudes, and asserting that he himself is a certain power which is above God the Creator, while Luna, who is with him, has been brought down from the higher heavens, and that she is Wisdom, the mother of all things, for whom, says he, the Greeks and barbarians contending, were able in some measure to see an image of her; but of herself, as she is, as the dweller with the first and only God, they were wholly ignorant.  Propounding these and other things of the same sort, he has deceived many.  But I ought also to state this, which I remember that I myself saw.  Once, when this Luna of his was in a certain tower, a great multitude had assembled to see her, and were standing around the tower on all sides; but she was seen by all the people to lean forward, and to look out through all the windows of that tower. <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">609</font></a>
   Many other wonderful things he did and does; so that men, being astonished at them, think that he himself is the great God.”</p>
