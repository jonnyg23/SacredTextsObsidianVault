 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.iv-p2"></a>Pilate, filled with fury, went forth outside of the prætorium, and says to them:  I take the sun to witness that I find in this man not even one fault.  The Jews answered and said to the governor:  If he were not an evil-doer, we should never have delivered him to thee.  Pilate says to them:  Take him, and judge him according to your law.  The Jews answered:  It is not permitted to us to put any one to death.  Pilate says to them:  Has God said to you not to put any one to death? has He therefore said to me that I am to kill?</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iv-p3"></a>Pilate, having again gone into the prætorium, called Jesus to him privately, and said to Him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  Jesus answered Pilate:  Speakest thou this of thyself, or have others said <i>it</i> to thee of me?  Pilate answered:  Am I a Jew?  Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me.  What hast thou done?  Jesus answering, said:  My kingdom is not of this world.  If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would assuredly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.  Pilate said to Him:  Art thou then a king?  Jesus said to him:  Thou sayest that I am a king.  For I for this was born, and for this have I come, that I should bear witness to the truth; and every one who is of the truth hears my voice.  Pilate says to him:  What is truth?  Jesus says:  Truth is from heaven.  Pilate says:  Is not there truth upon earth?  Jesus says to Pilate:  Notice how the truth-speaking are judged by those who have power upon earth.</p>
