 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p2"></a>Then Peter began to instruct me in this manner: <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">577</font></a>
   “When God had made the world, as Lord of the universe, He appointed chiefs over the several creatures, over the trees even, and the mountains, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all things which He had made, as we have told you; for it were too long to mention them one by one.  He set, therefore, an angel as chief over the angels, a spirit over the spirits, a star over the stars, a demon over the demons, a bird over the birds, a beast over the beasts, a serpent over the serpents, a fish over the fishes, a man over men, who is Christ Jesus.  But He is called <i>Christ</i> by a certain excellent rite of religion; for as there are certain names common to kings, as Arsaces among the Persians, Cæsar among the Romans, Pharaoh among the Egyptians, so among the Jews a king is called <i>Christ</i>.  And the reason of this appellation is this:  Although indeed He was the Son of God, and the beginning of all things, He became man; Him first God anointed with oil which was taken from the wood of the tree of life:  from that anointing therefore He is called <i>Christ</i>.  Thence, moreover, He Himself also, according to the appointment of His Father, anoints with similar oil every one of the pious when they come to His kingdom, for their refreshment after their labours, as having got over the difficulties of the way; so that their light may shine, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, they may be endowed with immortality. <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">578</font></a>
   But it occurs to me that I have sufficiently explained to you the whole nature of that branch from which that ointment is taken.”</p>
