 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.xvi-p2"></a>“Thus have I in part set before you the amours of all the more noted gods, beloved, that you may know that fanaticism respecting this thing is confined to senseless men.  Therefore they are mortal, and spend their lives sadly, because through their zeal they proclaim those things to be evil which the gods esteem as excellent.  Therefore for the future you will be blessed, imitating the gods, and not men.  For men, seeing you preserving that which is thought to be chastity, on account of what they themselves feel, praise you indeed, but do not help you.  But the gods, seeing you like unto themselves, will both praise and help.</p>
