 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.ix-p2"></a>And when Jesus was six years old, His mother sent Him to draw water.  And when Jesus had come to the fountain, or to the well, there were great crowds there, and they broke His pitcher.  And He took the cloak which He had on, and filled it with water, and carried it to His mother Mary.  And His mother, seeing the miracles which Jesus had done, kissed Him, and said:  O Lord, hear me, and save my son.</p>
