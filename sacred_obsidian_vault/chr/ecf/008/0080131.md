 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxix-p2"></a>“To him our James began to show, that whatsoever things the prophets say they have taken from the law, and what they have spoken is in accordance with the law.  He also made some statements respecting the books of the Kings, in what way, and when, and by whom they were written, and how they ought to be used.  And when he had discussed most fully concerning the law, and had, by a most clear exposition, brought into light whatever things are in it concerning Christ, he showed by most abundant proofs that Jesus is the Christ, and that in Him are fulfilled all the prophecies which related to His humble advent.  For he showed that two advents of Him are foretold:  one in humiliation, which He has accomplished; the other in glory, which is hoped for to be accomplished, when He shall come to give the kingdom to those who believe in Him, and who observe all things which He has commanded.  And when he had plainly taught the people concerning these things, he added this also:  That unless a man be baptized in water, in the name of the threefold blessedness, as the true Prophet taught, he can neither receive remission of sins nor enter into the kingdom of heaven; and he declared that this is the prescription of the unbegotten God.  To which he added this also:  Do not think that we speak of two unbegotten Gods, or that one is divided into two, or that the same is made male and female.  But we speak of the only-begotten Son of God, not sprung from another source, but ineffably self-originated; and in like manner we speak of the Paraclete. <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">595</font></a>
   But when he had spoken some things also concerning baptism, through seven successive days he persuaded all the people and the high priest that they should hasten straightway to receive baptism.”</p>
