 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.v-p2"></a>“Wherefore we must, above all things, hasten to the knowledge of the truth, that, as with a light kindled thereat, we may be able to dispel the darkness of errors:  for ignorance, as we have said, is a great evil; but because it has no substance, it is easily dispelled by those who are in earnest.  For ignorance is nothing else than not knowing what is good for us; once know this, and ignorance perishes.  Therefore the knowledge of truth ought to be eagerly sought after; and no one can confer it except the true Prophet.  For this is the gate of life to those who will enter, and the road of good works to those going to the city of salvation.</p>
