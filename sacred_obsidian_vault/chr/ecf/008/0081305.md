 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.v-p2"></a>Pilate therefore, leaving Jesus within the prætorium, went out to the Jews, and says to them:  I find not even one fault in him.  The Jews say to him:  He said, I can destroy that temple, and in three days raise it again.  Pilate said to them:  What temple?  The Jews say to him:  <i>The temple</i> which Solomon built in forty and six years; and he says <i>that he can</i> destroy and build it in three days.  Pilate says to them:  I am innocent of the blood of this man; see ye <i>to it</i>.  The Jews say to him:  His blood <i>be</i> upon us, and upon our children.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p3"></a>And Pilate, calling the elders and priests and Levites, says to them privately:  Do not do so; for in nothing, though you accuse him, do I find him deserving of death, not even about the healing and the breaking of the Sabbath.  The priests and Levites and elders say:  Tell us, if any one blaspheme Cæsar, is he deserving of death or not?  Pilate says to them:  He deserves to die.  The Jews answered him:  How much more is he who has blasphemed God deserving to die!</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p4"></a>And the governor ordered the Jews to go outside of the prætorium; and calling Jesus, said to Him:  What am I to do to thee?  Jesus says to Pilate:  As it has been given <i>thee</i>.  Pilate says:  How has it been given?  Jesus says:  Moses and the prophets made proclamation of my death and resurrection.  And the Jews, hearing this, say to Pilate:  Why do you desire any more to hear blasphemy?  And Pilate said:  If this speech is blasphemous, do you take him, and lead him to your synagogue, and judge him according to your law.  The Jews say to Pilate:  Our law holds, If a man have sinned against a man, he is worthy to receive forty less one; but he who has blasphemed against God, to be stoned.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p5"></a>Pilate says to them:  Then judge him according to your law.  The Jews say to Pilate:  We wish that he be crucified.  Pilate says to them:  He does not deserve to be crucified.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p6"></a>And the governor, looking upon the people of the Jews standing round, saw very many of the Jews weeping, and said:  All the multitude does not wish him to die.  The elders say to Pilate:  And for this reason have we come—the whole multitude—that he should die.  Pilate said to the Jews:  What has he done that he <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a> <a name="vii.xv.v-Page_442"></a>should die?  They say:  Because he said that he was the Son of God, and a king.</p>
