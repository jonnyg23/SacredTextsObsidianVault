 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.iv-p2"></a>Then Peter began to say:  “Those who speak the word of truth, and who enlighten the souls of men, seem to me to be like the rays of the sun, which, when once they have come forth and appeared to the world, can no longer be concealed or hidden, while they are not so much seen by men, as they afford sight to all.  Therefore it was well said by One to the heralds of the truth, Ye are the light of the world, and a city set upon a hill cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may enlighten all who are in the house. <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">809</font></a>
 ”  Then said the old man:  “He said well, whoever he is.  But let one of you state what, according to his opinion, ought to be followed, that we may direct our speech to a definite aim.  For, in order to find the truth, it is not sufficient to overthrow the things that are spoken on the other side, but also that one should himself bring forward what he who is on the other side may oppose.  Therefore, in order that both parties may be on an equal footing, it seems to me to be right that each of us should first enunciate what opinion he holds.  And, if you please, I shall begin first.  I say, then, that the world is not governed according to the providence of God, because we see that many things in it are done unjustly and disorderly; but I say that it is <i>genesis</i> that does and regulates all things.”</p>
