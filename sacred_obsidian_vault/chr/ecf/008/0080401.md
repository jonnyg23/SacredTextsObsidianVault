 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xxxiv-p2"></a>When Niceta had spoken thus, our mother fell down at Peters feet, entreating and beseeching him that both herself and her hostess might be baptized without delay; “that,” said she, “I may not even for a single day suffer the loss of the company and society of my sons.”  In like manner, we her sons also entreated Peter.  But he said:  “What!  Do you think that I alone am unpitiful, and that I do not wish you to enjoy your mothers society at meals?  But she must fast at least one day first, and so be baptized; and this because I have heard from her a certain declaration, by which her faith has been made manifest to me, and which has given evidence of her belief; otherwise she must have been instructed and taught many days before she could have been baptized.”</p>
