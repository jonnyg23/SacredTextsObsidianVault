 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xv-p2"></a>But having spent <i>some</i> days, and not having been able to recover the whole debt, for the sake of speed I neglected the balance, as being a hindrance, and myself also set sail for Judæa, and in fifteen days arrived at Cæsarea Stratonis. <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">911</font></a>
   And when I had landed, and was seeking for a lodging, I learned that one named Peter, who was the most esteemed disciple of the Man who had appeared in Judæa, and had done signs and wonders, was going to have a verbal controversy next day with Simon, a Samaritan of Gitthi.  When I heard this, I begged to be shown his lodging; and as soon as I learned it, I stood before the door.  And those who were in the house, seeing me, discussed the question who I was, and whence I had come.  And, behold, Barnabas came out; and as soon as he saw me he embraced me, rejoicing greatly, and weeping.  And he took me by the hand, and conducted me to where Peter was, saying to me, “This is Peter, of whom I told you as being the greatest in the wisdom of God, and I have spoken to him of you continually.  Therefore enter freely, <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">912</font></a>
  for I have told him your excellent qualities, without falsehood; and, at the same time, have disclosed to him your intention, so that he himself also is desirous to see you.  Therefore I offer him a great gift when by my hands I present you to him.”  Thus saying, he presented me, and said, “This, O Peter, is Clement.”</p>
