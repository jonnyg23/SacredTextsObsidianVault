 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></a>Having said this, and more than this, he looked again upon the multitude, and said:  “And you also, my beloved brethren and fellow-servants, be subject to the president of the truth in all things, knowing this, that he who grieves him has not received Christ, with whose chair he has been entrusted; and he who has not received Christ shall be regarded as having despised the Father; wherefore he shall be cast out of the good kingdom.  On this account, endeavour to come to all the assemblies, lest as deserters you incur the charge of sin through the disheartening of your captain.  Wherefore all of you think before all else of the things that relate to him, knowing this, that the wicked one, being the more hostile on account of every one of you, wars against him alone.  Do you therefore strive to live in affection towards him, and in kindliness towards one another, and to obey him, in order that both he may be comforted and you may be saved.</p>
