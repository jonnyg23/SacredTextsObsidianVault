 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.vi-p2"></a>A God-fearing Jew, therefore, Nicodemus by name, stood up in the midst, and said to Pilate:  I entreat your highness to permit me to say a few words.  Say on, said Pilate.  Nicodemus says:  I, being present in the synagogue, said to the priests, and the Levites, and the scribes, and the people, What have you to say against this man?  This man does many miracles, such as man has never yet done nor will do.  Let him go, therefore; and if indeed what he does be from God, it will stand; but if from man, it will be destroyed. <a name="fr_1883"></a><a href="#fn_1883"><font size="1">1884</font></a>
   Just as happened also when God sent Moses into Egypt, and Pharoah king of Egypt told him to do a miracle, and he did it.  Then Pharoah had also two magicians, Jannes and Jambres; and they also did miracles by the use of magic art, but not such as Moses did. <a name="fr_1884"></a><a href="#fn_1884"><font size="1">1885</font></a>
   And the Egyptians held these magicians to be gods; but because they were not from God, what they did was destroyed.  This Jesus, then, raised up Lazarus, and he is alive.  On this account I entreat thee, my lord, by no means to allow this man to be put to death.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.vi-p5"></a>The Hebrews were enraged against Nicodemus, and said:  Mayst thou receive the truth of Jesus, and have a portion with him.  Nicodemus says:  Amen, amen; be it to me as you say.</p>
