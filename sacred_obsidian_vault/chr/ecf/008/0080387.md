 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xx-p2"></a>Then Peter, incapable of deception, and moved with compassion, began to say:  “There is a certain young man among those who follow me for the sake of religion and sect, a Roman citizen, who told me that he had a father and two twin brothers, of whom not one is left to him.  My mother, he said, as I learned from my father, saw a vision, that she should depart from the Roman city for a time with her twin sons, else they should perish by a dreadful death; and when she had departed, she was nevermore seen.  And afterwards his father set out to search for his wife and sons, and was also lost.”</p>
