 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lvi-p2"></a>“All we, therefore, who went before you, considered that in the meantime you should not go <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lvi-Page_207"></a>up to Antioch, till we see if the hatred of you which he has sown among the people be in any degree lessened by his departure.”  When he who had come from Antioch had imparted this information, Peter, looking to our father, said, “Faustinianus, your countenance has been transformed by Simon Magus, as is evident; for he, thinking that he was being sought for by Cæsar for punishment, has fled in terror, and has placed his own countenance upon you, if haply you might be apprehended instead of him, and put to death, that so he might cause sorrow to your sons.”  But my father, when he heard this, crying out, said with tears:  “You have judged rightly, O Peter:  for Anubion also, who is very friendly with me, began to inform me in a certain mysterious way of his plots; but unhappily I did not believe him, because I had done him no harm.”</p>
