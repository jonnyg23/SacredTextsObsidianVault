 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.i-p7"></a>And Joseph rose up and said to Annas and Caiaphas:  Truly and well do you wonder, since you have heard that Jesus has been seen alive from the dead, ascending up into heaven.  But it is more to be wondered at that he is not the only one who has risen from the dead:  but he has raised up alive out of their tombs many others of the dead, and they have been seen by many in Jerusalem.  And hear me now, that we all know the blessed Simeon, the great priest, who took up with his hands Jesus, when an infant, in the temple.  And Simeon himself had two sons, full brothers; and we all were at their falling asleep, and at their burial.  Go, therefore, and see their tombs:  for they are open, because they have risen; and, behold, they are in the city of Arimathæa, living together in prayers.  And, indeed, they are heard crying out, but speaking with nobody, and they are silent as the dead.  But come, let us go to them; let us conduct them to us with all honour and respect.  And if we adjure them, perhaps they will speak to us of the mystery of their resurrection.</p>

 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.i-p9"></a>Karinus and Leucius, hearing this adjuration, trembled in their body, and groaned, being disturbed in heart.  And together they looked towards heaven, and with their fingers made the sign of the cross on their tongues, and immediately they spoke together, saying:  Give each of us sheets of paper, and let us write what we have seen and heard.  And they gave it to them.  And they sat down, and each of them wrote, saying:—</p>
