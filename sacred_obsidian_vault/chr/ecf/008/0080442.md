 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xxxvi-p2"></a>And when the old man had said this, Peter said to the chief man of the city:  “Since you have shown your good-will in our presence, it is not right that you should go away sorrowful; but we will accept from you favour for favour.  Show us your house, and make it ready, so that the discussion which is to be to-morrow may be held there, and that any who wish to be present to hear it may be admitted.”  When the chief man of the city heard this, he rejoiced greatly; and all the people also heard it gladly.  And when the crowds had dispersed, he pointed out his house; and the old man also was preparing to depart.  But I commanded one of my attendants to follow the old man secretly, and find out where he stayed.  And when we returned to our lodging, we told our brethren all our dealings with the old man; and so, as usual, we supped and went to sleep.</p>
