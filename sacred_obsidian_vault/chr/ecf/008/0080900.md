 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xvii-p2"></a>“For why do they oracularly foretell cures after a long time?  And why, if they are almighty, do they not effect cures without administering any medicine?  And for what reason do they prescribe remedies to some of those who pray to them, while to some, and it may be more suitable cases, they give no response?  Thus, whenever a cure is going to take place spontaneously, they promise, in order that they may get the credit of the cure; and others, having been sick, and having prayed, and having recovered spontaneously, attributed the cure to those whom they had invoked, and make offerings to them.  Those, however, who, after praying, have failed, are not able to offer their sacrifices.  But if the relatives of the dead, or any of their children, inquired into the losses, you would find the failures to be more than the successes.  But no one who has been taken in by them is willing to exhibit an accusation against them, through shame or fear; but, on the other hand, they conceal the crimes which they believe them to be guilty of.</p>
