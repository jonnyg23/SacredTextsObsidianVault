 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.vi-p2"></a>“And the old man answered: <a name="fr_1204"></a><a href="#fn_1204"><font size="1">1205</font></a>
   You have spoken truly, <a name="fr_1205"></a><a href="#fn_1205"><font size="1">1206</font></a>
  and yet, notwithstanding all your incomparable demonstration, I am prevented from yielding assent by my own personal knowledge.  For I was an astrologer, and dwelt first at Rome; and then forming a friendship with one who was of the family of Cæsar, I ascertained accurately the genesis of himself and his wife.  And tracing their history, I find all the deeds actually accomplished in exact accordance with their genesis, and therefore I cannot yield to your argument.  For the arrangement <a name="fr_1206"></a><a href="#fn_1206"><font size="1">1207</font></a>
  of her genesis was that which makes women commit adultery, fall in love with their own slaves, and perish abroad in the water.  And this actually took place; for she fell in love with her own slave, and not being able to bear the reproach, she fled with him, hurried to a foreign land, shared his bed, and perished in the sea.</p>
