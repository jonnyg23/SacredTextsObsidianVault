 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.x-p2"></a>Then all the saints of God asked the Lord to leave as a sign of victory the sign of His holy cross in the lower world, that its most impious officers might not retain as an offender any one whom the Lord had absolved.  And so it was done.  And the Lord set His cross in the midst of Hades, which is the sign of victory, and which will remain even to eternity.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.x-p3"></a>Then we all went forth thence along with the Lord, leaving Satan and Hades in Tartarus.  And to us and many others it was commanded that we should rise in the body, giving in the world a testimony of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of those things which had been done in the lower world.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.x-p4"></a>These are the things, dearest brethren, which we have seen, and which, adjured by you, we testify, He bearing witness who died for us, and rose again; because, as it was written, so has it been done in all points.</p>
