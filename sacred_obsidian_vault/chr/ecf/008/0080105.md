 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xliii-p2"></a>“Nevertheless, the truth everywhere prevailed; for, in proof that these things were done by divine power, we who had been very few became in the course of a few days, by the help of God, far more than they.  So that the priests at one time were afraid, lest haply, by the providence of God, to their confusion, the whole of the people should come over to our faith.  Therefore they often sent to us, and asked us to discourse to them concerning Jesus, whether He were the Prophet whom Moses foretold, who is the eternal Christ. <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">574</font></a>
   For on this point only does there seem to be any difference between us who believe in Jesus, and the unbelieving Jews.  But while they often made such requests to us, and we sought for a fitting opportunity, a week of years was completed from the passion of the Lord, the Church of the Lord which was constituted in Jerusalem was most plentifully multiplied and grew, being governed with most righteous ordinances by James, who was ordained bishop in it by the Lord.”</p>
