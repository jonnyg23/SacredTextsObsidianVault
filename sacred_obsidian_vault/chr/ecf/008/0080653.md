 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xx-p2"></a>“She, therefore, having taken up a manner of life according to the law, was, with the daughter who had been healed, driven out from her home by her husband, whose sentiments were opposed to ours.  But she, being faithful to her engagements, and being in affluent circumstances, remained a widow herself, but gave her daughter in marriage to a certain man who was attached to the true faith, and who was poor.  And, abstaining from marriage for the sake of her daughter, she bought two boys and educated them, and had them in place of sons.  And they being educated from their boyhood with Simon Magus, have learned all things concerning him.  For such was their friendship, that they were associated with him in all things in which he wished to unite with them.</p>
