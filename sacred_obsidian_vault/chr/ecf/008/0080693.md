 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.vi-p2"></a>“Such is the nature of the one and only God, who made the world, and who created us, and who has given us all things, that as long as any one is within the limit of piety, and does not <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.vi.vi-Page_240"></a>blaspheme His Holy Spirit, through His love towards him He brings the soul to Himself by reason of His love towards it.  And although it be sinful, it is His nature to save it, after it has been suitably punished for the deeds it hath done.  But if any one shall deny Him, or in any other way be guilty of impiety against Him, and then shall repent, he shall be punished indeed for the sins he hath committed against Him, but he shall be saved, because he turned and lived.  And perhaps excessive piety and supplication shall even be delivered from punishment, ignorance being admitted as a reason for the pardon of sin after repentance. <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">956</font></a>
   But those who do not repent shall be destroyed by the punishment of fire, even though in all other things they are most holy.  But, as I said, at an appointed time a fifth <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_956"><font size="1">957</font></a>
  part, being punished with eternal fire, shall be consumed.  For they cannot endure for ever who have been impious against the one God.</p>
