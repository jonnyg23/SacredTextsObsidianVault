 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxiii-p2"></a>“Let us then understand that there are two kinds of prophecy: <a name="fr_967"></a><a href="#fn_967"><font size="1">968</font></a>
   the one male; and let it be defined that the first, being the male, has been ranked after the other in the order of advent; but the second, being female, has been appointed to come first in the advent of the pairs.  This second, therefore, being amongst those born of woman, as the female superintendent of this present world, wishes to be thought masculine. <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_968"><font size="1">969</font></a>
   Wherefore, stealing the seeds of the male, and sowing them with her own seeds of the flesh, she brings forth the fruits—that is, words—as wholly her own.  And she promises that she will give the present earthly riches as a dowry, wishing to change the slow for the swift, the small for the greater.</p>
