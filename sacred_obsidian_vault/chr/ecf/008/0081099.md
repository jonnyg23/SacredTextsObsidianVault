 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.iv-p2"></a>And Simon said:  “How, then, if the framer of the world, who also fashioned Adam, was known, and known too by those who were just according to the law, and moreover by the just and unjust, and the whole world, does your teacher, coming after all these, say, <a name="fr_1374"></a><a href="#fn_1374"><font size="1">1375</font></a>
  No one has known the Father but the Son, even as no one knoweth the Son but the Father, and those to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him?  But he would not have made this statement, had he not proclaimed a Father who was still unrevealed, whom the law speaks of as the highest, and who has not given any utterance either good or bad (as Jeremiah testifies in the Lamentations <a name="fr_1375"></a><a href="#fn_1375"><font size="1">1376</font></a>
 ); who also, limiting the nations to seventy languages, according to the number of the sons of Israel who entered Egypt, and according to the boundaries of these nations, gave to his own Son, who is also called Lord, and who brought into order the heaven and the earth, the Hebrews as his portion, and defined him to be God of gods, that is, of the gods who received the other nations as their portions.  Laws, therefore, proceeded from all the so-called gods to their own divisions, which consist of the other nations.  In like manner also from the Son of the Lord of all came forth the law which is established among the Hebrews.  And this state of matters was determined on, that if any one should seek refuge in the law of any one, he should belong to the division of him whose law he undertook to obey.  No one knew the highest Father, who was unrevealed, just as they did not know that his Son was his Son.  Accordingly at this moment you yourself, in assigning the special attributes of the unrevealed Most High to the Son, do not know that he is the Son, being the Father of Jesus, who with you is called the Christ.”</p>
