 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.x-p2"></a>“This is the mystery of the hebdomad.  For He Himself is the rest of the whole who grants <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xx.x-Page_321"></a>Himself as a rest to those who imitate His greatness within their little measure.  For He is alone, sometimes comprehensible, sometimes incomprehensible, <i>sometimes limitable</i>, <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">1341</font></a>
  sometimes illimitable, having extensions which proceed from Him into infinity.  For thus He is comprehensible and incomprehensible, near and far, being here and there, as being the only existent one, and as giving a share of that mind which is infinite on every hand, in consequence of which souls breathe and possess life; <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">1342</font></a>
  and if they be separated from the body and be found with a longing for Him, they are borne along into His bosom, as in the winter time the mists of the mountains, attracted by the rays of the sun, are borne along immortal <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">1343</font></a>
  to it.  What affection ought therefore to arise within us if we gaze with our mind on His beautiful shape!  But otherwise it is absurd <i>to speak of beauty</i>.  For beauty cannot exist apart from shape; nor can one be attracted to the love of God, nor even deem that he can see Him, if God has no form.</p>
