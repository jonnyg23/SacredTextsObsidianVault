 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xix-p2"></a>“For God is almighty.  For He is good and righteous, now long-suffering to all, that those who will, repenting of the evils which they have done, and living well, may receive a worthy reward in the day in which all things are judged.  Wherefore now begin to obey God by reason of <a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xii.xix-Page_279"></a>good knowledge, <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1117</font></a>
  and to oppose your evil lusts and thoughts, that you may be able to recover the original saving worship which was committed to humanity.  For thus shall blessings straightway spring up to you, which, when you receive, you will thenceforth quit the trial of evils.  But give thanks to the Giver; being kings for ever of unspeakable good things, with the King of peace.  But in the present life, washing in a flowing river, or fountain, or even in the sea, with the thrice-blessed invocation, you shall not only be able to drive away the spirits which lurk in you; but yourselves no longer sinning, and undoubtingly believing God, you shall drive out evil spirits and dire demons, with terrible diseases, from others.  And sometimes they shall flee when you but look on them.  For they know those who have given themselves up to God.  Wherefore, honouring them, they flee affrighted, as you saw yesterday, how, when after the address I delayed praying for those who were suffering these maladies, through respect towards the worship they cried out, not being able to endure it for a short hour.</p>
