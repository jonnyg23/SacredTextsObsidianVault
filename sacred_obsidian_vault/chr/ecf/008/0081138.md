 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p2"></a>And Peter said:  “A man ought to punish himself through self-restraint, <a name="fr_1449"></a><a href="#fn_1449"><font size="1">1450</font></a>
  when his lust wishes to hurry on to the injury of another, knowing <i>that</i> <a name="fr_1450"></a><a href="#fn_1450"><font size="1">1451</font></a>
 the wicked one can destroy the wicked, for he has received power over them from the beginning.  And not yet is this an evil to those who have done evil; but that their souls should remain punished after the destruction, you are right in thinking to be really harsh, though the man who has been fore-ordained for evil should say that it is right. <a name="fr_1451"></a><a href="#fn_1451"><font size="1">1452</font></a>
   Wherefore, as I said, we ought to avoid doing injury <a name="fr_1452"></a><a href="#fn_1452"><font size="1">1453</font></a>
  to another for the sake of a short lived pleasure, that we may not involve ourselves in eternal punishment for the sake of a little pleasure.”  And Simon said:  “Is it the case, then, that there is nothing either bad or good by nature, but the difference arises through law and custom?  <i>For is it not</i> <a name="fr_1453"></a><a href="#fn_1453"><font size="1">1454</font></a>
  the habit of the Persians to marry their own mothers, sisters and daughters, while marriage with other women is prohibited <a name="fr_1454"></a><a href="#fn_1454"><font size="1">1455</font></a>
  as most barbarous?  Wherefore, if it is not settled what things are evil, it is not possible for all to look forward to the judgment of God.”  And Peter said:  “This cannot hold; for it is plain to all that cohabitation with mothers is abominable, even though the Persians, who are a mere fraction of the whole, should under the effects of a bad custom fail to see the iniquity of their abominable conduct.  Thus also the Britons publicly cohabit in the sight of all, and are not ashamed; and some men eat the flesh of others, and feel no disgust; and others eat the flesh of dogs; and others practice other unmentionable deeds.  Thus, then we ought not to form our judgments with a perception which through habit has been perverted from its natural action.  For to be murdered is an evil, even if all were to deny it; for no one wishes to suffer it himself, and in the case of theft <a name="fr_1455"></a><a href="#fn_1455"><font size="1">1456</font></a>
  no one rejoices at his own punishment.  If, then, no one <a name="fr_1456"></a><a href="#fn_1456"><font size="1">1457</font></a>
  were at all ever to confess that these are sins, it is right even then to look forward of necessity to a judgment in regard to sins.”  When Peter said this, Simon answered:  “Does this, then, seem to you to be the truth in regard to the wicked one?  Tell me.”</p>
