 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvii-p2"></a>To this, I replied:  “I remember, Peter, that you told me of the first man that he was a prophet; but you did not say that he was anointed.  If then there be no prophet without anointing, how could the first man be a prophet, since he was not anointed?”  Then Peter, smiling, said:  “If the first man prophesied, it is certain that he was also anointed.  For although he who has recorded the law in his pages is silent as to his anointing, yet he has evidently left us to understand these things.  For as, if he had said that he was anointed, it would not be doubted that he was also a prophet, although it were not written in the law; so, since it is certain that he was a prophet, it is in like manner certain that he was also anointed, because without anointing he could not be a prophet.  But you should rather have said, If the chrism was compounded by Aaron, by the perfumers art, how could the first man be anointed before Aarons time, the arts of composition not yet having been discovered?”  Then I answered, “Do not misunderstand me, Peter; for I do not speak of that compounded ointment and temporal oil, but of that simple and eternal <i>ointment</i>, which you told me was made by God, after whose likeness you say that that other was compounded by men.”</p>
