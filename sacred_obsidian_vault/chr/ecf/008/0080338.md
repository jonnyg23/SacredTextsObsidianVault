 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></a>“But to these things the serpent answers us with another mouth, and says:  If God did not wish these things to be, then they should not be.  I am not telling you how it is that many contrary things are permitted to be in this world for the probation of every ones mind.  But this is what is suitable to be said in the meantime:  If, according to you, everything that was to be worshipped ought not to have been, there would have been almost nothing in this world.  For what is there that you have left without worshipping it?  The sun, the moon, the stars, the water, the earth, mountains, trees, stones, men; there is no one of these that ye have not worshipped.  According to your saying, therefore, none of these ought to have been made by God, that you might not have anything that you could worship!  Yea, He ought not even to have made men themselves to be the worshippers!  But this is the very thing which that serpent which lurks within you desires:  for he spares none of you; he would have no one of you escape from destruction.  But it shall not be so.  For I tell you, that not that which is worshipped is in fault, but he who worships.  For with God is righteous judgment; and He judges in one way the sufferer, and in another way the doer, of wrong.</p>
