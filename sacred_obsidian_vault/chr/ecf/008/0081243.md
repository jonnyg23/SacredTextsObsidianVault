 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.viii-p2"></a>And a few days thereafter, a boy in that town was splitting wood, and struck his foot.  And a great crowd went to him, and Jesus too went with them.  And He touched the foot which had been hurt, and immediately it was made whole.  And Jesus said to him:  Rise, and split the wood, and remember me.  And when the crowd saw the miracles that were done by Him, they adored Jesus, and said:  Indeed we most surely believe that Thou art God.</p>
