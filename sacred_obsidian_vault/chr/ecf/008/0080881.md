 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-p2"></a>“If, therefore, ye wish to be the vesture of the Divine Spirit, hasten first to put off your base presumption, which is an unclean spirit and a <a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-Page_275"></a>foul garment.  And this you cannot otherwise put off, than by being first baptized in good works.  And thus being pure in body and in soul, you shall enjoy the future eternal kingdom.  Therefore neither believe in idols, nor partake with them of the impure table, nor commit murder, nor adultery, nor hate those whom it is not right to hate, nor steal, nor set upon any evil deeds; since, being deprived of the hope of future blessings in the present life, you shall be subjected to evil demons and terrible sufferings, and in the world to come you shall be punished with eternal fire.  Now, then, what has been said is enough for to-day.  For the rest, those of you who are afflicted with ailments remain for healing; and of the others, you who please go in peace.”</p>
