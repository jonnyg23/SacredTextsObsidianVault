 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xvi-p2"></a>And on the sixth day they entered Bethlehem, where they spent the seventh day.  And on the eighth day they circumcised the child, and called His name Jesus; for so He was called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. <a name="fr_1646"></a><a href="#fn_1646"><font size="1">1647</font></a>
   Now, after the days of the purification of Mary were fulfilled according to the law of Moses, then Joseph took the infant to the temple of the Lord.  And when the infant had received parhithomus, <a name="fr_1647"></a><a href="#fn_1647"><font size="1">1648</font></a>
 —parhithomus, that is, circumcision—they offered for Him a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. <a name="fr_1648"></a><a href="#fn_1648"><font size="1">1649</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xvi-p6"></a>Now there was in the temple a man of God, perfect and just, whose name was Symeon, a hundred and twelve years old.  He had received the answer from the Lord, that he should not taste of death till he had seen Christ, the Son of God, living in the flesh.  And having seen the child, he cried out with a loud voice, saying:  God hath visited His people, and the Lord hath fulfilled His promise.  And he made haste, and adored Him.  And after this he took Him up into his cloak and kissed His feet, and said:  Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word:  for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples, to be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel. <a name="fr_1649"></a><a href="#fn_1649"><font size="1">1650</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xvi-p8"></a>There was also in the temple of the Lord, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity; and she had now been a widow eighty-four years.  And she never left the temple of the Lord, but spent her time in fasting and prayer.  She also likewise adored the child, saying:  In Him is the redemption of the world. <a name="fr_1650"></a><a href="#fn_1650"><font size="1">1651</font></a>
