 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xix-p2"></a>While the woman thus spoke, Peter seemed to be in suspense on account of many reasonings.  But I came up and said, “I have been going about seeking you for a long time.  And now, what is in hand?”  But Peter ordered me to lead the way, and wait for him at the boat; and because there was no gainsaying when he commanded, I did as I was ordered.  But Peter, as he afterwards related the whole matter to me, being struck in his heart with some slight suspicion, inquired of the woman, saying, “Tell me, O woman, your family, and your city, and the names of your children, and presently I shall give you the drug.”  But she, being put under constraint, and not wishing to speak, yet being eager to obtain the drug, cunningly said one thing for another.  And so she said that she was an Ephesian and her husband a Sicilian; and in like manner she changed the names of the three children.  Then Peter, supposing that she spoke the truth, said, “Alas! O woman, I thought that this day was to bring you great joy, suspecting that you are a certain person of whom I was thinking, and whose affairs I have heard and accurately know.”  But she adjured him, saying, “Tell me, I entreat of you, that I may know if there is among women any one more wretched than myself.”</p>
