 <p class="c52"><a name="viii.viii.iii.ii-p2"></a>Of those who ought not to be admitted to the right of accusation.</p> 
 <p class="c21"><a name="viii.viii.iii.ii-p3"></a>On this account, therefore, we decree and resolve, that those who are not of good conversation, or whose life is impeachable, or whose faith and life and liberty are unknown, should not have the power of accusing the priests of the Lord, lest vile persons should thus be admitted to the liberty of accusing them.  In like manner, those who are involved in any matters of accusation, or who are under suspicion, should not have a voice in laying charges against their seniors; for the voice of the suspected and the inimical is wont to oppress the truth.</p>
