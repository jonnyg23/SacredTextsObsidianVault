 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-p2"></a>When therefore Peter had begun to continue his discourse, Simon, interrupting his speech, said:  “Why do you hasten to speak whatever you please?  I understand your tricks.  You wish to bring forward those matters whose explanation you have well studied, that you may appear to the ignorant crowd to be speaking well; but I shall not allow you this subterfuge.  Now therefore, since you promise, as a brave man, to answer to all that any one chooses to bring forward, be pleased to answer me in the first place.”  Then Peter said:  “I am ready, only provided that our discussion may be with peace.”  Then Simon said:  “Do not you see, O simpleton, that in pleading for peace you act in opposition to your Master, and that what you propose is not suitable to him who promises that he will overthrow ignorance?  Or, if you are right in asking peace from the audience, then your Master was wrong in saying, I have not come to send peace on earth, but a sword. <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">619</font></a>
   For either you say well, and he not well; or else, if your Master <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xxvi-Page_105"></a>said well, then you not at all well:  for you do not understand that your statement is contrary to his, whose disciple you profess yourself to be.”</p>
