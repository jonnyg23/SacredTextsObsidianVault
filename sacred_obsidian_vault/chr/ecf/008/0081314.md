 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.xiv-p2"></a>And while they were sitting in the synagogue, and recriminating about Joseph, there came certain of the guards whom they had asked from Pilate to guard the sepulchre of Jesus, lest His disciples coming should steal Him.  And they reported, saying to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, what had happened:  how there had happened a great earthquake, and we saw how an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb, and sat upon it; and his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment like snow.  And for fear, we became as dead.  And we heard the voice of the angel speaking to the women who had come to the sepulchre, and saying, Be not ye afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified:  He is not here; He has risen, as He said:  come and see the place where the Lord was laid.  And go immediately and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead, and will go before you into Galilee, as He said to you.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xiv-p3"></a>The Jews say:  To what women was he speaking?  The soldiers say:  We do not know who the women were.  The Jews say:  At what hour was it?  The guards say:  At midnight.  The Jews say:  And why did you not detain them?  The guards say:  We became as dead from fear of the angel, not hoping now to see the light of day; and how could we detain them?  The Jews says:  <i>As</i> the Lord God liveth, we do not believe you.  And the guards said to the Jews:  You have seen so great signs in that man, and have not believed; and how can you believe us, that the Lord lives?  For well have ye sworn that the Lord Jesus Christ lives.  Again the guards say to the Jews:  we have heard that you have shut up Joseph, who begged the body of Jesus, in the prison, and have sealed it with your rings; and on opening, that you have not found him.  Give us Joseph, then, and we shall give you Jesus Christ.  The Jews said:  Joseph has gone to Arimathea, his own city.  The guards say to the Jews:  And Jesus, as we have heard from the angel, is in Galilee.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xiv-p4"></a>And the Jews, hearing these sayings, feared exceedingly, saying:  Lest at some time or other this saying be heard, and all believe in Jesus.  And the Jews, taking counsel among themselves, brought forth a sufficient number of silver pieces, and gave to the soldiers, saying:  Say that, while we slept, his disciples came and stole him.  And if this be heard by the governor, we shall persuade <a name="fr_1964"></a><a href="#fn_1964"><font size="1">1965</font></a>
  him, and make you secure.  And the soldiers, taking <i>the money</i>, said as they were advised by the Jews; and their saying was spread abroad among all.</p>
