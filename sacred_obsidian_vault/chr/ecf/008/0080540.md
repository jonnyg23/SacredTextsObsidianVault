 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p2"></a>“She therefore (Rhea, or nature), it is said, produced, as it were, a certain bubble which had been collecting for a long time; and it being <a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-Page_201"></a>gradually collected from the spirit which was in the waters, swelled, and being for some time driven over the surface of matter, from which it had come forth as from a womb, and being hardened by the rigour of cold, and always increasing by additions of ice, at length was broken off and sunk into the deep, and drawn by its own weight, went down to the infernal regions; and because it became invisible it was called Aides, and is also named Orcus or Pluto. <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">871</font></a>
   And since it was sunk from the top to the bottom, it gave place to the moist element to flow together; and the grosser part, which is the earth, was laid bare by the retirement of the waters.  They say, therefore, that this freedom of the waters, which was formerly restrained by the presence of the bubble, was called Neptune after the bubble attained the lowest place.  After this, when the cold element had been sucked down to the lower regions by the concretion of the icy bubble, and the dry and the moist element had been separated, there being now no hindrance, the warm element rushed by its force and lightness to the upper regions of the air, being borne up by wind and storm.  This storm, therefore, which in Greek is called <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p3.1"></a>καταιγίς</span>, they called <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxii-p3.2"></a>ægis</span>—that is, a she-goat; and the fire which ascended to the upper regions they called Jupiter; wherefore they say that he ascended to Olympus riding on a she-goat.</p>
