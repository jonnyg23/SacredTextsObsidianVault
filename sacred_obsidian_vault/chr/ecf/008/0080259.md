 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xlix-p2"></a>“For, as I was beginning to say, <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">706</font></a>
  God has appointed for this world certain pairs; and he who comes first of the pairs is of evil, he who comes second, of good.  And in this is given to every man an occasion of right judgment, whether he is simple or prudent.  For if he is simple, and believes him who comes first, though moved thereto by signs and prodigies, he must of necessity, for the same reason, believe him who comes second; for he will be persuaded by signs and prodigies, as he was before.  When he believes this second one, he will learn from him that he ought not to believe the first, who comes of evil; and so the error of the former is corrected by the emendation of the latter.  But if he will not receive the second, because he has believed the first, he will deservedly be condemned as unjust; for unjust it is, that when he believed the first on account of his signs, he will not believe the second, though he bring the same, or even greater signs.  But if he has not believed the first, it follows that he may be moved to believe the second.  For his mind has not become so completely inactive but that it may be roused by the redoubling of marvels.  But if he is prudent, he can make distinction of the signs.  And if indeed he has believed in the first, he will be moved to the second by the increase in the miracles, and by comparison he will apprehend which are better; although clear tests <i>of miracles</i> are recognised by all learned men, as we have shown in the regular order of our discussion.  But if any one, as being whole and not needing a physician, is not moved to the first, he will be drawn to the second by the very continuance of the thing, and will make a distinction of signs and marvels after this fashion;—he who is of <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.v.xlix-Page_130"></a>the evil one, the signs that he works do good to no one; but those which the good man worketh are profitable to men.”</p>
