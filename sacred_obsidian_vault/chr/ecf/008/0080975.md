 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.iv-p2"></a>When, therefore, they had gone, I, Clement, rejoiced greatly that he had ordered me to remain with himself.  Then I answered and said, “I thank God that you have not sent me away as you have done the others, as I should have died of grief.”  But he said, “But what?  If there shall ever be any necessity that you be sent away for the sake of teaching, would you, on account of being separated for a little while from me, and that for an advantageous purpose, would you die for that?  Would you not rather impress upon yourself the duty of bearing the things that are arranged for you through necessity, and cheerfully submit?  And do you not know that friends are present with one another in their memories, although they are separated bodily; whereas some, being bodily present, wander from their friends in their souls, by reason of want of memory?”</p>
