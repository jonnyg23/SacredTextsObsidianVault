 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xxiv-p2"></a>“Nor yet is that in harmony with the illustration of Cæsar, and of the powers under him, to call them administrators; whereas you take all care of them, as I said, tending your images in every respect.  For they, having no power, do nothing.  Wherefore tell us what do they administer? what do they of that sort which rulers in different places do? and what influence do they exert, as the stars of God?  Do they show anything like the sun, or do you light lamps before them?  Are they able to bring showers, as the clouds bring rain,—they which cannot even move themselves, unless men carry them?  Do they make the earth fruitful to your labours, these to whom you supply sacrifices?  Thus they can do nothing.</p>
