 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ii.v-p2"></a>James having thus spoken, the elders were in an agony of terror.  Therefore James, perceiving that they were greatly afraid, said:  “Hear me, brethren and fellow-servants.  If we should give the books to all indiscriminately, and they should be corrupted by any daring men, or be perverted by interpretations, as you have heard that some have already done, it will remain even for those who really seek the truth, always to wander in error.  Wherefore it is better that they should be with us, and that we should communicate them with all the fore-mentioned care to those who wish to live piously, and to save others.  But if any one, after taking this adjuration, shall act otherwise, he shall with good reason incur eternal punishment.  For why should not he who is the cause of the destruction of <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ii.v-Page_217"></a>others not be destroyed himself?”  The elders, therefore, being pleased with the sentiments of James exclaimed, “Blessed be He who, as foreseeing all things, has graciously appointed thee as our bishop;” and when they had said this, we all rose up, and prayed to the Father and God of all, to whom be glory for ever.  Amen. <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">894</font></a>
