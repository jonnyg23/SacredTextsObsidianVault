 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p2"></a>“And others introduce an unforeseeing destiny, as if all things revolved of their own accord, without the superintendence of any master.  But thus to think these things is, as we have said, the most grievous of all opinions.  For, as if there were no one superintending and fore-judging and distributing to every one according to his deserving, they easily do everything as they can through fearlessness.  Therefore those who have such opinions do not easily, or perhaps do not at all, live virtuously; for they do not foresee the danger which might have the effect of converting them.  But the doctrine of the barbarous Jews, as you call them, is most pious, introducing One as the Father and Creator of all this world, by nature good and righteous; good, indeed, as pardoning sins to those who repent; but righteous, as visiting to every one after repentance according to the worthiness of his doings.</p>
