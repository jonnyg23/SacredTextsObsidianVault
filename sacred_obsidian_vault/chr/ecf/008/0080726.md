 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p2"></a>“Therefore also Adam, being made at first after his likeness, is created blind, and is said not to have knowledge of good or evil, and is found a transgressor, and is driven out of paradise, and is punished with death.  In like manner also, he who made him, because he sees not in all places, says with reference to the overthrow of Sodom, Come, and let us go down, and see whether they do according to their cry which comes to me; or if not, that I may know. <a name="fr_979"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">980</font></a>
   Thus he shows himself ignorant.  And in his saying respecting Adam, Let us drive him out, lest he put forth his hand and touch the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever; <a name="fr_980"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">981</font></a>
  in saying <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p4.2"></a>Lest</span> he is ignorant; and in driving him out lest he should eat and live for ever, he is also envious.  And whereas it is written that God repented that he had made man, <a name="fr_981"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">982</font></a>
  this implies both repentance and ignorance.  For this reflection is a view by which one, through ignorance, wishes to inquire into the result of the things which he wills, or it is the act of one repenting on account of the event not being according to his expectation.  And whereas it is written, And the Lord smelled a scent of sweetness, <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">983</font></a>
  it is the part of one in need; and his being pleased with the fat of flesh is the part of one who is not good.  But his tempting, as it is written, And God did tempt Abraham, <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">984</font></a>
  is the part of one who is wicked, and who is ignorant of the issue of the experiment.”</p>
