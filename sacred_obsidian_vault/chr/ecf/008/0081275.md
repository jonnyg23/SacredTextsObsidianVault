 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.v-p2"></a>Pilate therefore, leaving Christ alone, went outside, and says to the Jews:  I find no fault in this man.  The Jews answered:  Let us tell your highness what he said.  He said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days to build it.  Pilate says:  And what temple did he say that he was to destroy?  The Hebrews say:  The temple of Solomon, which Solomon built in forty-six years. <a name="fr_1879"></a><a href="#fn_1879"><font size="1">1880</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.v-p4"></a>Pilate says privately to the chief priests and the scribes and the Pharisees:  I entreat you, do nothing evil against this man; for if you do evil against him, you will do unjustly:  for it is not just that such a man should die, who has done great good to many men.  They said to Pilate:  <a name="page_428"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 428</font></a> <a name="vii.xiii.v-Page_428"></a>If, my lord, he who has dishonoured Cæsar is worthy of death, how much more this <i>man</i> who dishonours God!</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.v-p5"></a>Then Pilate dismissed them, and they all went outside.  Thereupon he says to Jesus:  What dost thou wish that I shall do to thee?  Jesus says to Pilate:  Do to me as is determined.  Pilate says:  How is it determined?  Jesus answered:  Moses and the prophets wrote about me being crucified, and rising again.  The Hebrews, hearing <i>this</i>, said to Pilate:  Why do you seek to hear a greater insult out of him against God?  Pilate says:  These words are not an insult against God, since they are written in the books of the prophets.  The Hebrews said:  Our Scripture says, If a man offend against a man, that is to say, if he insult him, he is worthy to receive forty strokes with a rod; but if any one insult God, to be stoned. <a name="fr_1880"></a><a href="#fn_1880"><font size="1">1881</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.v-p7"></a>Then came a messenger from Procle, the wife of Pilate, to him; and the message said:  Take care that thou do not agree that any evil should happen to Jesus the good man; because during this night I have seen fearful dreams on account of him. <a name="fr_1881"></a><a href="#fn_1881"><font size="1">1882</font></a>
   And Pilate spoke to the Hebrews, saying:  If you hold as insult against God the words which you declare Jesus to have spoken, take and judge him yourselves according to your law. <a name="fr_1882"></a><a href="#fn_1882"><font size="1">1883</font></a>
   The Jews said to Pilate:  We wish that you should crucify him.  Pilate says:  This is not good.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.v-p10"></a>And Pilate, turning towards the people, saw many weeping, and said:  To me it seems that it is not the wish of all the people that this man should die.  The priests and the scribes say:  We on this account have brought all the people, that thou mightst have full conviction that all wish his death.  Pilate says:  For what evil hath he done?  The Hebrews said:  He says that he is a king, and the Son of God.</p>
