 <p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.ii-p3"></a>Founding of the town of Edessa; brief account of the race of our illuminator.</p> 
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.ii-p4"></a>A little while afterwards, Augustus dies, and Tiberius becomes emperor of the Romans in his stead.  Germanicus, having become Cæsar, dragging in his train the princes of the kingdom of Archavir and of Abgar, celebrates a triumph in respect of the war waged with them, in which these princes had killed Herods nephew.  Abgar, indignant, forms plans of revolt and prepares himself for combat.  He builds a town on the ground occupied by the Armenian army of observation, where previously the Euphrates had been defended against the attempts of Cassius:  this new town is called Edessa.  Abgar removed to it his court, which was at Medzpine, all his gods, Naboc, Bel, Patnicagh, and Tarata, the books of the schools attached to the temples, and even the royal archives.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.ii-p5"></a>After this, Archavir being dead, Ardachès, his son, reigns over the Persians.  Though it is not in the order of the history with respect to time, nor even the order according to which we have begun these annals, yet, as we are treating of descendants of the king Archavir, even of the blood of Ardachès his son, we will, to do honour to these princes, place them, by anticipating the time, near to Ardachès, in order that the reader may know that they are of the same race, of the race of the brave Archag; then we will indicate the time of the arrival of their fathers in Armenia, the Garenians and the Sourenians, from whom St. Gregory and the Gamsa<a name="page_703"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 703</font></a> <a name="ix.xiii.ii-Page_703"></a>rians are descended, when, following the order of events, we come to the reign of the king under whom they appeared.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.ii-p6"></a>Abgar did not succeed in his plans of revolt; for, troubles having arisen amongst his relatives in the Persian kingdom, he set out at the head of an army to allay and bring to an end the dissension.</p>
