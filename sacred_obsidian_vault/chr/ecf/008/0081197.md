 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xx-p2"></a>Lions and panthers adored Him likewise, and accompanied them in the desert.  Wherever Joseph and the blessed Mary went, they went before them showing them the way, and bowing their heads; and showing their submission by wagging their tails, they adored Him with great reverence.  Now at first, when Mary saw the lions and the panthers, and various kinds of wild beasts, coming about them, she was very much afraid.  But the infant Jesus looked into her face with a joyful countenance, and said:  Be not afraid, mother; for they come not to do thee harm, but they make haste to serve both thee and me.  With these words He drove all fear from her heart.  And the lions kept walking with them, and with the oxen, and the asses, and the beasts of burden which carried their baggage, and did not hurt a single one of them, though they kept beside them; but they were tame among the sheep and the rams which they had brought with them from Judæa, and which they had with them.  They walked among wolves, and feared nothing; and no one of them was hurt by another.  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet:  Wolves shall feed with lambs; the lion and the ox shall eat straw together. <a name="fr_1661"></a><a href="#fn_1661"><font size="1">1662</font></a>
   There were together two oxen drawing a waggon with provision for the journey, and the lions directed them in their path.</p>
