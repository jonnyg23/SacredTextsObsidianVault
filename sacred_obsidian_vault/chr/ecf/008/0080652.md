 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xix-p2"></a>“There is amongst us one Justa, a Syro-Phœnician, by race a Canaanite, whose daughter was oppressed with a grievous disease. <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">927</font></a>
   And she came to our Lord, crying out, and entreating that He would heal her daughter.  But He, being asked also by us, said, It is not lawful to heal the Gentiles, who are like to dogs on account of their using various <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">928</font></a>
  meats and practices, while the table in the kingdom has been given to the sons of Israel.  But she, hearing this, and begging to partake like a dog of the crumbs that fall from this table, having changed what she was, <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">929</font></a>
  by living like the sons of the kingdom, she obtained healing for her daughter, as she asked.  For she being a Gentile, and remaining in the same course of life, He would not have healed had she remained a Gentile, on account of its not being lawful to heal her as a Gentile. <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">930</font></a>
