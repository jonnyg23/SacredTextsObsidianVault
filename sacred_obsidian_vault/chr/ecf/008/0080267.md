 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lvii-p2"></a>When he had given them these and such like precepts, he made proclamation to the people, saying:  “Since I have resolved to stay three months with you, if any one desires it, let him be baptized; that, stripped of his former evils, he may for the future, in consequence of his own conduct, become heir of heavenly blessings, as a reward for his good actions.  Whosoever will, then, let him come to Zacchæus and give his name to him, and let him hear from him the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.  Let him attend to frequent fastings, and approve himself in all things, that at the end of these three months he may be baptized on the day of the festival.  But every one of you shall be baptized in ever flowing waters, the name of the Trine Beatitude being invoked over him; he being first anointed with oil sanctified by prayer, that so at length, being consecrated by these things, he may attain a perception of holy things.” <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">713</font></a>
