 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xlvi-p2"></a>“This is our Judge, to whom it behoves us to look. and to regulate our own souls, thinking all things in His favour, speaking well of Him, persuaded that by His long-suffering He brings to light the obstinacy of all, and is alone good.  And He, at the end of all, shall sit as a just Judge upon every one of those who have attempted what they ought not.”</p>
