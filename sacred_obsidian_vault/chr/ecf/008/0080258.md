 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xlviii-p2"></a>Then said Peter:  “I take it well that you bring the truth to the rule, and do not suffer hindrances of faith to lurk in your soul.  For thus you can easily obtain the remedy.  Do you remember that I said, that the worst of all things is when any one neglects to learn what is for his good?”  Niceta answered:  “I remember.”  Then Peter:  “And again, that God has veiled His truth, that He may disclose it to those who faithfully follow Him?”  “Neither,” said Niceta, “have I forgotten this.”  Then said Peter:  “What think you then?  That God has buried His truth deep in the earth, and has heaped mountains upon it, that it may be found by those only who are able to dig down into the depths?  It is not so; but as He has surrounded the mountains and the earth with the expanse of heaven, so hath He veiled the truth with the curtain of His own love, that he alone may be able to reach it, who has first knocked at the gate of divine love.</p>
