 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p2"></a>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole earth; and the sun was obscured, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.  And crying out with a loud voice, He said:  Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.  And thus saying, He gave up the ghost.  And the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying:  This was a just man.  And all the people who were present at that spectacle, seeing what was done, beating their breasts, returned.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p3"></a>And the centurion reported to the governor what was done.  And the governor and his wife hearing, were very sorrowful, and neither ate nor drank that day.  And Pilate, calling together the Jews, said to them:  Have you seen what has been done?  And they said to the governor:  There has been an eclipse of the sun, as is usual.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p4"></a>And his acquaintances also stood afar off, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee, seeing these things.  And lo, a certain man, by name Joseph, holding office, a man good and just, who did not consent to their counsels nor their deeds, from Arimathæa, <a name="fr_1962"></a><a href="#fn_1962"><font size="1">1963</font></a>
  a city of the Jews, waiting, he also, for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.  And taking Him down from the cross, he wrapped Him in clean linen, and laid Him in his own new tomb, in which no one had been laid.</p>
