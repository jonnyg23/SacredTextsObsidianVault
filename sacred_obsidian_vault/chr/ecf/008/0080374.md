 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.vii-p2"></a>But I trembled when I heard this, and my tears immediately gushed forth, because so great a man, who is worth more than the whole world, had addressed such a proposal to me.  Then he, when he saw me weeping, inquired the reason; and I answered him:  “How have I so sinned against you, that you should distress me with such a proposal?”  Then Peter:  “If it is evil that I said I should serve you, you were first in fault in saying the same thing to me.”  Then said I:  “The cases are not alike:  for it becomes me to do this to you; but it is grievous that you, who are sent as the herald of the Most High God to save the souls of men, should say it to me.”  Then said Peter:  “I should agree with you, were it not that our Lord, who came for the salvation of the whole world, and who was nobler than any creature, submitted to be a servant, that He might persuade us not to be ashamed to perform the ministry of servants to our brethren.”  Then said I:  “It were foolishness in me to suppose that I can prevail with you; nevertheless I give thanks to the providence of God, because I have merited to have you instead of parents.”</p>
