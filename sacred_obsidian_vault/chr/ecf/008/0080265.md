 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lv-p2"></a>“Be not, my brethren, distressed by those things that have been done, but give heed to the future:  for what is passed is ended; but the things which threaten are dangerous to those who shall fall in with them.  For offences shall never be wanting in this world, <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">711</font></a>
  so long as the enemy is permitted to act according to his will; in order that the prudent and those who understood his wiles may be conquerors in the contests which he raises against them; but that those who neglect to learn the things that pertain to the salvation of their souls, may be taken by him with merited deceptions.  Since, therefore, as you have heard, Simon has gone forth to preoccupy the ears of the Gentiles who are called to salvation, it is necessary that I also follow upon his track, so that whatever disputations he raises may be corrected by us.  But inasmuch as it is right that greater anxiety should be felt concerning you who are already received within the walls of life,—for if that which has been actually acquired perish, a positive loss is sustained; while with respect to that which has not yet been acquired, if it can be got, there is so much gain; but if not, the only loss is that there is no gain;—in order, therefore, that you may be more and more confirmed in the truth, and the nations who are called to salvation may in no way be prevented by the wickedness of Simon, I have thought good to ordain Zacchæus as pastor over you, <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">712</font></a>
  and to remain with you myself for three months; and so to go to the Gentiles, lest through our delaying longer, and the crimes of Simon stalking in every direction, they should become incurable.”</p>
