 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xix-p2"></a>Then Peter, when he heard me speak thus, said:  “I give thanks to my God, both for your salvation and for my own peace; for I am greatly delighted to see that you have understood what is the greatness of the prophetic virtue, and because, as you say, not even I myself, if I should wish it (which God forbid!), should be able to turn you away to another faith.  Now henceforth begin to be with us, and to-morrow be present at our discussions, for I am to have a contest with Simon the magician.”  When he had thus spoken, he retired to take food along with his friends; but he ordered me to eat by myself; <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">541</font></a>
  and after the meal, when he had sung praise to God and given thanks, he rendered to me an account of this proceeding, and added, “May the Lord grant to thee to be made like to us in all things, that, receiving baptism, thou mayest be able to meet with us at the same table.”  Having thus spoken, he ordered me to go to rest, for by this time both fatigue and the time of the day called to sleep.</p>
