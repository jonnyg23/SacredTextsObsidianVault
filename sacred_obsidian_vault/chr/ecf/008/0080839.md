 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xxi-p2"></a>“For instance, as I have mentioned already, in the Caucasian mountains there is shown the tomb of a certain Kronos, a man, and a fierce monarch who slew his children.  And the son of this man, called Zeus, became worse <i>than his father;</i> and having by the power of magic been declared ruler of the universe, he committed many adulteries, and inflicted punishment on his father and uncles, and so died; and the Cretans show his tomb.  And in Mesopotamia there lie buried a certain Helios at Atir, and a certain Selene at Carrhæ.  A certain Hermes, a man, lies buried in Egypt; Ares in Thrace; Aphrodite in Cyprus; Æsculapius in Epidaurus; and the tombs of many other such persons are to be seen. <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">1077</font></a>
