 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.xxxiii-p2"></a>“Is it, then, that we are of another and a superior nature, and that therefore the demons are afraid of us?  Nay, we are of one and the same nature with you, but we differ in religion.  But if you will also be <i>like us,</i> we do not grudge it, but rather we exhort you, and wish you to be assured, that when the same faith and religion and innocence of life shall be in you that is in us, you will have equal and the same power and virtue against demons, through God rewarding your faith.  For as he who has soldiers under him, although he may be inferior, and they superior to him in strength, yet says to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to another, Do this, and he doeth it; <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">743</font></a>
  and this he is able to do, not by his own power, but by the fear of Cæsar; so every faithful one commands the demons, although they seem to be much stronger than men, and that not by means of his own power, but by means of the power of God, who has put them in subjection.  For even that which we have just spoken of, that Cæsar is held in awe by all soldiers, and in every camp, and in his whole kingdom, though he is but one man, and perhaps feeble in respect of bodily strength, this is not effected but by the power of God, who inspires all with fear, that they may be subject to one.</p>
