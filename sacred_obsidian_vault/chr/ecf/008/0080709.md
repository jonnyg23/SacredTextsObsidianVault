 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxii-p2"></a>“But a companion was created along with him, a female nature, much differing from him, as quality from substance, as the moon from the sun, as fire from light.  She, as a female ruling the present world as her like, <a name="fr_965"></a><a href="#fn_965"><font size="1">966</font></a>
  was entrusted to be the first prophetess, announcing prophecy with all amongst those born of woman. <a name="fr_966"></a><a href="#fn_966"><font size="1">967</font></a>
   But the other, as the son of man, being a male, prophesies better things to the world to come as a male.</p>
