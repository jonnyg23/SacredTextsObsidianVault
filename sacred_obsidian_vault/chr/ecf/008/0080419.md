 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiii-p2"></a>“Now, in the meantime, that this visible world has been made, very many wise men among the philosophers do testify.  But that we may not seem to make use of assertions as witnesses, as though we needed them, let us inquire, if you please, concerning its principles.  That this visible world is material, is sufficiently evident from the fact that it is visible.  But every body receives <i>one of</i> two <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiii-p2.1"></a>Differentiæ</span>; for it is either compact and solid, or divided and separate.  And if the body of which the world was made was compact and solid, and that body was parted and divided through diverse species and parts according to its differences, there must necessarily be understood to have been some one to separate the body which was compact and solid, and to draw it into many parts and diverse forms; or if all this mass of the world was compounded and compacted from diverse and dispersed parts of bodies, still there must be understood to have been some one to collect into one the dispersed parts, and to invest these things with their different species.</p>
