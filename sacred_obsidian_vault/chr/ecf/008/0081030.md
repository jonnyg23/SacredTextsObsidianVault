 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.iii-p2"></a>“The old man began to speak as follows:  When I saw you after you had bathed in the sea retire into the secret place, I went up and secretly watched what might be your object in entering into a secret place, and when I saw you pray, I retired; <a name="fr_1194"></a><a href="#fn_1194"><font size="1">1195</font></a>
  but taking pity on you, I waited that I might speak with you when you came out, and prevail on you not to be led astray.  For there is neither God nor providence; but all things are subject to Genesis. <a name="fr_1195"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">1196</font></a>
   Of this I am fully assured in consequence of what I have myself endured, having for a long time made a careful study of the science. <a name="fr_1196"></a><a href="#fn_1196"><font size="1">1197</font></a>
   Do not therefore be deceived, my child.  For whether you pray or not, you must endure what is assigned to you by Genesis.  For if prayers could have <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xvii.iii-Page_306"></a>done anything or any good, I myself should now be in better circumstances.  And now, unless my needy garments mislead you, you will not refuse to believe what I say.  I was once in affluent circumstances; I sacrificed much to the gods, I gave liberally to the needy; and yet, though I prayed and acted piously, I was not able to escape my destiny.  And I said:  What are the calamities you have endured?  And he answered:  I need not tell you now; perhaps at the end you shall learn who I am, and who are my parents, and into what straitened circumstances I have fallen.  But at present I wish you to become fully assured that everything is subject to Genesis.</p>
