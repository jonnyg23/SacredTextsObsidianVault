 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2"></a>“But I shall give a still stronger proof of the matters in hand.  For, behold, scarcely seven years have yet passed since the advent of the righteous and true Prophet; and in the course of these, men of all nations coming to Judæa, and moved both by the signs and miracles which they saw, and by the grandeur of His doctrine, received His faith; and then going back to their own countries, they rejected the lawless rites of the Gentiles, and their incestuous marriages.  In short, among the Parthians—as Thomas, who is preaching the Gospel amongst them, has written to us—not many now are addicted to polygamy; nor among the Medes do many throw their dead to dogs; nor are the Persians pleased with intercourse with their mothers, or incestuous marriages with their daughters; nor do the Susian women practise the adulteries that were allowed them; nor has <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span> been able to force those into crimes whom the teaching of religion restrained.</p>
