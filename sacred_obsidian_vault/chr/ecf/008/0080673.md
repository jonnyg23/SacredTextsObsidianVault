 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xl-p2"></a>“Everything that is spoken or written against God is false.  But that we say this truly, not only for the sake of reputation, but for the sake of truth, I shall convince you when my discourse has proceeded a little further.  Whence you, my most beloved Clement, ought not to be sorry at Simons having interposed a day between this and the discussion.  For to-day, before the discussion, you shall be instructed concerning the chapters added to the Scriptures; and then in the discussion concerning the only one and good God, the Maker also of the world, you ought not to be distracted.  But in the discussion you will even wonder how impious men, overlooking the multitudes of things that are spoken in the Scriptures for God, and looking at those that are spoken against Him, gladly bring these forward; and thus the hearers, by reason of ignorance, believing the things against God, become outcasts from His kingdom.  Wherefore you, by advantage of the postponement, learning the mystery of the Scriptures, and gaining the <i>means of</i> not sinning against God, will incomparably rejoice.”</p>
