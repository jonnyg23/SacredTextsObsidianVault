 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></a>But it plainly appeared to me that he was disconcerted.  For when I said to him, “Only set forth to me the words which you have heard of the Man who has appeared, and I will adorn them with my speech, and preach the counsel of God; and if you do so, within a few days I will sail with you, for I greatly desire to go to the land of Judæa, and perhaps I shall dwell with you all my life;”—when he heard this, he answered:  “If you wish to inquire into our affairs, and to learn what is for your advantage, sail with me at once.  But if you will not, I shall now give you directions to my house, and that of those whom you wish <i>to meet</i>, that when you choose to come you may find us.  For I shall set out to-morrow for my home.”  And when I saw that he could not be prevailed upon, I went with him as far as the harbour; and having learned of him the directions which he had promised to give me for finding the dwellings, I said to him, “Were it not that to-morrow I am to recover a debt that is due to me, I should straightway set sail with you.  But I shall soon overtake you.”  And having said this, and having given him in charge to those who commanded the ship, I returned grieving, remembering him as an excellent and dear friend.</p>
