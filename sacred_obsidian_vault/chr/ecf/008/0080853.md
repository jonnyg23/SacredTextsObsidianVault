 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.viii-p2"></a>“And this is the service He has appointed:  To worship Him only, and trust only in the Prophet of truth, and to be baptized for the remission of sins, and thus by this pure baptism to be born again unto God by saving water; to abstain from the table of devils, that is, from food offered to idols, from dead carcases, from animals which have been suffocated or caught by wild beasts, and from blood; <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">1084</font></a>
  not to live any longer impurely; to wash after intercourse; that the women on their part should keep the law of purification; that all should be sober-minded, given to good works, refraining from wrongdoing, looking for eternal life from the all-powerful God, and asking with prayer and continual supplication that they may win it.”  Such was Peters counsel to the men of Sidon also.  And in few days many repented and believed, and were healed.  And Peter having founded a church, and set over it as bishop one of the elders who were with him, left Sidon.</p>
