 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xix-p2"></a>“When <i>you are</i> with these in Antioch, while you look like Simon, proclaim publicly your <i>repentance</i>, saying, I Simon proclaim this to you:  I confess <a name="fr_1534"></a><a href="#fn_1534"><font size="1">1535</font></a>
  that all my statements in regard to Peter are <i>utterly false;</i> <a name="fr_1535"></a><a href="#fn_1535"><font size="1">1536</font></a>
 <i>for he is not</i> a deceiver, nor a murderer, nor a juggler; nor are any of the evil things true which I, urged on by wrath, said previously in regard to him.  I myself therefore beg of you, I who have been the cause of your hatred to him, cease from hating him; for he is the true apostle of the true Prophet that was sent by God for the salvation of the world.  Wherefore also I counsel you to believe what he preaches; <a name="fr_1536"></a><a href="#fn_1536"><font size="1">1537</font></a>
  for if you do not, your whole city will be utterly destroyed.  Now I wish you to know for what reason I have made this confession to you.  This night angels of God scourged me, the impious one, terribly, as being an enemy to the herald of the truth.  I beseech you, therefore, do not listen to me, even if I myself should come at another time and attempt to say anything against Peter.  For I confess to you I am a magician, I am a deceiver, I am a juggler.  Yet perhaps it is possible for me by repentance to wipe out the sins which were formerly committed by me.”</p>
