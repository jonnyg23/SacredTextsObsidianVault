 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.vi-p2"></a>And as Peter entered Sidon, they brought many in couches, and laid them before him.  And he said to them:  “Think not, I pray you, that I can do anything to heal you, who am a mortal man, myself subject to many evils.  But I shall not refuse to show you the way in which you must be saved.  For I have learned from the Prophet of truth the conditions fore-ordained of God before the foundation of the world; that is to say, the evil deeds which if men do He has ordained that they shall be injured by the prince of evil, and in like manner the good deeds for which He has decreed that they who have believed in Him as their Physician shall have their bodies made whole, and their souls established in safety.</p>
