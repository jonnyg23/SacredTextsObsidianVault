 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p2"></a>And when he had said this, and more to the same purpose, and had cured some who were present who were infirm and possessed of de<a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-Page_206"></a>mons, he dismissed the crowds, while they gave thanks and praised God, charging them to come to the same place on the following days also for the sake of hearing.  And when we were together at home, and were preparing to eat, one entering told us that Appion Pleistonices, <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">881</font></a>
  with Anubion, were lately come from Antioch, and were lodging with Simon. <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">882</font></a>
   Then my father, when he heard this, rejoiced, and said to Peter:  “If you permit me, I should like to go and salute Appion and Anubion, for they are great friends of mine; and perhaps I shall be able to persuade Anubion to dispute with Clement on the subject of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4.1"></a>Genesis</span>.”  Then Peter said:  “I consent; and I commend you, because you respect your friends.  But consider how all things occur to you according to your wish by Gods providence; for, behold, not only have <i>the objects</i> <i>of</i> proper affection been restored to you by the appointment of God, but also the presence of your friends is arranged for you.”  Then said my father:  “Truly I consider that it is so as you say.”  And when he had said this, he went away to Anubion.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p3"></a> The name is generally written Apion.  The meaning of Pleistonices is doubtful, some supposing that it indicates his birthplace, some his father; but generally it is taken as an epithet, and it will then refer to his frequent victories in literary contests.  [See Homily IV. 3, and the discussions with Appion which follow in that homily and in V., VI.—R.]</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4"></a> [From this point the resemblance to the close of Homily XX. (chaps. 11–22) is quite marked.  But in the <i>Recognitions</i> the conclusion is more detailed and complete; see chap. 65.  This is in accordance with the general design of this narrative, which gives greater prominence to the family of Clement.—R.]</p>
