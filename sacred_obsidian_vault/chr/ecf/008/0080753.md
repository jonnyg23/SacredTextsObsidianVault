 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxvi-p2"></a>“And your work is to order what things are proper; and that of the brethren is to submit, and not to disobey.  Therefore submitting they shall be saved, but disobeying they shall be punished by the Lord, because the president is entrusted with the place of Christ.  Wherefore, indeed, honour or contempt shown to the president is handed on to Christ, and from Christ to God.  And this I have said, that these brethren may not be ignorant of the danger they incur by disobedience to you, because whosoever disobeys your orders, disobeys Christ; and he who disobeys Christ offends God.</p>
