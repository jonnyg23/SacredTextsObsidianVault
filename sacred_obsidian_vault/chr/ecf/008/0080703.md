 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xvi-p2"></a>“However, there are many proclaimers of error, having one chief, even the chief of wickedness, just as the Prophet of truth, being one, and being also the chief of piety, shall in His own times have as His prophets all who are found pure.  But the chief cause of men being deceived is this, their not understanding beforehand the doctrine of conjunction, which I shall not fail to expound to you in private every day, summarily; for it were too long to speak in detail.  Be you therefore to me truth-loving judges of the things that are spoken.</p>
