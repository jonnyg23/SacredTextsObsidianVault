 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ii.ii-p2"></a>In order, therefore, that the like may also happen to those among us as to these Seventy, give the books of my preachings to our brethren, with the like mystery of initiation, that they may indoctrinate those who wish to take part in teaching; for if it be not so done, our word of truth will be rent into many opinions.  And this I know, not as being a prophet, but as already seeing the beginning of this very evil.  For some from among the Gentiles have rejected my legal preaching, attaching themselves to certain lawless and trifling preaching of the man who is my enemy. <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">890</font></a>
   And these things some have attempted while I am still alive, to transform my words by certain various interpretations, in order to the dissolution of the law; as though I also myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which God forbid!  For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of God which was spoken by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its eternal continuance; for thus he spoke:  “The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.” <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">891</font></a>
   And this He has said, that all things might come to pass.  But these men, professing, I know not how, to know my mind, undertake to explain my words, which they have heard of me, more intelligently than I who spoke them, telling their catechumens that this is my meaning, which indeed I never thought of.  But if, while I am still alive, they dare thus to misrepresent me, how much more will those who shall come after me dare to do so!</p>
