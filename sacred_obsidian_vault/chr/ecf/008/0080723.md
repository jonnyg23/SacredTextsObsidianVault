 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxvi-p2"></a>“Therefore, if any one shall accurately scan the whole with reason, he shall find that God has made them for the sake of man.  For showers fall for the sake of fruits, that man may partake of them, and that animals may be fed, that they may be useful to men.  And the sun shines, that he may turn the air into four seasons, and that each time may afford its peculiar service to man.  And the fountains spring, that drink may be given to men.  And, moreover, who is lord over the creatures, so far as is possible?  Is it not man, who has received wisdom to till the earth, to sail the sea:  to make fishes, birds, and beasts his prey; to investigate the course of the stars, to mine the earth, to sail the sea; to build cities, to define kingdoms, to ordain laws, to execute justice, to know the invisible God, to be cognizant of the names of angels, to drive away demons, to endeavour to cure diseases by medicines, to find charms against poison-darting serpents, to understand antipathies?</p>
