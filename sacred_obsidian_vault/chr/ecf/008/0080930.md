 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xxiii-p2"></a>“Nay, it will be said; but they are detected by their foresight.  It is false; for how many of them have not been detected?  And if on account of the capture of some it be said that they have power, it is a mistake.  For of those who rob tombs, some are found out and some escape; but it is not by the power of the dead that those who are apprehended are detected.  And such ought to be our conclusion with respect to those who steal and pilfer the gods.  But it will be said, The gods that are in them take no care of their images.  Why, then, do you tend them, wiping them, and washing them, and scouring them, crowning them, and sacrificing to them?  Wherefore agree with me that you act altogether without right reason.  For as you lament over the dead, so you sacrifice and make libations to your gods.</p>
