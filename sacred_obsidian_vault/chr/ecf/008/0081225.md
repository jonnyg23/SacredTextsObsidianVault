 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.iv-p2"></a>Thereafter he appeared to Anna his wife, saying:  Fear not, Anna, nor think that it is a phantom which thou seest.  For I am that angel who has presented your prayers and alms before God; and now have I been sent to you to announce to you that thou shalt bring forth a daughter, who shall be called Mary, and who shall be blessed above all women.  She, full of the favour of the Lord even from her birth, shall remain three years in her fathers house until she be weaned.  Thereafter, being delivered to the service of the Lord, she shall not depart from the temple until she reach the years of discretion.  There, in fine, serving God day and night in fastings and prayers, she shall abstain from every unclean thing; she shall never know man, but alone, without example, immaculate, uncorrupted, without intercourse with man, she, a virgin, shall bring forth a son; she, His hand-maiden, shall bring forth the Lord—both in grace, and in name, and in work, the Saviour of the world.  Wherefore arise, and go up to Jerusalem; and when thou shalt come to the gate which, because it is plated with gold, is called Golden, there, for a sign, thou shalt meet thy husband, for whose safety thou hast been anxious.  And when these things shall have so happened, know that what I announce shall without doubt be fulfilled.</p>
