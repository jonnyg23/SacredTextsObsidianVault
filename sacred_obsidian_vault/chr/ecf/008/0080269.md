 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lix-p2"></a>Having therefore separated me, Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, he said to those twelve:  “I wish you the day after to-morrow to proceed to the Gentiles, and to follow in the footsteps of Simon, that you may inform me of all his proceedings.  You will also inquire diligently the sentiments of every one, and announce to them that I shall come to them without delay; and, in short, in all places instruct the Gentiles to expect my coming.”  When he had spoken these things, and others to the same effect, he said:  “You also, my brethren, if you have anything to say to these things, say on, lest haply it be not right which seems good to me alone.”  Then all, with one voice applauding him, said:  “We ask you rather to arrange everything according to your own judgment, and to order what seems good to yourself; for this we think to be the perfect work of piety, if we fulfil what you command.”</p>
