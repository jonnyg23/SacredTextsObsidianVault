 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lviii-p2"></a>“And, behold, one of the scribes, shouting out from the midst of the people, says:  The signs and miracles which your Jesus wrought, he wrought not as a prophet, but as a magician.  Him Philip eagerly encounters, showing that by this argument he accused Moses also.  For when Moses wrought signs and miracles in Egypt, in like manner as Jesus also did in Judæa, it cannot be doubted that what was said of Jesus might as well be said of Moses.  Having made these and such like protestations, Philip was silent.”</p>
