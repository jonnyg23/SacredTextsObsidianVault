 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lx-p2"></a>“Since, therefore, it is necessary to set apart some one instead of me to fill my place, let us all with one consent pray to God, that He would make manifest who amongst us is the best, that, sitting in the chair of Christ, he may piously rule His Church.  Who, then, shall be set apart?  For by the counsel of God that man is set forth as blessed, whom his Lord shall appoint over the ministry of his fellow-servants, to give them their meat in their season, not thinking and saying in his heart, My Lord delayeth His coming, and who shall not begin to beat his fellow-servants, eating and drinking with harlots and drunkards.  And the Lord of that servant shall come in an hour when he doth not look for Him, and in a day when he is not aware, and shall cut him in sunder, and shall assign his unfaithful part with the hypocrites. <a name="fr_1020"></a><a href="#fn_1020"><font size="1">1021</font></a>
