 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.v-p2"></a>“Wherefore I do not think that any one will be able to quench such a fire as has been kindled.  For no one doubts his promises; but every one affirms that this is so.  Wherefore, lest you should expose yourselves to danger, I advise you not to attempt anything against him until Peter come, who alone shall be able to resist such a power, being the most esteemed disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ.  For so much do I fear this man, that if he had not elsewhere been vanquished in disputing with my lord Peter, I should counsel you to persuade even Peter himself not to attempt to oppose Simon.”</p>
