  that He might show that these things were done on account of the ungrateful, He translated to immortality a certain one of the first race of men, because He saw that he was not unmindful of His grace, and because he hoped to call on the name of God; <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">732</font></a>
  while the rest, who were so ungrateful that they could not be amended and corrected even by labours and tribulations, were condemned to a terrible death.  Yet amongst them also He found a certain one, who was righteous with his house, <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">733</font></a>
  whom He preserved, having enjoined him to build an ark, in which he and those who were commanded to go with him might escape, when all things should be destroyed by a deluge:  in order that, the wicked being cut off by the overflow of waters, the world might receive a purification; and he who had been preserved for the continuance of the race, being purified by water, might anew repair the world.</p>
