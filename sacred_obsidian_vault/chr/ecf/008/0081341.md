 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.ix-p2"></a>Then the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of all, affectionate and most mild, saluting Adam kindly, said to him:  Peace be to thee, Adam, with thy children, through immeasurable ages of ages!  Amen.  Then father Adam, falling forward at the feet of the Lord, and being raised erect, kissed His hands, and shed many tears, saying, testifying to all:  Behold the hands which fashioned me!  And he said to the Lord:  Thou hast come, O King of glory, delivering men, and bringing them into Thy everlasting kingdom.  Then also our mother Eve in like manner fell forward at the feet of our Lord, and was raised erect, and kissed His hands, and poured forth tears in abundance, and <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 458</font></a> <a name="vii.xvii.ix-Page_458"></a>said, testifying to all:  Behold the hands which made me!</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.ix-p3"></a>Then all the saints, adoring Him, cried out, saying:  Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord!  The Lord God hath shone upon us—amen—through all ages.  Alleluia for ever and ever!  Praise, honour, power, glory! because Thou hast come from on high to visit us.  Singing Alleluia continually, and rejoicing together concerning His glory, they ran together under the hands of the Lord.  Then the Saviour, inquiring thoroughly about all, seized Hades, <a name="fr_2011"></a><a href="#fn_2011"><font size="1">2012</font></a>
  immediately threw some down into Tartarus, and led some with Him to the upper world.</p>
