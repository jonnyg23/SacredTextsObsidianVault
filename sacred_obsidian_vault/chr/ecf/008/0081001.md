 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xxx-p2"></a>“But the Master knowing that those who wrongfully do these things are guilty by means of their former sins, and that the spirit of wickedness works these things by means of the guilty, has counselled to compassionate men, as they are men, and as being the instruments of wickedness through sin; <i>and this counsel</i> He has given to His disciples as claiming philanthropy, and, as much as in us lies, to absolve the wrong-doers from condemnation, that, as it were, the temperate may help the drunken, by prayers, fastings, and benedictions, not resisting, not avenging, lest they should compel them to sin more.  For when a person is condemned by any one to suffer, it is not reasonable for him to be angry with him by whose means the suffering comes; for he ought to reason, that if he had not ill-used him, yet because he was to be ill-used, he must have suffered it by means of another.  Why, then, should I be angry with the dispenser, when I was condemned at all events to suffer?  But yet, further:  if we do these same things to the evil on pretence of <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xv.xxx-Page_299"></a>revenge, we who are good do the very things which the evil do, excepting that they do them first, and we second; and, as I said, we ought not to be angry, as knowing that in the providence of God, the evil punish the good.  Those, therefore, who are bitter against their punishers, sin, as disdaining the messengers of God; but those who honour them, and set themselves in opposition to those who think to injure them, <a name="fr_1151"></a><a href="#fn_1151"><font size="1">1152</font></a>
  are pious towards God who has thus decreed.”</p>
