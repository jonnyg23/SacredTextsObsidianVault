 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.lxi-p2"></a>To this Simon answered:  “Apply your mind to those things which I am going to say, and cause it, walking in peaceable paths, to attain to those things which I shall demonstrate.  Listen now, therefore.  Did you never in thought reach forth your mind into regions or islands situated far away, and remain so fixed in them, that you could not even see the people that were before you, or know where yourself were sitting, by reason of the delightfulness of those things on which you were gazing?”  And Peter said:  “It is true, Simon, this has often occurred to me.”  Then Simon said:  “In this way now reach forth your sense into heaven, yea above the heaven, and behold that there must be some place beyond the world, or outside the world, in which there is neither heaven nor earth, and where no shadow of these things produces darkness; and consequently, since there are neither bodies in it, nor darkness occasioned by bodies, there must of necessity be immense light; and consider of what sort that light must be, which is never succeeded by darkness.  For if the light of this sun fills this whole world, how great do you suppose that bodiless and infinite light to be?  So great, doubtless, that this light of the sun would seem to be darkness and not light, in comparison.”</p>
