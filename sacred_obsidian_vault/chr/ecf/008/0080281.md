 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.v-p2"></a>“For so also it was given to the people of the Hebrews from the beginning, that they should love Moses, and believe his word; whence also it is written:  The people believed God, and Moses His servant. <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">724</font></a>
   What, therefore, was of peculiar gift from God toward the nation of the Hebrews, we see now to be given also to those who are called from among the Gentiles to the faith.  But the method of works is put into the power and will of every one, and this is their own; but to have an affection towards a teacher of truth, this is a gift of the heavenly Father.  But salvation is in this, that you do His will of whom you have conceived a love and affection through the gift of God; lest that saying of His <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.vi.v-Page_136"></a>be addressed to you which He spoke, Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say? <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">725</font></a>
   It is therefore the peculiar gift bestowed by God upon the Hebrews, that they believe Moses; and the peculiar gift bestowed upon the Gentiles is that they love Jesus.  For this also the Master intimated, when He said, I will confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">726</font></a>
   By which it is certainly declared, that the people of the Hebrews, who were instructed out of the law, did not know Him; but the people of the Gentiles have acknowledged Jesus, and venerate Him; on which account also they shall be saved, not only acknowledging Him, but also doing His will.  But he who is of the Gentiles, and who has it of God to believe Moses, ought also to have it of his own purpose to love Jesus also.  And again, the Hebrew, who has it of God to believe Moses, ought to have it also of his own purpose to believe in Jesus; so that each of them, having in himself something of the divine gift, and something of his own exertion, may be perfect by both.  For concerning such an one our Lord spoke, as of a rich man, Who brings forth from his treasures things new and old. <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">727</font></a>
