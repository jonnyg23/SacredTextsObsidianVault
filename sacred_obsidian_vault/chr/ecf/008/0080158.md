 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxi-p2"></a>“For if we occupy the short time of this life with vain and useless questions, we shall without doubt go into the presence of God empty and void of good works, when, as I have said, our works shall be brought into judgment.  For everything has its own time and place.  This is the place, this the time of works; the world to come, that of recompenses.  That we may not therefore be entangled, by changing the order of places and times, let us inquire, in the first place, what is the righteousness of God; so that, like persons going to set out on a journey, we may be filled with good works as with abundant provision, so that we may be able to come to the kingdom of God, as to a very great city.  For to those who think aright, God is manifest even by the operations of the world which He hath made, using the evidence of His creation; <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">616</font></a>
  and therefore, since there ought to be no doubt about God, we have now to inquire only about His righteousness and His kingdom.  But if our mind suggest to us to make any inquiry concerning secret and hidden things before we inquire into the works of righteousness, we ought to render to ourselves a reason, because if acting well we shall merit to obtain salvation:   then, going to God chaste and clean, we shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, and shall know all things that are secret and hidden, without any cavilling of questions; whereas now, even if any one should spend the whole of his life in inquiring into these things, he not only shall not be able to find them, but shall involve himself in greater errors, because he did not first enter through the way of righteousness, and strive to reach the haven of life.”</p>
