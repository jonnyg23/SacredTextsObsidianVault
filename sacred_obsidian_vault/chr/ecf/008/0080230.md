 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xx-p2"></a>Then Peter answered:  “To those who do not read the law according to the tradition of Moses, my speech appears to be contrary to it; but I will show you how it is not contradictory.  God is seen by the mind, not by the body; by the spirit, not by the flesh.  Whence also angels, who are spirits, see God; and therefore men, as long as they are men, cannot see Him.  But after the resurrection of the dead, when they shall have been made like the angels, <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">688</font></a>
  they shall be able to see God.  And thus my statement is not contrary to the law; neither is that which our Master said, Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God. <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">689</font></a>
   For He showed that a time shall come in which of men shall be made angels, who in the spirit of their mind shall see God.”  After these and many similar sayings, Simon began to assert with many oaths, saying:  “Concerning one thing only render me a reason, whether the soul is immortal, and I shall submit to your will in all things.  But let it be to-morrow, for to-day it is late.”  When therefore Peter began to speak, Simon went out, and with him a very few of his associates; and that for shame.  But all the rest, turning to Peter, on bended knees prostrated themselves before him; and some of those who were afflicted with diverse sicknesses, or invaded by demons, were healed by the prayer of Peter, and departed rejoicing, as having obtained at once the doctrine of the true God, and also His mercy.  When therefore the crowds had withdrawn, and only we his attendants remained with him, we sat down on couches placed on the ground, each one recognising his accustomed place, and having taken food, and given thanks to God, we went to sleep.</p>
