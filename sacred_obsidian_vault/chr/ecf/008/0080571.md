 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lxiii-p2"></a>Then said I:  “God arranges our affairs to our liking; for we have with us Anubion an astrologer, with whom, if we come to Antioch, we shall dispute with all earnestness on the subject of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lxiii-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span>.”  And when our father had set out, after the middle of the night, with those whom Peter had ordered to accompany him, and with Anubion; in the morning, before Peter went to the discussion, those men returned who had convoyed Simon, namely Appion and Athenodorus, and came to us inquiring after my father.  But Peter, when he was informed of their coming, ordered them to enter.  And when they were seated, they asked, “Where is Faustinianus?”  Peter answered:  “We do not know; for since the evening that he went to you, no one of his friends has seen him.  But yesterday morning Simon came inquiring for him; and because we gave him no answer, I know not what he meant, but he said that he was Faustinianus.  But when nobody believed him, he went and lamented, and threatened that he would destroy himself; and afterwards he went away towards the sea.”</p>
