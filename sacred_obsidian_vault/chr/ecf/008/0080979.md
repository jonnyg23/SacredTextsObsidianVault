 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.viii-p2"></a>Then Peter inquired, “Are you really, then, alone in your family?”  Then I answered, “There are indeed many and great men, being of the kindred of Cæsar.  Wherefore Cæsar himself gave a wife of his own family to my father, who was his foster-brother; and of her three sons of us were born, two before me, who were twins and very like each other, as my father told me.  But I scarcely know either them or our mother, but bear about with me an obscure image of them, as through dreams.  My mothers name was Mattidia, and my fathers, Faustus; and of my brothers one was called Faustinus, and the other Faustinianus. <a name="fr_1145"></a><a href="#fn_1145"><font size="1">1146</font></a>
   Then after I, their third son, was born, my mother saw a vision—so my father told me—<i>which told her</i>, that unless she immediately took away her twin sons, and left the city of Rome for exile for twelve years, she and they must die by an all-destructive fate.</p>
