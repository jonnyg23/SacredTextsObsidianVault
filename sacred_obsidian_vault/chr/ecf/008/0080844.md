 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xxvi-p2"></a>While I was saying these things to Appion, Peter drew near from Cæsarea, and in Tyre the people were flocking together, hurrying to meet him and unite in an expression of gratification at his visit.  And Appion withdrew, accompanied by Anubion and Athenodorus only; but the rest of us hurried to meet Peter, and I was the first to greet him at the gate, and I led him towards the inn.  When we arrived, we dismissed the people; and when he deigned to ask what had taken place, I concealed nothing, but told him of Simons slanders, and the monstrous shapes he had taken, and all the diseases he had sent after the sacrificial feast, and that some of the sick persons were still there in Tyre, while others had gone on with Simon to Sidon just as I arrived, hoping to be cured by him, but that I had heard that none of them had been cured by him.  I also told Peter of the controversy I had with Appion; and he, from his love to me, and desiring to encourage me, praised and blessed me.  Then, having supped, he betook himself to the rest the fatigues of his journey rendered so necessary.</p>
