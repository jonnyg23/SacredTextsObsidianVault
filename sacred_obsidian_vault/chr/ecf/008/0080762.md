 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.i-p3"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vii.i-p3.1"></a>Thus</span> I Clement, departing from Cæsarea Stratonis, together with Nicetas and Aquila, entered into Tyre of Phœnicia; <a name="fr_1029"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">1030</font></a>
  and according to the injunction of Peter, who sent us, we lodged with Bernice, the daughter of Justa the Canaanitess.  She received us most joyfully; and striving with much honour towards me, and with affection towards Aquila and Nicetas, and speaking freely as a friend, through joy she treated us courteously, and hospitably urged us to take bodily refreshment.  Perceiving, therefore, that she was endeavouring to impose a short delay upon us, I said:  “You do well, indeed, to busy yourself in fulfilling the part of love; but the fear of our God must take the precedence of this.  For, having a combat on hand on behalf of many souls, we are afraid of preferring our own ease before their salvation.</p>
