 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xv-p2"></a>You say, therefore, if God wishes anything to be, it is; and if He do not wish it, it is not.  <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.v.xv-Page_121"></a>But if I were to answer that what He wishes is, and what He wishes not is not, you would say that then He wishes the evil things to be which are done in the world, since everything that He wishes is, and everything that He wishes not is not.  But if I had answered that it is not so that what God wishes is, and what He wishes not is not, then you would retort upon me that God must then be powerless, if He cannot do what He wills; and you would be all the more petulant, as thinking that you had got a victory, though had said nothing to the point.  Therefore you are ignorant, O Simon, yea very ignorant, how the will of God acts in each individual case.  For some things, as we have said, He has so willed to be, that they cannot be otherwise than as they are ordained by Him; and to these He has assigned neither rewards nor punishments; but those which He has willed to be so that they have it in their power to do what they will, He has assigned to them according to their actions and their wills, to earn either rewards or punishments.  Since, therefore, as I have informed you, all things that are moved are divided into two parts, according to the distinction that I formerly stated, everything that God wills is, and everything that He wills not is not.</p>
