 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.vi-p2"></a>“For on this account Jesus is concealed from the Jews, who have taken Moses as their teacher, and Moses is hidden from those who have believed Jesus.  For, there being one teaching by both, God accepts him who has believed either of these.  But believing a teacher is for the sake of doing the things spoken by God.  And that this is so our Lord Himself says, I thank thee, Father of heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these things from the wise and elder, and hast revealed them to sucking babes. <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">1093</font></a>
   Thus God Himself has concealed a teacher from some, as foreknowing what they ought to do, and has revealed him to others, who are ignorant what they ought to do.</p>
