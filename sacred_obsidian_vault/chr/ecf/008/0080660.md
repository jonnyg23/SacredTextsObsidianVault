 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxvii-p2"></a>When Aquila had thus spoken, his brother Nicetas said:  “It is necessary, O Clement our brother, for me to mention what has been left out by Aquila.  For, in the first place, God is witness that we assisted him in no impious work, but that we looked on while he wrought; and as long as he did harmless things, and exhibited them, we were also pleased.  But when, in order to deceive the godly, he said that he did, by means of godhead, the things that were done by magic, we no longer endured him, though he made us many promises, especially that our statues should be thought worthy of <i>a place in</i> the temple, <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">941</font></a>
  and that we should be thought to be gods, and should be worshipped by the multitude, and should be honoured by kings, and should be thought worthy of public honours, and enriched with boundless wealth.</p>
