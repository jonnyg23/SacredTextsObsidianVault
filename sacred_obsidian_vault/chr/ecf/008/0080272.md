 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lxii-p2"></a>“Meantime I shall remain with you three months, as I promised.  Be ye constant in hearing the word; and at the end of that time, if any are able and willing to follow us, they may do so, if duty will admit of it.  And when I say <i>if duty will admit</i> I mean that no one by his departure must sadden any one who ought not to be saddened, as by leaving parents who ought not to be left, or a faithful wife, or any other person to whom he is bound to afford comfort for Gods sake.”  Meantime, disputing and teaching day by day, he filled up the time appointed with the labour of teaching; and when the festival day arrived, upwards of ten thousand were baptized.</p>
