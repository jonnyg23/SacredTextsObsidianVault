 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-p2"></a>“I am the first power, who am always, and without beginning. <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">699</font></a>
   But having entered the womb of Rachel, I was born of her as a man, that I might be visible to men.  I have flown through the air; I have been mixed with fire, and been made one body with it; I have made statues to move; I have animated lifeless things; I have made stones bread; I have flown from mountain to mountain; I have moved from place to place, upheld by angels hands, and have lighted on the earth.  Not only have I done these things; but even now I am able to do them, that by facts I may prove to all, that I am the Son of God, enduring to eternity, and that I can make those who believe on me endure in like manner for ever.  But your words are all vain; nor can you perform any real works <i>such as I have now mentioned</i>, <a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-Page_127"></a>as he also who sent you is a magician, who yet could not deliver himself from the suffering of the cross.”</p>
