 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2"></a>Then I Clement, understanding that he perchance was my father, was drowned in tears, and my brothers also were ready to rush forward and to disclose the matter; but Peter restrained them, saying:  “Be quiet, until I give you permission.”  Therefore Peter, answering, said to the old man:  “What was the name of your younger son?”  And he said:  “Clement.”  Then Peter:  “If I shall this day restore to you your most chaste wife and your three sons, will you believe that a modest mind can overcome unreasonable impulses, and that all things that have been spoken by us are true, and that <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span> is nothing?”  Then said the old man:  “As <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-Page_191"></a>it is impossible for you to perform what you have promised, so it is impossible that anything can take place apart from <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.2"></a>Genesis</span>.”  Then says Peter:  “I wish to have all who are here present as witnesses that I shall this day hand over to you your wife, who is living most chastely, with your three sons.  And now take a token of these things from this, that I know the whole story much more accurately than you do; and I shall relate the whole occurrences in order, both that you may know them, and that those who are present may learn.”</p>
