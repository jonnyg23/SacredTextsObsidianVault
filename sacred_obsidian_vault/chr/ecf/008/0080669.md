 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-p2"></a>But he (Peter) saw me disheartened, and asked the reason; and being told that it proceeded from no cause but the postponement of <a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.v.xxxvi-Page_236"></a>the inquiry, <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">944</font></a>
