 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xiii-p2"></a>But Peter most kindly, when he heard my name, immediately ran to me and kissed me.  Then, having made me sit down, he said, “Thou didst well to receive as thy guest Barnabas, preacher of the truth, nothing fearing the rage of the insane people.  Thou shalt be blessed.  For as you have deemed an ambassador of the truth worthy of all honour, so the truth herself shall receive thee a wanderer and a stranger, and shall enroll thee a citizen of her own city; and then there shall be great joy to thee, because, imparting a small favour, thou shalt be written heir of eternal blessings.  Now, therefore, do not trouble yourself to explain your mind to me; for Barnabas has with faithful speech informed me of all things about you and your dispositions, almost daily and without ceasing, recalling the memory of your good qualities.  And to point out to you shortly, as to a friend already of one mind with us, what is your best course; if there is nothing to hinder you, come along with us, and hear the word of the truth, which we are going to speak in every place until we come even to the city of Rome; and now, if you wish anything, speak.”</p>
