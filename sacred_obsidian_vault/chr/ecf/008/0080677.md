  whose then are all things?  If He is false, who then is true?  If He dwells in a tabernacle, who is without bounds?  If He is fond of fat, and sacrifices, and offerings, and drink-offerings, who then is without need, and who is holy, and pure, and perfect?  If He is pleased with candles and candlesticks, who then placed the luminaries in heaven?  If He dwells in shadow, and darkness, and storm, and smoke, who is the light that lightens the universe?  If He comes with trumpets, and shoutings, and darts, and arrows, who is the looked-for tranquillity of all?  If He loves war, who then wishes peace?  If He makes evil things, who makes good things?  If He is without affection, who is a lover of men?  If He is not faithful to His promises, who shall be trusted?  If He loves the wicked, and adulterers, and murderers, who shall be a just judge?  If He changes His mind, who is stedfast?  If He chooses evil men, who then takes the part of the good?</p>
