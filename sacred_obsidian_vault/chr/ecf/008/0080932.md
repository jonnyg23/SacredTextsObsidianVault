 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xxv-p2"></a>“But if they were able to do something, you should not be right in calling them gods:  for it is not right to call the elements gods, by which good things are supplied; but only Him who ordereth them, to accomplish all things for our use, and who commandeth them to be serviceable to man,—Him alone we call God in propriety of speech, whose beneficence you do not perceive, but permit those elements to rule over you which have been assigned to you as your servants.  And why should I speak of the elements, when you not only have made and do worship lifeless images, but deign to be subject to them in all respects as servants?  Wherefore, by reason of your erroneous judgments, you have become subject to demons.  However, by acknowledgment of God Himself, by good deeds you can again become masters, and command the demons as slaves, and as sons of God be constituted heirs of the eternal kingdom.”</p>
