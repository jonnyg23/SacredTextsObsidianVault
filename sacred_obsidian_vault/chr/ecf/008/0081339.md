 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.vii-p2"></a>And again there came the voice of the Son of the Father most high, as it were the voice of a great thunder, saying:  Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory will come in.  Then Satan and Hades cried out, saying:  Who is the king of glory?  And it was answered to them in the voice of the Lord:  The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.vii-p3"></a>After this voice there came a man, whose appearance was that of a robber, carrying a cross on his shoulder, crying from the outside of the door, and saying:  Open to me, that I may come in.  And Satan, opening to him a little, brought him inside into his dwelling, <a name="fr_2009"></a><a href="#fn_2009"><font size="1">2010</font></a>
  and again shut the door after him.  And all the saints saw him most clearly, and said to him forthwith:  Thy appearance is that of a robber.  Tell us what it is that thou carriest on thy back.  And he answered, and said with humility:  Truly I was a robber altogether; and the Jews hung me up on a cross, along with my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father most high.  I, in fine, have come heralding <a name="fr_2010"></a><a href="#fn_2010"><font size="1">2011</font></a>
  Him; He indeed is coming immediately behind me.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.vii-p6"></a>Then holy David, inflamed with anger against Satan, cried out aloud:  Open thy gates, most vile wretch, that the King of glory may come in.  In like manner also all the saints of God rose up against Satan, and would have seized him, and divided him among them.  And again a cry was heard within:  Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall come in.  Hades and Satan, at that clear voice, again asked, saying:  Who is this king of glory?  And it was said to them by that wonderful voice:  The Lord of powers, He is the King of glory.</p>
