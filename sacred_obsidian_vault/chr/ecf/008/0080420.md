 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2"></a>“And, indeed, I know that several of the philosophers were rather of this opinion, that God the Creator made divisions and distinctions from one body, which they call <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2.1"></a>Matter</span>, which yet consisted of four elements, mingled into one by a certain tempering of divine providence.  For I think that what some have said is vain, that the body of the world is simple, that is, without any conjunction; since it is evident that what is simple can neither be a body, nor can be mixed, or propagated, or dissolved; all which, we see, happen to the bodies of the world.  For how could it be dissolved if it were simple, and had not within it that from which it might be resolved and divided?  But if bodies seem to be composed of two, or three, or even of four elements,—who that has even a small portion of sense does not perceive that there must have been some one who collected several into one, and preserving the measure of tempering, made a solid body out of diverse parts?  This <i>some one,</i> therefore, we call God, the Creator of the world, and acknowledge Him as the author of the universe.</p>
