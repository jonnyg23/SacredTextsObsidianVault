 <p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.xi-p3"></a>Restoration of the town of Medzpine; name of Sanadroug; his death.</p> 
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.xi-p4"></a>Of all Sanadrougs doings and actions, we judge none worthy of remembrance except the building of the town of Medzpine; for, this town having been shaken by an earthquake, Sanadroug pulled it down, rebuilt it more magnificently, and surrounded it with double walls and ramparts.  Sanadroug caused to be erected in the middle of the town his statue holding in his hand a single piece of money, which signifies:  “All my treasures have been used in building the town, and no more than this single piece of money is left to me.”</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.xi-p5"></a>But why was this prince called Sanadroug?  We will tell you:  Because Abgars sister, Otæa, while travelling in Armenia in the winter, was assailed by a whirlwind of snow in the Gortouk mountains; the tempest separated them all, so that none of them knew where his companion had been driven.  The princes nurse, Sanod, sister of Piourad Pacradouni, wife of Khosran Ardzrouni, having taken the royal infant, for Sanadroug was still in the cradle, laid him upon her bosom, and remained with him under the snow three days and three nights.  Legend has taken possession of this circumstance:  it relates that an animal, a new species, wonderful, of great whiteness, sent by the gods, guarded the child.  But so far as we have been informed, this is the fact:  a white dog, which was amongst the men sent in search, found the child and his nurse; the prince was therefore called Sanadroug, a name taken from his nurses name (and from the Armenian name, <i>dourk</i>, a gift), as if to signify the gift of Sanod.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.xi-p6"></a>Sanadroug, having ascended the throne in the twelfth year of Ardachès, king of the Persians, and having lived thirty years, died as he was hunting, from an arrow which pierced his bowels, as if in punishment of the torments which he had made his holy daughter suffer.  Gheroupna, son of the scribe Apchatar, collected all these facts, happening in the time of Abgar and Sanadroug, and placed them in the archives of Edessa.</p>
