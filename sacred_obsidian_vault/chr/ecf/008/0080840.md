 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xxii-p2"></a>“Thus, to right-thinking men, it is clear that they were admitted to be mortals.  And their contemporaries, knowing that they were mortal, <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix.xxii-Page_267"></a>when they died paid them no more heed; and it was length of time which clothed them with the glory of gods.  Nor need you wonder that they who lived in the times of Æsculapius and Hercules were deceived, or the contemporaries of Dionysus or any other of the men of that time, when even Hector in Ilium, and Achilles in the island of Leuce, are worshipped by the inhabitants of those places; and the Opuntines worship Patroclus, and the Rhodians Alexander of Macedon. <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">1078</font></a>
