 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.ii-p2"></a>“If, therefore, while I expound and show you that this is the greatest sin, which is able to destroy you all, it occur to your mind that you are not destroyed, being great multitudes, you are deceived.  For you have the example of the old world deluged.  And yet their sin was much less than that which is chargeable against you.  For they were wicked with respect to their equals, murdering or committing adultery.  But you are wicked against the God of all, worshipping lifeless images instead of Him or along with Him, and attributing His divine name to every kind of senseless matter.  In the first place, therefore, you are unfortunate in not knowing the difference between monarchy and polyarchy—that monarchy, on the one hand, is productive of concord, but polyarchy is effective of wars.  For unity does not fight with itself, but multitude has occasion of undertaking battle one against another.</p>
