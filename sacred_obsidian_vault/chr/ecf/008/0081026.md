 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xxi-p2"></a>“Much better is it, then, that your first circumstances should be distressing.  For when this is the case, they do not so deeply grieve you, because you hope that they will pass away, and they yield joy though the expectation of better circumstances.  But, above all, I wish you to know how much chastity is pleasing to God.  The chaste woman is Gods choice, Gods good pleasure, Gods glory, Gods child.  So great a blessing is chastity, <a name="fr_1187"></a><a href="#fn_1187"><font size="1">1188</font></a>
