 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.xii-p2"></a>As he said these things, all fell on their knees before his feet.  And he, lifting up his hands to heaven, prayed to God, and healed them all by his simple prayer alone.  And he remained not many days in Beyrout; but after he had accustomed many to the service of the one God, and had baptized them, and had set over them a bishop from the elders who were with him, he went to Byblus.  And when he came there, and learned that Simon had not waited for them for a day, but had gone straightway to Tripolis, he remained there only a few days; and after that he had healed not a few, and exercised them in the Scriptures, he followed in Simons track to Tripolis, preferring to pursue him rather than flee from him.</p>
