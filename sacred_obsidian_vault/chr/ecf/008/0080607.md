 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></a>“But some things also you ought of yourselves to consider, on account of his not being able to speak openly by reason of the plots.  Such as:  if he be hostile to any one, do not wait for his speaking; and do not take part with that man, but prudently follow the bishops will, being enemies to those to whom he is an enemy, and not conversing with those with whom he does not converse, in order that every one, desiring to have you all as his friends, may be reconciled to him and be saved, listening to his discourse.  But if any one remain a friend of those to whom he is an enemy, and speak to those with whom he does not converse, he also himself is one of those who would waste the church.  For, being with you in body, but not with you in judgment, he is against you; and is much worse than the open enemies from without, since with seeming friendship he disperses those who are within.”</p>
