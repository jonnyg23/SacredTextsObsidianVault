 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.xvii-p2"></a>“For reckon to me how many mistresses they have rewarded, some of whom they have placed among the stars; and of some they have blessed both the children and the associates.  Thus Zeus made Callisto a constellation, called the Little Bear, which some also call the Dogs Tail.  Poseidon also placed the dolphin in the sky for the sake of Amphitrite; and he gave a place among the stars to Orion the son of Euryale, the daughter of Minos, for the sake of his mother Euryale.  And Dionysus made a constellation of the crown of Ariadne, and Zeus invested the eagle which assisted him in the rape of Ganymede, and Ganymede himself with the honour of the Water-pourer.  Also he honoured the bull for the sake of Europa; and also having bestowed Castor, and Polydeuces, and Helena upon Leda, he made them stars.  Also Perseus for the sake of Danae; and Arcus for the sake of Callisto.  The virgin who also is Dice, for the sake of Themis; and Heracles for the sake of Alcmene.  But I do not enlarge further; for it were long to tell particularly how many others the gods have blessed for the sake of their many mistresses. in their intercourse with human beings, which senseless men repudiate as evil <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.viii.xvii-Page_260"></a>deeds, not knowing that pleasure is the great advantage among men.</p>
