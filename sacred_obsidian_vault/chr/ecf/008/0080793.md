 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.vi-p2"></a>“Then said I:  Are those things correct, then, which are spoken by poets and philosophers, that in Hades the souls of the wicked are judged and punished for their attempts; such as those of Ixion, and Tantalus, and Tityus, and Sisyphus, and the daughters of Danaus, and as many others as have been impious here?  And how, if these things are not so, is it possible that magic can subsist?  Then he having told me that these things are so in Hades, I asked him:  Why are not we ourselves afraid of magic, being persuaded of the punishment in Hades for adultery?  For I do not admit that it is a righteous thing to compel to adultery a woman who is unwilling; but if any one will engage to persuade her, I am ready for that, besides confessing my thanks.</p>
