 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxxii-p2"></a>Aquila having thus spoken, I Clement inquired:  “What, then, are the prodigies that he works?”  And they told me that he makes statues walk, and that he rolls himself on the fire, and is not burnt; and sometimes he flies; and he makes loaves of stones; he becomes a serpent; he transforms himself into a goat; he becomes two-faced; he changes himself into gold; he opens lockfast gates; he melts iron; at banquets he produces images of all manner of forms.  In his house he makes dishes be seen as borne of themselves to wait upon him, no bearers being seen.  I wondered when I heard them speak thus; but many bore witness that they had been present, and had seen such things.</p>
