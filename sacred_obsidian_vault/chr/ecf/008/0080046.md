 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.vii-p2"></a>Let us consider, therefore, my brethren, and see how all the righteous fathers conducted themselves during the whole time of their sojourn in <i>this</i> life, and let us search and examine from the law <i>down</i> to the New Testament.  For this is both becoming and profitable, that we should know how many men there have been, and who <i>they were</i>, that have perished through women; and who and how many have been the women that have perished through men, by reason of the constancy with which they have associated with one another.  And further, also, for the same reason, I will show how many have been the men, and who <i>they were</i>, that lived all their lifetime, and continued even to the close, with one another in <i>the performance of</i> chaste works without blemish.  And it is manifest and well-known that this is so. <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">470</font></a>
