 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-p2"></a>And Simon:  “Why is it, then, that some die prematurely, and periodical diseases arise; and that there are, moreover, attacks of demons, and of madness, and all other kinds of afflictions which can greatly punish?”  And Peter said:  “Because men, following their own pleasure in all things, cohabit without observing the proper times; and thus the deposition of seed, taking place unseasonably, naturally produces a multitude of evils.  For they ought to reflect, that as a season has been fixed suitable for planting and sowing, <a name="fr_1464"></a><a href="#fn_1464"><font size="1">1465</font></a>
  so days have been appointed as appropriate for cohabitation, which are carefully to be observed.  Accordingly some one well instructed in the doctrines taught by Moses, finding fault with the people for their sins, called them sons of the new moons and the sabbaths. <a name="fr_1465"></a><a href="#fn_1465"><font size="1">1466</font></a>
   Yet in the beginning of the world men lived long, and had no diseases.  But when through carelessness they neglected the observation of the proper times, then the sons in succession cohabiting through ignorance at times when <a name="fr_1466"></a><a href="#fn_1466"><font size="1">1467</font></a>
  they ought not, place their children under innumerable afflictions.  Whence our Teacher, when we inquired of Him <a name="fr_1467"></a><a href="#fn_1467"><font size="1">1468</font></a>
  in regard to the man who was blind from his birth, and recovered his sight, if this man sinned, or his parents, that he should be born blind, answered, Neither did he sin at all, nor his parents, but that the power of God might be made manifest through him in healing the sins of ignorance. <a name="fr_1468"></a><a href="#fn_1468"><font size="1">1469</font></a>
   And, in truth, such afflictions arise because of ignorance; as, for instance, by not knowing when one ought to cohabit with his wife, as if she be pure from her discharge.  Now the afflictions which you mentioned before are the result of ignorance, and not, assuredly, of any wickedness that has been perpetrated.  Moreover, give me the man who sins not, and I will show you the man who suffers not; and you will find that he not only does not suffer himself, but that he is able <a name="fr_1469"></a><a href="#fn_1469"><font size="1">1470</font></a>
  to heal others.  For instance, Moses, on account of his <a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxii-Page_338"></a>piety, continued free from suffering all his life, and by his prayers he healed the Egyptians when they suffered on account of their sins.”</p>
