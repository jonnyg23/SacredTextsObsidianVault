 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.v-p2"></a>Then I answered:  “Think not, my lord, that I suffer these things unreasonably; but there is a certain cause and reason of this affection of mine towards you.  For I have you alone as the object of all my affections, instead of father and mother, and brethren; but above all this, is the fact that you alone are the cause of my salvation and knowledge of the truth.  And also this I do not count of least moment, that my youthful age is subject to the snares of lusts; and I am afraid to be without you, by whose sole presence all effeminacy, however irrational it be, is put to shame; although I trust, by the mercy of God, <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.ix.v-Page_158"></a>that even my mind, from what it has conceived through your instruction, shall be unable to receive aught else into its thoughts.  Besides, I remember your saying at Cæsarea, If any one wishes to accompany me, without violating dutifulness, let him accompany me.  And by this you meant that he should not make any one sad, to whom he ought according to Gods appointment to cleave; for example, that he should not leave a faithful wife, or parents, or the like.  Now from these I am entirely free, and so I am fit for following you; and I wish you would grant me that I might perform to you the service of a servant.”</p>
