 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxiv-p2"></a>“However, she, not only presuming to say and to hear that there are many gods, but also believing herself to be one, and in hope of being <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.vi.xxiv-Page_243"></a>that which she had not a nature to be, and throwing away what she had, and as a female being in her courses at the offering of sacrifices, is stained with blood; and then she pollutes those who touch her.  But when she conceives and brings forth temporary kings, she stirs up wars, shedding much blood; and those who desire to learn truth from her, by telling them all things contrary, and presenting many and various services, she keeps them always seeking and finding nothing, even until death.  For from the beginning a cause of death lies upon blind men; for she, prophesying deceit, and ambiguities, and obliquities, deceives those who believe her.</p>
