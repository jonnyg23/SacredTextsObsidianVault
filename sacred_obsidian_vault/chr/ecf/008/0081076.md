 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.ii-p2"></a>Now he said:  “He accuses you, Peter, of being the servant of wickedness, of having great power in magic, and as charming the souls of men in a way worse than idolatry. <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">1315</font></a>
   To prove that you are a magician, he seemed to me to adduce the following evidence, saying:  I am conscious of this, that when I come to hold a discussion with him, I do not remember a single word of what I have been meditating on by myself.  For while he is discoursing, and my mind is engaged in recollecting what it is that I thought of saying on coming to a conference with him, I do not hear anything whatsoever of what he is saying.  Now, since I do not experience this in the presence of any other than in his alone, is it not plain that I am under the influence of his magic?  And as to his doctrines being worse than those of idolatry, I can make that quite clear to any one who has understanding.  For there is no other benefit than this, that the soul should be freed from images <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1315"><font size="1">1316</font></a>
  of every kind.  For when the soul brings an image before its eye, it is bound by fear, and it pines away through anxiety lest it should suffer some calamity; and being altered, it falls under the influence of a demon; and being under his influence, it seems to the mass to be wise.</p>
