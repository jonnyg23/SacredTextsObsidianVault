 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xxxiv-p2"></a>Now Jesus was six years old, and His mother sent Him with a pitcher to the fountain to draw water with the children.  And it came to pass, after He had drawn the water, that one of the children came against Him, and struck the pitcher, and broke it.  But Jesus stretched out the cloak which He had on, and took up in His cloak as much water as there had been in the pitcher, and carried it to His mother.  And when she saw it she wondered, and reflected within herself, and laid up all these things in her heart. <a name="fr_1677"></a><a href="#fn_1677"><font size="1">1678</font></a>
