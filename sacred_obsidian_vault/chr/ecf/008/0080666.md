 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxxiii-p2"></a>These things having been thus spoken, the excellent Peter himself also proceeded to speak: <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">943</font></a>
   “You must perceive, brethren, the truth of the rule of conjunction, from which he who departs not cannot be misled.  For since, as we have said, we see all things in pairs and contraries, and as the night is first, and then the day; and first ignorance, then knowledge; first disease, then healing, so the things of error come first into our life, then truth supervenes, as the physician upon the disease.  Therefore straightway, when our God-loved nation was about to be ransomed from the oppression of the Egyptians, first diseases were produced by means of the rod turned into a serpent, which was given to Aaron, and then remedies were superinduced by the prayers of Moses.  And now also, when the Gentiles are about to be ransomed from the superstition with respect to idols, wickedness, which reigns over them, has by anticipation sent forth her ally like another serpent, even this Simon whom you see, who works wonders to astonish and deceive, not signs of healing to convert and save.  Wherefore it behoves you also from the miracles that are done to judge the doers, what is the character of the performer, and what that of the deed.  If he do unprofitable miracles, he is the agent of wickedness; but if he do profitable things, he is a leader of goodness.</p>
