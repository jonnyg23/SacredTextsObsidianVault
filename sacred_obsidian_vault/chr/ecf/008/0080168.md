 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxxi-p2"></a>“Thus, therefore, we, observing the commands of our Master, first offer peace to our hearers, that the way of salvation may be known without any tumult.  But if any one do not receive the words of peace, nor acquiesce in the truth, we know how to direct against him the war of the word, and to rebuke him sharply by confuting his ignorance and charging home upon him his sins.  Therefore of necessity we offer peace, that if any one is a son of peace, our peace may come upon him; but from him who makes himself an enemy of peace, our peace shall return to ourselves.  We do not therefore, as you say, propose peace by agreement with the wicked, for indeed we should straightway have given you the right hand; but only in order that, through our discussing quietly and patiently, it might be more easily ascertained by the hearers which is the true speech.  But if you differ and disagree with yourself, how shall you stand?  He must of necessity fall who is divided in himself; for every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand. <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">626</font></a>
   If you have aught to say to this, say on.”</p>
