 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.v-p2"></a>After Peter had spent a few days in teaching them in this way, and in healing them, they were baptized.  And after that, <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1082</font></a>
  all sat down together in the market-places in sackcloth and ashes, grieving because of his other wondrous works, and repenting their former sins.  And <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.x.v-Page_269"></a>when they of Sidon heard it, they did likewise, and sent to beseech Peter, since they could not come themselves for their diseases.  And Peter did not spend many days in Tyre; but when he had instructed all its inhabitants, and freed them from all manners of diseases and had founded a church, and set over it as bishop one of the elders who were with him, he departed for Sidon.  But when Simon heard that Peter was coming, he straightway fled to Beyrout with Appion and his friends.</p>
