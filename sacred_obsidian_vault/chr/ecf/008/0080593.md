 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.iv-p2"></a>“But I myself also, O Clement, know the griefs and anxieties, and dangers and reproaches, that are appointed you from the uninstructed multitudes; and these you will be able to bear nobly, looking to the great reward of patience bestowed on you by God.  But also consider this fairly with me:  When has Christ need of your aid?  Now, when the wicked one has sworn war against His bride; or in the time to come, when He shall reign victorious, having no need of further help?  Is it not evident to any one who has even the least understanding, that it is now?  Therefore with all good-will hasten in the time of the present necessity to do battle on the side of this good King, whose character it is to give great rewards after victory.  Therefore take the oversight gladly; and all the more in good time, because you have learned from me the administration of the Church, for the safety of the brethren who have taken refuge with us.</p>
