 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xvii-p2"></a>“But I shall begin the statement now.  God having made all things, if any one will not allow to a man, fashioned by His hands, to have possessed His great and Holy Spirit of foreknowledge, how does not he greatly err who attributes it to another born of a spurious stock! <a name="fr_958"></a><a href="#fn_958"><font size="1">959</font></a>
   And I do not think that he will obtain pardon, though he be misled by spurious scripture to think dreadful things against the Father of all.  For he who insults the image and the things belonging to the eternal King, has the sin reckoned as committed against Him in whose likeness the image was made.  But then, says he, the Divine Spirit left him when he sinned.  In that case <i>the Spirit</i> sinned along with him; and how can he escape peril who says this?  But perhaps he received the Spirit after he sinned.  Then it is given to the unrighteous; and where is justice?  But it was afforded to the just and the unjust.  This were most unrighteous of all.  Thus every falsehood, though it be aided by ten thousand reasonings, must receive its refutation, though after a long time.</p>
