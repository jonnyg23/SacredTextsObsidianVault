 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.xv-p2"></a>And Phinees a priest, and Adas a teacher, and Haggai a Levite, came down from Galilee to Jerusalem, and said to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites:  We saw Jesus and his disciples sitting on the mountain called Mamilch; <a name="fr_1843"></a><a href="#fn_1843"><font size="1">1844</font></a>
  and he said to his disciples, Go into all the world, and preach to every creature:  he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be condemned.  And these signs shall attend those who have believed:  in my name they shall cast out demons, speak new tongues, take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well.  And while Jesus was speaking to his disciples, we saw him taken up to heaven. <a name="fr_1844"></a><a href="#fn_1844"><font size="1">1845</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xv-p5"></a>The elders and the priests and Levites say:  Give glory to the God of Israel, and confess to Him whether you have heard and seen those things of which you have given us an account.  And those who had given the account said:  As the Lord liveth, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we heard these things, and saw him taken up into heaven.  The elders and the priests and the Levites say to them:  Have you come to give us this announcement, or to offer prayer to God?  And they say:  To offer prayer to God.  The elders and the chief priests and the Levites say to them:  If you have come to offer prayer to God, why then have you told these idle tales in the presence of all the people? <a name="fr_1845"></a><a href="#fn_1845"><font size="1">1846</font></a>
   Says Phinees the priest, and Adas the teacher, and Haggai the Levite to the rulers of the synagogues, and the priests and the Levites:  If what we have said and seen be sinful, behold, we are before you; do to us as seems good in your eyes.  And they took the law, and made them swear upon it, not to give any more an account of these matters to any one.  And they gave them to eat and drink, and sent them out of the city, having given them also money, and three men with them; and they sent them away to Galilee.  And these men having gone into Galilee, the chief priests, and the rulers of the synagogue, and the elders, came together into the synagogue, and locked the door, and lamented with a great lamentation, saying:  Is this a miracle that has happened in Israel?  And Annas and Caiaphas said:  Why are you so much moved?  Why do you weep?  Do you not know that his disciples have given a sum of gold to the guards of the tomb, and have instructed them to say that an angel came down and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb?  And the priests and the elders said:  Be it that his disciples have stolen his body; how is it that the life has come into his body, and that he is going about in Galilee?  And they being unable to give an answer to these things, said, after great hesitation:  It is not lawful for us to believe the uncircumcised.</p>
