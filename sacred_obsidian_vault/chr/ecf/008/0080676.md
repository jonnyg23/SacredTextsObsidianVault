 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xliii-p2"></a>“Wherefore, far be it from us to believe that the Lord of all, who made the heaven and the earth, and all things that are in them, shares His government with others, or that He lies.  For if He lies, then who speaks truth?  Or that He makes experiments as in ignorance; for then who foreknows?  And if He deliberates, and changes His purpose, who is perfect in understanding and permanent in design?  If He envies, who is above rivalry?  If He hardens hearts, who makes wise?  If He makes blind and deaf, who has given sight and hearing?  If He commits pilfering, who administers justice?  If He mocks, who is sincere?  If He is weak, who is omnipotent?  If He is unjust, who is just?  If He makes evil things, who shall make good things?  If He does evil, who shall do good?</p>
