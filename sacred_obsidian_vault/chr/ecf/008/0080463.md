 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2"></a>Then the old man:  “Do not take amiss, my son, what I am going to say.  Though your words are powerful, yet they cannot lead me to believe that anything can be done apart from <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span>.  For I know that all things have happened to me by the necessity of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.2"></a>Genesis</span>, <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">828</font></a>
