 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.x-p2"></a>Joseph therefore came from Judæa into Galilee, intending to marry the virgin who had been betrothed to him; for already three months had elapsed, and it was the beginning of the fourth since she had been betrothed to him.  In the meantime, it was evident from her shape that she was pregnant, nor could she conceal this from Joseph.  For in consequence of his being betrothed to her, coming to her more freely and speaking to her more familiarly, he found out that she was with child.  He began then to be in great doubt and perplexity, because he did not know what was best for him to do.  For, being a just man, he was not willing to expose her; nor, being a pious man, to injure her fair fame by a suspicion of fornication.  He came to the conclusion, therefore, privately to dissolve their contract, and to send her away secretly.  And while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying:  Joseph, thou son of David, fear not; that is, do not have any suspicion of fornication in the virgin, or think any evil of her; and fear not to take her as thy wife:  for that which is begotten in her, and which now vexes thy soul, is the work not of man, but of the Holy Spirit.  For she alone of all virgins shall bring forth the Son of God, and thou shalt call His name Jesus, that is, Saviour; for He shall save His people from their sins.  Therefore Joseph, according to the command of the angel, took the virgin as his wife; nevertheless he knew her not, but took care of her, and kept her in chastity. <a name="fr_1704"></a><a href="#fn_1704"><font size="1">1705</font></a>
   And now the ninth month from her conception was at hand, when Joseph, taking with him his wife along with what things he needed, went to Bethlehem, the city from which he came.  And it came to pass, while they were there, that her days were fulfilled that she should bring forth; and she brought forth her first-born son, as the holy evangelists have shown, our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Son <a name="fr_1705"></a><a href="#fn_1705"><font size="1">1706</font></a>
  and the Holy Ghost lives and reigns God from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
