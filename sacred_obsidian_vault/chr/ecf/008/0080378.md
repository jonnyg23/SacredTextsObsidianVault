 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xi-p2"></a>Peter, hearing this, shed tears of sympathy, and said to his friends who were present:  “If any man who is a worshipper of God had endured what this mans father has endured, immediately men would assign his religion as the cause of his calamities; but when these things happen to miserable Gentiles, they charge their misfortunes upon fate.  I call them miserable, because they are both vexed with errors here, and are deprived of future hope; whereas, when the worshippers of God suffer these things, their patient endurance of them contributes to their cleansing from sin.”</p>
