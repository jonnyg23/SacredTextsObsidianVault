 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xl-p2"></a>“If, therefore, it can be shown that mind and reason created all things, it follows that those things which come after are also managed by reason and providence.  But if unintelligent and blind nature produces all things, the reason of judgment is undoubtedly overthrown; and there is no ground to expect either punishment of sin or reward of well-doing where there is no judge.  Since, then, the whole matter depends upon this, and hangs by this head, do not take it amiss, if I wish this to be discussed and handled somewhat more fully.  For in this the first gate, as it were, is shut towards all things which are propounded, and therefore I wish first of all to have it opened to me.  Now therefore hear what my doctrine is; and if any one of you pleases, let him reply to me:  for I shall not be ashamed to learn, if I hear that which is true, and to assent to him who speaks rightly.  The discourse, then, which you delivered yesterday, which asserted that all things consist by art, and measure, and reason, does not fully persuade me that it is mind and reason that has made the world; for I have many things which I can show to consist by competent measure, and form, and species, and which yet were not made by mind and reason.  Then, besides, I see that many things are done in the world without arrangement, consequence, or justice, and that nothing can be done without the course of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.xl-p2.1"></a>Genesis</span>.  This I shall in the sequel prove most clearly from my own case.”</p>
