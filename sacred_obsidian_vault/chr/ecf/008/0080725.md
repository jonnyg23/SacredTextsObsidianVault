 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxviii-p2"></a>When Peter had thus spoken, Simon, at the outside of the crowd, cried aloud: <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">978</font></a>
   “Why would you lie, and deceive the unlearned multitude standing around you, persuading them that it is unlawful to think that there are gods, and to call them so, when the books that are current among the Jews say that there are many gods? <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">979</font></a>
   And now I wish, in the presence of all, to discuss with you from these books on the necessity of thinking that there are gods; first showing respecting him whom you call God, that he is not the supreme and omnipotent <i>Being</i>, inasmuch as he is without foreknowledge, imperfect, needy, not good, and underlying many and innumerable grievous passions.  Wherefore, when this has been shown from the Scriptures, as I say, it follows that there is another, not written of, foreknowing, perfect, without want, good, removed from all grievous passions.  But he whom you call the Creator is subject to the opposite <i>evils</i>.</p>
