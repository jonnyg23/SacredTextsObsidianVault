 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.viii-p2"></a>When the old man had said this, I Clement said to him:  “Hear, my father:  if my brother Niceta bring you to acknowledge that the world is not governed without the providence of God, I shall be able to answer you in that part which remains concerning the <i>genesis</i>; for I am well acquainted with this doctrine.”  And when I had thus spoken, my brother Aquila said:  “What is the use of our calling him <i>father</i>, when we are commanded to call no man father upon earth?” <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">812</font></a>
   Then, looking to the old man, he said, “Do not take it amiss, my father, that I have found fault with my brother for calling you <i>father</i>, for we have a precept not to call any one by that name.”  When Aquila said that, all the assembly of the bystanders, as well as the old man and Peter, <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.x.viii-Page_168"></a>laughed.  And when Aquila asked the reason of their all laughing, I said to him:  “Because you yourself do the very thing which you find fault with in another; for you called the old man <i>father</i>.”  But he denied it, saying:  “I am not aware that I called him <i>father</i>.”  Meantime Peter was moved with certain suspicions, <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">813</font></a>
  as he told us afterwards; and looking to Niceta, he said, “Go on with what you have proposed.”</p>
