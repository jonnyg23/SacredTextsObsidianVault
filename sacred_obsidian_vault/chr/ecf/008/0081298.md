 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiv.x-p2"></a>While they were thus speaking, there came another lowly man, carry<a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a> <a name="vii.xiv.x-Page_438"></a>ing also upon his shoulders a cross, to whom the holy fathers said:  Who art thou, who hast the look of a robber; and what is the cross which thou bearest upon thy shoulders?  He answered:  I, as you say, was a robber and a thief in the world, and for these things the Jews laid hold of me, and delivered me to the death of the cross, along with our Lord Jesus Christ.  While, then, He was hanging upon the cross, I, seeing the miracles that were done, believed in Him, and entreated Him, and said, Lord, when Thou shalt be King, do not forget me.  And immediately He said to me, Amen, amen:  to-day, I say unto thee, shalt thou be with me in paradise.  Therefore I came to paradise carrying my cross; and finding the archangel Michael, I said to him, Our Lord Jesus, who has been crucified, has sent me here; bring me, therefore, to the gate of Eden.  And the flaming sword, seeing the sign of the cross, opened to me, and I went in.  Then the archangel says to me, Wait a little, for there cometh also the forefather of the race of men, Adam, with the just, that they too may come in.  And now, seeing you, I came to meet you.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiv.x-p3"></a>The saints hearing these things, all cried out with a loud voice:  Great is our Lord, and great is His strength. <a name="fr_1951"></a><a href="#fn_1951"><font size="1">1952</font></a>
