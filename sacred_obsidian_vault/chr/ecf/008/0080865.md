 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.vii-p2"></a>“Neither, therefore, are the Hebrews condemned on account of their ignorance of Jesus, by reason of Him who has concealed Him, if, doing the things <i>commanded</i> by Moses, they do not hate Him whom they do not know.  Neither are those from among the Gentiles condemned, who know not Moses on account of Him who hath concealed him, provided that these also, doing the things spoken by Jesus, do not hate Him whom they do not know.  And some will not be profited by calling the teachers lords, but not doing the works of servants.  For on this account our Jesus Himself said to one who often called Him Lord, but did none of the things which He prescribed, Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? <a name="fr_1093"></a><a href="#fn_1093"><font size="1">1094</font></a>
   For it is not saying that will profit any one, but doing.  By all means, therefore, is there need of good works.  Moreover, if any one has been thought worthy to recognise both as preaching one doctrine, that man has been counted rich in God, understanding both the old things as new in time, and the new things as old.”</p>
