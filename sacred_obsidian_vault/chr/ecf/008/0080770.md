 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.ix-p2"></a>“Wherefore, before beginning our conversation, let us now withdraw into some quieter place, and there I shall converse with you.  And the reason why I wish to speak privately is this, because neither the multitude, nor even all the philosophers, approach honestly to the judgment of things as they are.  For we know many, even of those who pride themselves on their philosophy, who are vainglorious, or who have put on the philosophers robe for the sake of gain, and not for the sake of virtue itself; and they, if they do not find that for which they take to philosophy, turn to mockery.  Therefore, on account of such as these, let us choose some place fit for private conference.”</p>
