 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lx-p2"></a>Then Peter, moved with compassion, promised that he would restore the face of our father, saying to him:  “Listen, Faustinianus:  As soon as the error of your transformed countenance shall have conferred some advantage on us, and <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lx-Page_208"></a>shall have subserved the designs which we have in view, then I shall restore to you the true form of your countenance; on condition, however, that you first despatch what I shall command you.”  And when my father promised that he would with all his might fulfil everything that he might charge him with, provided only that he might recover his own countenance, Peter thus began:  “You have heard with your own ears, that one of those who had been sent before has returned from Antioch, and told us how Simon, while he was there, stirred up the multitudes against me, and inflamed the whole city into hatred of me, declaring that I am a magician, and a murderer, and a deceiver, so that they are eager, if they see me, even to eat my flesh.  Do therefore what I tell you:  leave Clement with me, and go before us to Antioch, with your wife, and your sons Faustus and Faustinus.  And I shall also send others with you, whom I think fit, who shall observe whatsoever I command them.</p>
