 </p><p class="c33"><a name="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1"></a> <span class="c12"><a name="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXI</span>.—<i>The purpose</i> <a name="fr_2628"></a><a href="#fn_2628"><font size="1">2629</font></a>
 <i>for which God in His foreknowledge created persons who would sin and not repent.</i></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iv.xxi-p3"></a>God in His goodness <a name="fr_2629"></a><a href="#fn_2629"><font size="1">2630</font></a>
  brought what exists into being out of nothing, and has foreknowledge of what will exist in the future. If, therefore, they were not to exist in the future, they would neither be evil in the future nor would they be foreknown. For knowledge is of what exists and foreknowledge is of what will surely exist in the future. For simple being comes first and then good or evil being. But if the very existence of those, who through the goodness of God are in the future to exist, were to be prevented by the fact that they were to become evil of their own choice, evil would have prevailed over the goodness of God. Wherefore God makes all His works good, but each becomes of its own choice good or evil. Although, then, the Lord said, <i>Good were it for that man that he had never been born</i> <a name="fr_2630"></a><a href="#fn_2630"><font size="1">2631</font></a>
 , He said it in condemnation not of His own creation but of the evil which His own creation had acquired by his own choice and through his own heedlessness. For the heedlessness that marks mans judgment made His Creators beneficence of no profit to him. It is just as if any one, when he had obtained riches and dominion from a king, were to lord it over his benefactor, who, when he has worsted him, will punish him as he deserves, if he should see him keeping hold of the sovereignty to the end.</p>
