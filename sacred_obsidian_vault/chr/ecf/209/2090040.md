 </p><p class="c33"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p1"></a> <span class="c12"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>Concerning the nature of Deity:  that it is incomprehensible.</i></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p2"></a>It is plain, then, that there is a God. But what He is in His essence and nature is absolutely incomprehensible and unknowable. For it is evident that He is incorporeal <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">1436</font></a>
 . For how could that possess body which is infinite, and boundless, and formless, and intangible and invisible, in short, simple and not compound? How could that be immutable <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">1437</font></a>
  which is circumscribed and subject to passion? And how could that be passionless which is composed of elements and is resolved again into them? For combination <a name="fr_1437"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">1438</font></a>
  is the beginning of conflict, and conflict of separation, and separation of dissolution, and dissolution is altogether foreign to God <a name="fr_1438"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">1439</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p7"></a>Again, how will it also be maintained <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">1440</font></a>
  that God permeates and fills the universe? as the Scriptures say, <i>Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord</i> <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">1441</font></a>
 ? For it is an impossibility <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">1442</font></a>
  that one body should permeate other bodies without dividing and being divided, and without being enveloped and contrasted, in the same way as all fluids mix and commingle.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p11"></a>But if some say that the body is immaterial, in the same way as the fifth body <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
  of which the Greek philosophers speak (which body is an impossibility), it will be wholly subject to motion like the heaven. For that is what they mean by the fifth body. Who then is it that moves it? For everything that is moved is moved by another thing. And who again is it that moves that? and so on to infinity till we at length arrive at something motionless. For the first mover is motionless, and that is the Deity. And must not that which is moved be circumscribed in space? The Deity, then, alone is motionless, moving the universe by immobility <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">1444</font></a>
 . So then it must be assumed that the Deity is incorporeal.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p14"></a>But even this gives no true idea of His essence, to say that He is unbegotten, and without beginning, changeless and imperishable, and possessed of such other qualities as we are wont to ascribe to God and His environment <a name="fr_1444"></a><a href="#fn_1444"><font size="1">1445</font></a>
 . For these do not indicate what He is, but what He is not <a name="fr_1445"></a><a href="#fn_1445"><font size="1">1446</font></a>
 . But when we would explain what <a name="page_4b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4b</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.i.iv-Page_4b"></a>the essence of anything is, we must not speak only negatively. In the case of God, however, it is impossible to explain what He is in His essence, and it befits us the rather to hold discourse about His absolute separation from all things <a name="fr_1446"></a><a href="#fn_1446"><font size="1">1447</font></a>
 . For He does not belong to the class of existing things:  not that He has no existence <a name="fr_1447"></a><a href="#fn_1447"><font size="1">1448</font></a>
 , but that He is above all existing things, nay even above existence itself. For if all forms of knowledge have to do with what exists, assuredly that which is above knowledge must certainly be also above essence <a name="fr_1448"></a><a href="#fn_1448"><font size="1">1449</font></a>
 :  and, conversely, that which is above essence <a name="fr_1449"></a><a href="#fn_1449"><font size="1">1450</font></a>
  will also be above knowledge.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p21"></a>God then is infinite and incomprehensible and all that is comprehensible about Him is His infinity and incomprehensibility. But all that we can affirm concerning God does not shew forth Gods nature, but only the qualities of His nature <a name="fr_1450"></a><a href="#fn_1450"><font size="1">1451</font></a>
 . For when you speak of Him as good, and just, and wise, and so forth, you do not tell Gods nature but only the qualities of His nature <a name="fr_1451"></a><a href="#fn_1451"><font size="1">1452</font></a>
 . Further there are some affirmations which we make concerning God which have the force of absolute negation:  for example, when we use the term darkness, in reference to God, we do not mean darkness itself, but that He is not light but above light:  and when we speak of Him as light, we mean that He is not darkness.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p12"></a> The reference is to the Pythagorean and Aristotelian ideas of the heavens as being like the body of Deity, something uncorrupt, different from the four elements, and therefore called a <i>fifth body</i>, or <i>element </i>(<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p12.1"></a>στοιχεῖον</span>). In his <i>Meteor</i>. i. 3, <i>De Cœlo </i>i. 3, &amp;c., Aristotle speaks of the Ether as extending from the heaven of the fixed stars down to the moon, as of a nature specially adapted for circular motion, as the first element in rank, but as the <i>fifth</i>, “if we enumerate beginning with the elements directly known by the senses.…the subsequently so-called <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.iv.i.iv-p12.2"></a>πέμπτον στοιχεῖον</span>, <i>quinta essentia</i>.” The other elements, he taught, had the upward motion, or the downward:  the earth having the attribute of heaviness, and its natural place in the world being the lowest; fire being the light element, and “its place the sphere next adjoining the sphere of the ether.” See Ueberwegs <i>History of Philosophy</i>, Vol. I. p. 167, Morriss translation, and the chapter on the De Cœlo in Grotes Aristotle, Vol. II. pp. 389, &amp;c.</p>
