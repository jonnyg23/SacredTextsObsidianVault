 </p><p class="c33"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p1"></a> <span class="c12"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XIII</span>.—<i>Concerning the properties of the two Natures.</i></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></a>Confessing, then, the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, to be perfect God and perfect man, we hold that the same has all the attributes of the Father save that of being ingenerate, and all the attributes of the first Adam, save only his sin, these attributes being body and the intelligent and rational soul; and further that He has, corresponding to the two natures, the two sets of natural qualities belonging to the two natures:  two natural volitions, one divine and one human, two natural energies, one divine and one human, two natural free-wills, one divine and one human, and two kinds of wisdom and knowledge, one divine and one human. For being of like essence with God and the Father, He wills and energises freely as God, and being also of like essence with us He likewise wills and energises freely as man. For His are the miracles and His also are the passive states.</p>
