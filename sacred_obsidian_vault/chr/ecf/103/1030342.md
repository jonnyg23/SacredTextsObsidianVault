 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xciv-p2"></a>But as for those who, out of the mass of perdition caused by the first mans sin, are not redeemed through the one Mediator between God and man, they too shall rise again, each with his own body, but only to be punished with the devil and his angels. Now, whether they shall rise again with all their diseases and deformities of body, bringing with them the diseased and deformed limbs which they possessed here, it would be labor lost to inquire. For we need not weary ourselves speculating about their health or their beauty, which are matters uncertain, when their eternal damnation is a matter of certainty. Nor need we inquire in what sense their body shall be incorruptible, if it be susceptible of pain; or in what sense corruptible, if it be free from the possibility of death. For there is no true life except where there is happiness in life, and no true incorruption except where health is unbroken by any pain. When, however, the unhappy are not permitted to die, then, if I may so speak, death itself dies not; and where pain without intermission afflicts the <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xciv-Page_267"></a>soul, and never comes to an end, corruption itself is not completed. This is called in Holy Scripture “the second death.” <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">1273</font></a>
