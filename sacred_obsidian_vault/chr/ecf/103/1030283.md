 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xxxv-p2"></a>And so the human race was lying under a just condemnation, and all men were the children of wrath. Of which wrath it is written: “All our days are passed away in Thy wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told.” <a name="fr_1139"></a><a href="#fn_1139"><font size="1">1140</font></a>
  Of which wrath also Job says: “Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.” <a name="fr_1140"></a><a href="#fn_1140"><font size="1">1141</font></a>
  Of which wrath also the Lord Jesus says: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1141"><font size="1">1142</font></a>
  He does not say it will come, but it “abideth on him.” For every man is born with it; wherefore the apostle says: “We were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.” <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="#fn_1142"><font size="1">1143</font></a>
  Now, as men were lying under this wrath by reason of their original sin, and as this original sin was the <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xxxv-Page_249"></a>more heavy and deadly in proportion to the number and magnitude of the actual sins which were added to it, there was need for a Mediator, that is, for a reconciler, who, by the offering of one sacrifice, of which all the sacrifices of the law and the prophets were types, should take away this wrath. Wherefore the apostle says: “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” <a name="fr_1143"></a><a href="#fn_1143"><font size="1">1144</font></a>
  Now when God is said to be angry, we do not attribute to Him such a disturbed feeling as exists in the mind of an angry man; but we call His just displeasure against sin by the name “anger,” a word transferred by analogy from human emotions. But our being reconciled to God through a Mediator, and receiving the Holy Spirit, so that we who were enemies are made sons (“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God” <a name="fr_1144"></a><a href="#fn_1144"><font size="1">1145</font></a>
 ): this is the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
