 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.xi.i-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.xi.i-p1.1"></a>Chapter 1.—In What Way We Must Inquire Concerning the Trinity.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xi.i-p2"></a>1. <span class="c19"><a name="iv.i.xi.i-p2.1"></a>We</span> certainly seek a trinity,—not any trinity, but that Trinity which is God, and the true and supreme and only God. Let my hearers then wait, for we are still seeking. And no one justly finds fault with such a search, if at least he who seeks that which either to know or to utter is most difficult, is steadfast in the faith. But whosoever either sees or teaches better, finds fault quickly and justly with any one who confidently affirms concerning it. “Seek God,” he says, “and your heart shall live;” <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">696</font></a>
  and lest any one should rashly rejoice that he has, as it were, apprehended it, “Seek,” he says, “His face evermore.” <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">697</font></a>
  And the apostle: “If any man,” he says, “think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the same is known of Him.” <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">698</font></a>
  He has not said, has known Him, which is dangerous presumption, but “is known of Him.” So also in another place, when he had said, “But now after that ye have known God:” immediately correcting himself, he says, “or rather are known of God.” <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">699</font></a>
  And above all in that other place, “Brethren,” he says, “I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press in purpose <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">700</font></a>
  toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.” <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">701</font></a>
  Perfection in this life, he tells us, is nothing else than to forget those things which are behind, and to reach forth and press in purpose toward those things which are before. For he that seeks has the safest purpose, [who seeks] until that is taken hold of whither we are tending, and for which we are reaching forth. But that is the right purpose which starts from faith. For a certain faith is in some way the starting-point of knowledge; but a certain knowledge will not be made perfect, except after this life, when we shall see face to face. <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">702</font></a>
  Let us therefore be thus minded, so as to know that the disposition to seek the truth is more safe than that which presumes things unknown to be known. Let us therefore so seek as if we should find, and so find as if we were about to seek. For “when a man hath done, then he beginneth.” <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">703</font></a>
  Let us doubt without unbelief of things to be believed; let us affirm without rashness of things to be understood: authority must be held fast in the former, truth sought out in the latter. As regards this question, then, let us believe that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one God, the Creator and Ruler of the whole creature; and that the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit either the Father or the Son, but a trinity of persons mutually interrelated, and a unity of an equal essence. And let us seek to understand this, praying for help from Himself, whom we wish to understand; and as much as He grants, desiring to explain what we understand with so much pious care and anxiety, that even if in any case we say one thing for another, we may at least say nothing unworthy. As, for the sake of example, if we say anything concerning the Father that does not properly belong to the Father, or does belong to the Son, or to the  <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a> <a name="iv.i.xi.i-Page_126"></a>Holy Spirit, or to the Trinity itself; and if anything of the Son which does not properly suit with the Son, or at all events which does suit with the Father, or with the Holy Spirit, or with the Trinity; or if, again, anything concerning the Holy Spirit, which is not fitly a property of the Holy Spirit, yet is not alien from the Father, or from the Son, or from the one God the Trinity itself. Even as now our wish is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that love which is most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, “God is love.” <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">704</font></a>
  And yet we ought not to deviate into profane error, so as to say anything of the Trinity which does not suit the Creator, but rather the creature, or which is feigned outright by mere empty thought.</p>
