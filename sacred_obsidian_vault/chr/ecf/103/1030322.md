 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.lxxiv-p1"></a>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.lxxiv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 72.—There are Many Kinds of Alms, the Giving of Which Assists to Procure Pardon for Our Sins.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.lxxiv-p2"></a>And on this principle of interpretation, our Lords saying, “Give alms of such things as ye have, and, behold, all things are clean unto you,” <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">1232</font></a>
  applies to every useful act that a man does in mercy. Not only, then, the man who gives food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, hospitality to the stranger, shelter to the fugitive, who visits the sick and the imprisoned, ransoms the captive, assists the weak, leads the blind, comforts the sorrowful, heals the sick, puts the wanderer on the right path, gives advice to the perplexed, and supplies the wants of the needy,—not this man only, but the man who pardons the sinner also gives alms; and the man who corrects with blows, or restrains by any kind of discipline one over whom he has power, and who at the same time forgives from the heart the sin by which he was injured, or prays that it may be forgiven, is also a giver of alms, not only in that he forgives, or prays for forgiveness for the sin, but also in that he rebukes and corrects the sinner: for in this, too, he shows mercy. Now much good is bestowed upon unwilling recipients, when their advantage and not their pleasure is consulted; and they themselves <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.lxxiv-Page_261"></a>frequently prove to be their own enemies, while their true friends are those whom they take for their enemies, and to whom in their blindness they return evil for good. (A Christian, indeed, is not permitted to return evil even for evil. <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">1233</font></a>
 ) And thus there are many kinds of alms, by giving of which we assist to procure the pardon of our sins.</p>
