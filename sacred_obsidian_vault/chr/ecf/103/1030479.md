 </p><p class="c10"><a name="iv.vii.xv-p1"></a>  15. “Forgiveness of sins.” Ye have [this article of] the Creed perfectly in you when ye receive Baptism. Let none say, “I have done this or that sin: perchance that is not forgiven me.” What hast thou done? How great a sin hast thou done? Name any heinous thing thou hast committed, heavy, horrible, which thou shudderest even to think of: have done what thou wilt: hast thou killed Christ? There is not than that deed any worse, because also than Christ there is nothing better. What a dreadful thing is it to kill Christ! Yet the Jews killed Him, and many afterwards believed on Him and drank His blood: they are forgiven the sin which they committed. When ye have been baptized, hold fast a good life in the commandments of God, that ye may guard your Baptism even unto the end. I do not tell you that ye will live here without sin; but they are venial, without which this life is not. For the sake of all sins was Baptism provided; for the sake of light sins, without which we cannot be, was prayer provided. <a name="fr_1802"></a><a href="#fn_1802"><font size="1">1803</font></a>
  What hath <a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 375</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.xv-Page_375"></a>the Prayer? “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” <a name="fr_1803"></a><a href="#fn_1803"><font size="1">1804</font></a>
  Once for all we have washing in Baptism, every day we have washing in prayer. Only, do not commit those things for which ye must needs be separated from Christs body: which be far from you! For those whom ye have seen doing penance, <a name="fr_1804"></a><a href="#fn_1804"><font size="1">1805</font></a>
  have committed heinous things, either adulteries or some enormous crimes: for these they do penance. Because if theirs had been light sins, to blot out these daily prayer would suffice.</p>
