 <p> <a name="v.viii.i"></a>
 </p><p class="c49"><a name="v.viii.i-p1"></a> Erasmus infers from the style and language of this piece, that it is not S. Augustins, putting it in the same category with the treatises <i>On Continence, On substance of Charity, On Faith of things invisible.</i> The Benedictine editors acknowledge that it has peculiarities of style which are calculated to move suspicion; (especially the studied assonances and rhyming endings, e.g. “<i>cautior fuit iste in doloribus quam ille in nemoribus . . . consensit ille oblectamentis, non cessit ille tormentis</i>,” chap. 12.); yet they feel themselves bound to retain it among the genuine works by Augustins own testimony, who mentions both this piece and that <i>On Continence</i> in his Epistle to Darius, 231. chap. 7. [Vol. I. 584.] That it is not named in the <i>Retractations</i> is accounted for by the circumstance that it appears to have been delivered as a sermon, see chap. 1. and 3, and Augustin did not live to fulfill his intention of composing a further book of retractations on review of his popular discourses and letters. <i> Ep</i>. 224. chap. 2. In point of matter and doctrine this treatise has nothing contrary to or not in harmony with S. Augustins known doctrine and sentiments.</p>
