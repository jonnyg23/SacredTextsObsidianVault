 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xlvii-p2"></a>However, even in that one sin, which “by one man entered into the world, and so passed upon all men,” <a name="fr_1165"></a><a href="#fn_1165"><font size="1">1166</font></a>
  and on account of which infants are baptized, a number of distinct sins may be observed, if it be analyzed as it were into its separate elements. For there is in it pride, because man chose to be under his own dominion, rather than under the dominion of God; and blasphemy, because he did not believe God; and murder, for he brought death upon himself; and spiritual fornication, for the purity of the human soul was corrupted by the seducing blandishments of the serpent; and theft, for man turned to his own use the food he had been forbidden to touch; and avarice, for he had a craving for more than should have been sufficient for him; and whatever other sin can be discovered on careful reflection to be involved in this one admitted sin.</p>
