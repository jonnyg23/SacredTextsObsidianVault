 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xxviii-p1"></a>  27. There are some things of this sort even of our Saviour in the Gospel, because the Lord of the Prophets deigned to be Himself also a Prophet. Such are those where, concerning the woman which had an issue of blood, He said, “Who touched Me?” <a name="fr_2430"></a><a href="#fn_2430"><font size="1">2431</font></a>
  and of Lazarus. “Where have ye laid him?” <a name="fr_2431"></a><a href="#fn_2431"><font size="1">2432</font></a>
  He asked, namely, as if not knowing that which in any wise He knew. And He did on this account feign that He knew not, that He might signify somewhat else by that His seeming ignorance: and since this signification was truthful, it was assuredly not a lie. For those were signified, whether by her which had the issue, or by him which had been four days dead, whom even He Who knew all things did in a certain sort know not. For both she bore the type of the people of the Gentiles, whereof the prophecy had gone before, “A people whom I have not known hath served Me:” <a name="fr_2432"></a><a href="#fn_2432"><font size="1">2433</font></a>
  and Lazarus, removed from the living, did as it were in that place lie in significative similitude where He lay, Whose voice that is, “I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.” <a name="fr_2433"></a><a href="#fn_2433"><font size="1">2434</font></a>
  And with that intent, as though it were not known by Christ, both who she was and where he was laid, by His words of interrogating a figure was enacted and by truthful signification all lying left apart.</p>
