 </p><p class="c28"><a name="v.ix.iv-p1"></a>  3. Possibly thy inquiry is satisfied by this my brief reply. But what other considerations move me, to which I think meet to answer, do thou for a short space attend. In the books of the Maccabees we read of sacrifice offered for the dead. <a name="fr_2712"></a><a href="#fn_2712"><font size="1">2713</font></a>
  Howbeit even if it were no where at all read in the Old Scriptures, not small is the authority, which in this usage is clear, of the whole Church, namely, that in the prayers of the priest which are offered to the Lord God at His altar, the Commendation of the dead hath also its place. But then, whether there be some profit accruing unto the soul of the dead from the place of its body, requires a more careful inquiry. And first, whether it make any difference in causing or increasing of misery after this life to the spirits of men if their bodies be not buried, this must be looked into, not in the light of opinion however commonly received, but rather of the holy writ of our religion. For we are not to credit that, as is read in Maro, the unburied are prohibited from navigating and crossing the infernal stream: because forsooth</p>  
 <p class="c29"><a name="v.ix.iv-p3"></a>“To none is givn to pass the hideous banks</p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="v.ix.iv-p4"></a>And waters hoarse, ere in their meet abode</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="v.ix.iv-p5"></a>The bones have sunk to rest.” <a name="fr_2713"></a><a href="#fn_2713"><font size="1">2714</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.ix.iv-p7"></a>Who can incline a Christian heart to these poetical and fabulous figments, when the Lord Jesus, to the intent that under the hands of their enemies, who should have their bodies in their power, Christians might lie down without a fear, asserts that not a hair of their head shall perish, exhorting that they should not fear them which when they have killed the body have nothing more that they can do? <a name="fr_2714"></a><a href="#fn_2714"><font size="1">2715</font></a>
  Of which in the first book “On the City of God,” I have methinks enough spoken, to break the teeth in their mouths who, in imputing to Christian times the barbarous devastation, especially that which Rome has lately suffered, do cast up to us this also, that Christ did not there come to the succor of His own. To whom when it is answered that the souls of the faithful were, according to the merits of their faith, by Him taken into protection, they insult over us with talking of their corpses left unburied. All this matter, then, concerning burial I have in such words as these expounded.</p>
