Whence they are marvellously void of wisdom, who think that the good of this continence is not necessary for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, but for the sake of the present world: in that, forsooth, married persons are strained different ways by earthly cares more and more straitened, from which trouble virgins and continent persons are free: as though on this account only it were better not to be married, that the straits of this present time may be escaped, not that it is of any profit unto a future life. And, that they may not seem to have put forth this vain opinion from out the vanity of their own heart, they take the Apostle to witness, where he saith, “But concerning virgins I have not command of the Lord, but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy from God to be faithful. Therefore I think that this is good on account of the present necessity, because it is good for a man so to be.” <a name="fr_2044"></a><a href="#fn_2044"><font size="1">2045</font></a>

As though the Apostle would have regard for the present necessity, otherwise than as providing and consulting for the future; whereas all his dealing <a name="fr_2045"></a><a href="#fn_2045"><font size="1">2046</font></a>
  calls not save unto life eternal.</p>
