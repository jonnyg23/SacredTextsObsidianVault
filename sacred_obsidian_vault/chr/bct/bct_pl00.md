 <p><small>Sumerian relief in copper on wood representing <b>Imdugud</b>, or <b>Imgig</b>, the lion-headed eagle of Ningirsu, the great god of Lagash, grasping two stags by their tails. It is probable that it was originally placed over the door of the temple of Nin-khursag or Damgalnun at the head of the stairway leading on to the temple platform. This remarkable monument was made about 3100 <small>B.C.</small>, and was discovered by Dr. H. R. Hall in 1919 at <b>Tall al-`Ubêd</b>, a sanctuary at "Ur of the Chaldees" in Lower Babylonia. It is now in the British Museum (No. 114308).</small></p>
