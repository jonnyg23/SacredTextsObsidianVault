 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Works of St. Anselm</i>, tr. by Sidney Norton Deane, [1903], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="v.XVI"></a> 		  <h3 align="center"><a name="v.XVI-p0.1"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>   		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XVI-p2"></a>For this Being it is the same to be just that it is to be justice; and so with regard to attributes that can be expressed in the same way: and none of these shows of what character, or how great, but what this Being is.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p3"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XVI-p4"></a>BUT perhaps, when this Being is called just, or great, or anything like these, it is not shown what it is, but of what character, or how great it is. For <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a> <a name="v.XVI-Page_64"></a>every such term seems to be used with reference to quantity or magnitude; because everything that is just is so through justness, and so with other like cases, in the same way. Hence, the supreme Nature itself is not just, except through justness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p5"></a>It seems, then, that by <i>participation</i> in this quality, that is, justness, the supremely good Substance is called just. But, if this is so, it is just through another, and not through itself. But this is contrary to the truth already established, that it is good, or great or whatever it is at all, through itself and not through another. So, if it is not just, except through justness, and cannot be just, except through itself, what can be more clear than that 			 this Nature is itself justness? And, when it is said to be just through justness, it is the same as saying that it is just through itself. And, when it is said to be just through itself, nothing else is understood than that it is just through justness. Hence, if it is inquired what the supreme Nature, which is in question, is in itself, what truer answer can be given, than <i>Justness</i>?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p6"></a>We must observe, then, how we are to understand the statement, that the Nature which is itself justness is just. For, since a man cannot be justness, but can possess justness, we do not conceive of a just man as <i>being</i> justness, but as possessing justness. Since, on the other hand, it cannot properly be said of the supreme Nature that it possesses justness, but that it is justness, when it is called just it is properly conceived of as being justness, but not 			 as possessing justness. Hence, if, when it is said to be justness, it is not said of what character it is, but <i>what</i> it is, it follows that, when it is called just, it is not said of what character it is, but what it is.</p> 		  <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a> <a name="v.XVI-Page_65"></a>   		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p7"></a>Therefore, seeing that it is the same to say of the supreme Being, that it is just and that it is justness; and, when it is said that it is justness, it is nothing else than saying that it is just; it makes no difference whether it is said to be justness or to be just. Hence, when one is asked regarding the supreme Nature, what it is, the answer, <i>Just</i>, is not less fitting than the answer, <i>Justness</i>. Moreover, what we see to have been proved in the case 			 of justness, the intellect is compelled to acknowledge as true of all attributes which are similarly predicated of this supreme Nature. Whatever such attribute is predicated of it, then, it is shown, not of what character, or how great, but <i>what</i> it is.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XVI-p8"></a>But it is obvious that whatever good thing the supreme Nature is, it is in the highest degree. It is, therefore, supreme Being, supreme Justness, supreme Wisdom, supreme Truth, supreme Goodness, supreme Greatness, supreme Beauty, supreme Immortality, supreme Incorruptibility, supreme Immutability, supreme Blessedness, supreme Eternity, supreme Power, supreme Unity; which is nothing else than supremely being, supremely living, etc.</p>
