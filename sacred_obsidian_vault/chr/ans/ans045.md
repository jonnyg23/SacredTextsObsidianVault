 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Works of St. Anselm</i>, tr. by Sidney Norton Deane, [1903], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="v.XII"></a> 		  <h3 align="center"><a name="v.XII-p0.1"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

 </p><p><a name="v.XII-p2"></a>This expression of the supreme Being is the supreme Being.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XII-p3"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XII-p4"></a>BUT since, as our reasoning shows, it is equally certain that whatever the supreme Substance created, it created through nothing other than itself; and whatever it created, it created through its own most intimate expression, whether separately, by the utterance of separate words, or all at once, by the utterance of one word; what conclusion can be more evidently necessary, than that this expression of the supreme Being is no other than the supreme Being? Therefore, 			 the consideration of this expression should not, in my opinion, be carelessly passed over. But before it can be discussed, I think some of the properties <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a> <a name="v.XII-Page_59"></a>of this supreme Substance should be diligently and earnestly investigated.</p>
