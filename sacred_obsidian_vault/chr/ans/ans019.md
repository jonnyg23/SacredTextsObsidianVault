 <p><a name="iv.XIII-p2"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XIII-p3"></a>How he alone is uncircumscribed and eternal, although other spirits are uncircumscribed and eternal. ‑‑No place and time contain God. But he is himself everywhere and always. He alone not only does not cease to be, but also does not begin to be.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XIII-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XIII-p5"></a>BUT everything that is in any way bounded by place or time is less than that which no law of place or time limits. Since, then, nothing is greater than thou, no place or time contains thee; but thou art everywhere and always. And since this can be said of thee alone, thou alone art uncircumscribed and eternal.How is it, then, that other spirits also are said to be uncircumscribed and eternal?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XIII-p6"></a>Assuredly thou art alone eternal; for thou alone among all beings not only dost not cease to be but also dost not begin to be.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XIII-p7"></a>But how art thou alone uncircumscribed? Is it that a created spirit, when compared with thee is circumscribed, but when compared with matter, uncircumscribed? For altogether circumscribed is that which, when it is wholly in one place, cannot at the same time be in another. And this is seen to be true of corporeal things alone. But uncircumscribed is that which is, as a whole, at the same time everywhere. And this is understood to be true of thee alone. But 			 circumscribed, and, at the same time, uncircumscribed is that which, when it is anywhere as a whole, can at the same time be somewhere else as a whole, and yet not everywhere. And this is recognised as true of created spirits. For, if the soul were not as a whole in the separate members of the body, it would not feel as a whole in the separate members. Therefore, thou, Lord, art peculiarly uncircumscribed and eternal; and yet other spirits also are uncircumscribed and eternal.</p>
