 <p><a name="v.XXXV-p2"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XXXV-p3"></a>Whatever has been created is in his Word and knowledge, life and truth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXXV-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XXXV-p5"></a>BUT, since it is established that his word is consubstantial with him, and perfectly like him, it necessarily follows that all things that exist in him exist also, and in the same way, in his Word. Whatever has been created, then, whether alive or not alive, or howsoever it exists in itself, is very life and truth in him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXXV-p6"></a>But, since knowing is the same to the supreme Spirit as conceiving or expressing, he must know all things that he knows in the same way in which he expresses or conceives of them. Therefore, just as all things are in his Word life and truth, so are they in his knowledge.</p>
