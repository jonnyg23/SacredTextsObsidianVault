 <p><a name="iv.VI-p2"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.VI-p3"></a>How God is sensible (<a name="iv.VI-p3.3"></a>sensibilis) although he is not a body. ‑‑God is sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless; for it is better to be these than not be. He who in any way knows, is not improperly said in some sort to feel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.VI-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.VI-p5"></a>BUT, although it is better for thee to be sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless, than not to be these things; how art thou sensible, if thou art not a body; or omnipotent, if thou hast not all powers; or at once compassionate and passionless? For, if only corporeal things are sensible, since the senses encompass a body and are in a body, how art thou sensible, although thou art not a body, but a supreme Spirit, who is superior to body? But, if feeling is 			 only cognition, or for the sake of cognition, ‑‑for he who feels obtains knowledge in accordance with the proper functions of his senses; as through sight, of colors; through taste, of flavors, ‑‑whatever in any way cognises is not inappropriately said, in some sort, to feel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.VI-p6"></a>Therefore, O Lord, although thou art not a body yet thou art truly sensible in the highest degree in respect of this, that thou dost cognise all things in the highest degree; and not as an animal cognises, through a corporeal sense.</p>
