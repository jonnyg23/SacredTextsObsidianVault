 </p><p><a name="iv.XXIV-p3"></a>Conjecture as to the character and the magnitude of this good. ‑‑If the created life is good, how good is the creative life!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XXIV-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XXIV-p5"></a>AND now, my soul, arouse and lift up all thy understanding, and conceive, so far as thou canst, of what character and how great is that good! For, if individual goods are delectable, conceive in earnestness how delectable is that good which contains the pleasantness of all goods; and not such as we have experienced in created objects, but as different as the Creator from the creature. For, if the created life is good, how good is the creative life! If the salvation 			 given is delightful, how delightful is the salvation which has given all salvation! If wisdom in the knowledge of the created world is lovely, how lovely is the wisdom which has created all things from nothing! Finally, if there are many great delights in delectable things, what and how great is the delight in him who has made these delectable things.</p>
