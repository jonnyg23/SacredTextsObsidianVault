 <p> </p>  <h3 align="center">SHOWING HOW THE ESTABLISHED MAN SHALL GO OUT IN FOUR WAYS</h3>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>Now the man who is established in the bonds of love shall dwell in the unity of the spirit; and he shall go out with enlightened reason and with overflowing love in heaven and on earth; and he shall mark all things with clear discernment; and he shall dispense and distribute all things, out of true generosity, and because of his richness in God.</p>  
 <p>In four ways this enlightened man is invited and urged to go out. The first going out shall be towards God and towards all saints; the second going out shall be towards sinners and towards all perverted men; the third going out shall be towards purgatory; and the fourth, towards himself and towards all good men.</p>
