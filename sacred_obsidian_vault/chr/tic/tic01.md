 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Interior Castle</i>, by St. Teresa of Avila, [1921], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">NOTE</h3>  
 <p>IN this new edition the wording has been revised I and condensed, chiefly with a view to rendering the translation more pregnant. Only one passage (VI. Mansion, ch. v. 13) has been substantially changed, in conformity with an explanation received from a high authority. It is admittedly a very difficult passage which appears to have been misunderstood by nearly all translators; but it is gratifying to notice that the new French translation by the Carmelite nuns of Anderlecht agrees with our interpretation. The editor is under an obligation to that translation for several interesting facts embodied in the Introduction and in the notes to the text.</p>
