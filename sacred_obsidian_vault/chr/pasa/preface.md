 Neville Figgis was allowed to carry through. He prepared them for the press,
 leaving them in the form of lectures and preserving here and there the impress
 which the anxiety of war-crisis made upon them. In that form, therefore, they
 are published now. In place of the final revision which his failing health
 prevented him from making, another hand has tried unskilfully to supply what he
 would have done with skill, in order to carry out his wishes and make his last
 complete piece of work accessible to a wider public than those who heard the
 lectures delivered.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><p>
