 <p></p><p><a name="pg_vi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. vi</font></a></p><p></p><p>To those leaning on the sustaining infinite, to-day is
 big with blessings. The wakeful shepherd beholds
 the first faint morning beams, ere cometh the full radiance
 of a risen day. So shone the pale star to the prophetshepherds; yet it traversed the night, and came where, in
 cradled obscurity, lay the Bethlehem babe, the human
 herald of Christ, Truth, who would make plain to benighted understanding the way of salvation through Christ
 Jesus, till across a night of error should dawn the morning beams and shine the guiding star of being. The Wisemen were led to behold and to follow this daystar of
 divine Science, lighting the way to eternal harmony. 
  
 The time for thinkers has come. Truth, independent
 of doctrines and time-honored systems, knocks at the
 portal of humanity. Contentment with the past and 
 the cold conventionality of materialism are crumbling
 away. Ignorance of God is no longer the steppingstone to faith. The only guarantee of obedience is a
 right apprehension of Him whom to know aright is
 Life eternal. Though empires fall, "the Lord shall
 reign forever."  
          
 A book introduces new thoughts, but it cannot make
 them speedily understood.  It is the task of the sturdy
 pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough
 granite. Future ages must declare what the pioneer
 has accomplished.
 </p><p></p><p>Since the author's discovery of the might of Truth in 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_viii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. viii</font></a></p><p></p><p>the treatment of disease as well as of sin, her system has
 been fully tested and has not been found wanting; but
 to reach the heights of Christian Science, man must live
 in obedience to its divine Principle. To develop the full
 might of this Science, the discords of corporeal sense
 must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense, even as the
 science of music corrects false tones and gives sweet concord to sound.
 </p><p></p><p>Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and
 matter are real and good, whereas the fact is that
 Spirit is good and real, and matter is Spirit's opposite. The question, What is Truth, is answered by
 demonstration, by healing both disease and sin; and
 this demonstration shows that Christian healing confers the most health and makes the best men. On this
 basis Christian Science will have a fair fight. Sickness
 has been combated for centuries by doctors using material remedies; but the question arises, Is there less
 sickness because of these practitioners? A vigorous
 "No" is the response deducible from two connate
 facts,--the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians,
 and the rapid multiplication and increased violence of
 diseases since the flood.
 </p><p></p><p>In the author's work, RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPECTION, may be found a biographical sketch, narrating
 experiences which led her, in the year 1866, to the discovery of the system that she denominated Christian
 Science. As early as 1862 she began to write down and
 give to friends the results of her Scriptural study, for
 the Bible was her sole teacher; but these compositions
 were crude, the first steps of a child in the newly discovered world of Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_ix"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. ix</font></a></p><p></p><p>She also began to jot down her thoughts on the
 main subject, but these jottings were only infantile
 lispings of Truth. A child drinks in the outward world 
 through the eyes and rejoices in the draught. He is
 as sure of the world's existence as he is of his own; yet
 he cannot describe the world. He finds a few words, 
 and with these he stammeringly attempts to convey his
 feeling. Later, the tongue voices the more definite
 thought, though still imperfectly. 
      
 So was it with the author. As a certain poet says of
 himself, she "lisped in numbers, for the numbers
 came." Certain essays written at that early date are
 still in circulation among her first pupils; but they are
 feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of
 Christian healing, and are not complete nor satisfactory expositions of Truth. To-day, though rejoicing
 in some progress, she still finds herself a willing disciple at the heavenly gate, waiting for the Mind of 
 Christ.
 </p><p></p><p>Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copyrighted in 1870 ; but it did not appear in print until 
 1876, as she had learned that this Science must be
 demonstrated by healing, before a work on the subject
 could be profitably studied. From 1867 until 1875,
 copies were, however, in friendly circulation.
 </p><p></p><p>Before writing this work, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, she
 made copious notes of Scriptural exposition, which
 have never been published. This was during the years
 1867 and 1868. These efforts show her comparative
 ignorance of the stupendous Life-problem up to that 
 time, and the degrees by which she came at length
 to its solution; but she values them as a parent
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_x"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. x</font></a></p><p></p><p>may treasure the memorials of a child's growth, and
 she would not have them changed.
 </p><p></p><p>The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was published in 1875. Various books on mental healing have
 since been issued, most of them incorrect in theory
 and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH.
 They regard the human mind as a healing agent,
 whereas this mind is not a factor in the Principle of
 Christian Science. A few books, however, which are
 based on this book, are useful.
 </p><p></p><p>The author has not compromised conscience to suit
 the general drift of thought, but has bluntly and honestly given the text of Truth. She has made no effort
 to embellish, elaborate, or treat in full detail so infinite a theme. By thousands of well-authenticated
 cases of healing, she and her students have proved the
 worth of her teachings. These cases for the most part
 have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical
 attendants. Few invalids will turn to God till all
 physical supports have failed, because there is so little
 faith in His disposition and power to heal disease.
 </p><p></p><p>The divine Principle of healing is proved in the
 personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth. Its
 purpose is good, and its practice is safer and more potent than that of any other sanitary method. The unbiased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth,
 and convinced of it. Only those quarrel with her
 method who do not understand her meaning, or discerning the truth, come not to the light lest their
 works be reproved. No intellectual proficiency is requisite in the learner, but sound morals are most desirable.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_xi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xi</font></a></p><p></p><p>Many imagine that the phenomena of physical healing in Christian Science present only a phase of the
 action of the human mind, which action in some unexplained way results in the cure of disease. On the contrary, Christian Science rationally explains that all
 other pathological methods are the fruits of human 
 faith in matter, faith in the workings, not of Spirit,
 but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science.
 </p><p></p><p>The physical healing of Christian Science results
 now, as in Jesus' time, from the operation of divine
 Principle, before which sin and disease lose their reality in human consciousness and disappear as naturally
 and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and
 sin to reformation. Now, as then, these mighty works
 are not supernatural, but supremely natural. They are 
 the sign of Immanuel, or "God with us," a divine
 influence ever present in human consciousness and repeating itself, coming now as was promised aforetime, 
 </p><p></p><p>   To preach deliverance to the captives [of sense],<br>
    And recovering of sight to the blind,<br>
    To set at liberty them that are bruised.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel
 to this age, there came also the charge to plant and
 water His vineyard.        
 </p><p></p><p>The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing
 was started by the author with only one student in
 Lynn, Massachusetts, about the year 1867. In 1881, 
 she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in
 Boston, under the seal of the Commonwealth, a law
 relative to colleges having been passed, which enabled 
 her to get this institution chartered for medical pur</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_xii%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xii </font></a></p><p></p><p>poses. No charters were granted to Christian Scientists for such institutions after 1883, and up to that
 date, hers was the only College of this character which
 had been established in the United States, where
 Christian Science was first introduced.
 </p><p></p><p>During seven years over four thousand students
 were taught by the author in this College. Meanwhile
 she was pastor of the first established Church of
 Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Scientist Association, convening monthly; publisher of
 her own works; and (for a portion of this time) sole
 editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal,
 the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She
 closed her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of
 its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the
 next two years of her life should be given to the preparation of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which
 was published in 1891. She retained her charter, and
 as its President, reopened the College in 1899 as auxiliary to her church. Until June 10, 1907, she had never
 read this book throughout consecutively in order to elucidate her idealism.
 </p><p></p><p>In the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who "hopeth
 all things, endureth all things," and is joyful to bear
 consolation to the sorrowing and healing to the sick, 
 she commits these pages to honest seekers for Truth.
