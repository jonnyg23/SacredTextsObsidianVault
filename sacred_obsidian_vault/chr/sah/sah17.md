 <p></p><p><a name="pg_579"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 579</font></a></p><p></p><p>These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key
 of David, He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no
 man openeth; I know thy works : behold, I have set before thee an open
 door, and no man can shut it.--REVELATION.
 </p><p></p><p>In Christian Science we learn that the substitution of 
 the spiritual for the material definition of a Scriptural word often elucidates the meaning of the inspired 
 writer. On this account this chapter is added. It contains the metaphysical interpretation of Bible terms,
 giving their spiritual sense, which is also their original 
 meaning.
 </p><p></p><p>ABEL. Watchfulness; self-offering; surrendering to
 the creator the early fruits of experience.  
 </p><p></p><p>ABRAHAM. Fidelity; faith in the divine Life and in the
 eternal Principle of being.
 </p><p></p><p>This patriarch illustrated the purpose of Love to create 
 trust in good, and showed the life-preserving power of
 spiritual understanding.
 </p><p></p><p>ADAM. Error; a falsity; the belief in "original sin," 
 sickness, and death; evil; the opposite of good,--of God
 and His creation; a curse; a belief in intelligent matter,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_580"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 580</font></a></p><p></p><p>finiteness, and mortality; "dust to dust;" red sandstone; nothingness; the first god of mythology; not
 God's man, who represents the one God and is His own
 image and likeness; the opposite of Spirit and His creations; that which is not the image and likeness of good,
 but a material belief, opposed to the one Mind, or Spirit;
 a so-called finite mind, producing other minds, thus making "gods many and lords many" (I Corinthians viii. 5);
 a product of nothing as the mimicry of something; an
 unreality as opposed to the great reality of spiritual existence and creation; a so-called man, whose origin,
 substance, and mind are found to be the antipode of
 God, or Spirit; an inverted image of Spirit; the image
 and likeness of what God has not created, namely, matter, sin, sickness, and death; the opposer of Truth,
 termed error;  Life's counterfeit, which ultimates in
 death; the opposite of Love, called hate; the usurper
 of Spirit's creation, called self-creative matter; immortality's opposite, mortality; that of which wisdom saith,
 "Thou shalt surely die."
 </p><p></p><p>The name Adam represents the false supposition that
 Life is not eternal, but has beginning and end; that the
 infinite enters the finite, that intelligence passes into nonintelligence, and that Soul dwells in material sense; that
 immortal Mind results in matter, and matter in mortal
 mind; that the one God and creator entered what He created, and then disappeared in the atheism of matter.
 </p><p></p><p>ADVERSARY. An adversary is one who opposes, denies,
 disputes, not one who constructs and sustains reality and
 Truth. Jesus said of the devil, "He was a murderer from
 the beginning, . . . he is a liar and the father of it."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_581"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 581</font></a></p><p></p><p>This view of Satan is confirmed by the name often conferred upon him in Scripture, the "adversary."
 </p><p></p><p>ALMIGHTY. All-power; infinity; omnipotence.    
 </p><p></p><p>ANGELS. God's thoughts passing to man;  spiritual
 intuitions, pure and perfect; the inspiration of goodness,
 purity, and immortality, counteracting all evil, sensuality, 
 and mortality.
 </p><p></p><p>ARK. Safety; the idea, or reflection, of Truth, proved
 to be as immortal as its Principle; the understanding of 
 Spirit, destroying belief in matter.
 </p><p></p><p>God and man coexistent and eternal; Science showing that the spiritual realities of all things are created 
 by Him and exist forever. The ark indicates temptation
 overcome and followed by exaltation.
 </p><p></p><p>ASHER (Jacob's son). Hope and faith; spiritual compensation; the ills of the flesh rebuked.
 </p><p></p><p>BABEL. Self-destroying error; a kingdom divided
 against itself, which cannot stand; material knowledge. 
 </p><p>The higher false knowledge builds on the basis of evidence obtained from the five corporeal senses, the more
 confusion ensues, and the more certain is the downfall 
 of its structure.
 </p><p></p><p>BAPTISM. Purification by Spirit; submergence in
 Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p>We are "willing rather to be absent from the body,
 and to be present with the Lord." (II Corinthians v. 8.)
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_582"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 582</font></a></p><p></p><p>BELIEVING. Firmness and constancy; not a faltering
 nor a blind faith, but the perception of spiritual Truth.
 Mortal thoughts, illusion.
 </p><p></p><p>BENJAMIN (Jacob's son). A physical belief as to life,
 substance, and mind; human knowledge, or so-called
 mortal mind, devoted to matter; pride; envy; fame;
 illusion; a false belief; error masquerading as the possessor of life, strength, animation, and power to act.
 </p><p></p><p>Renewal of affections; self-offering; an improved
 state of mortal mind; the introduction of a more spiritual
 origin; a gleam of the infinite idea of the infinite Principle; a spiritual type; that which comforts, consoles,
 and supports.
 </p><p></p><p>BRIDE. Purity and innocence, conceiving man in the
 idea of God; a sense of Soul, which has spiritual bliss
 and enjoys but cannot suffer.
 </p><p></p><p>BRIDEGROOM. Spiritual understanding; the pure consciousness that God, the divine Principle, creates man
 as His own spiritual idea, and that God is the only creative power.
 </p><p></p><p>BURIAL. Corporeality and physical sense put out of
 sight and hearing; annihilation. Submergence in Spirit;
 immortality brought to light.
 </p><p></p><p>CANAAN (the son of Ham). A sensuous belief; the
 testimony of what is termed material sense; the error
 which would make man mortal and would make mortal
 mind a slave to the body.
 </p><p></p><p>CHILDREN. The spiritual thoughts and representatives of Life, Truth, and Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_583"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 583</font></a></p><p></p><p>Sensual and mortal beliefs; counterfeits of creation, 
 whose better originals are God's thoughts, not in embryo, but in maturity; material suppositions of life, substance, and intelligence, opposed to the Science of being.
 </p><p></p><p>CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The representatives of Soul, not
 corporeal sense; the offspring of Spirit, who, having 
 wrestled with error, sin, and sense, are governed by divine
 Science; some of the ideas of God beheld as men, casting
 out error and healing the sick; Christ's offspring.   
 </p><p></p><p>CHRIST. The divine manifestation of God, which comes
 to the flesh to destroy incarnate error.
 </p><p></p><p>CHURCH. The structure of Truth and Love; whatever rests upon and proceeds from divine Principle.
 </p><p></p><p>The Church is that institution, which affords proof of
 its utility and is found elevating the race, rousing the 
 dormant understanding from material beliefs to the apprehension of spiritual ideas and the demonstration of
 divine Science, thereby casting out devils, or error, and 
 healing the sick.
 </p><p></p><p>CREATOR. Spirit; Mind; intelligence; the animating
 divine Principle of all that is real and good; self-existent 
 Life, Truth, and Love; that which is perfect and eternal;
 the opposite of matter and evil, which have no Principle; God, who made all that was made and could not 
 create an atom or an element the opposite of Himself.
 </p><p></p><p>DAN (Jacob's son). Animal magnetism; so-called mortal mind controlling mortal mind; error, working out 
 the designs of error; one belief preying upon another.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_584%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 584 </font></a></p><p></p><p>DAY. The irradiance of Life; light, the spiritual idea
 of Truth and Love.
 </p><p></p><p>"And the evening and the morning were the first day."
 (Genesis i. 5.) The objects of time and sense disappear
 in the illumination of spiritual understanding, and Mind
 measures time according to the good that is unfolded.
 This unfolding is God's day, and "there shall be no night
 there."
 </p><p></p><p>DEATH. An illusion, the lie of life in matter; the unreal and untrue; the opposite of Life.
 </p><p></p><p>Matter has no life, hence it has no real existence. Mind
 is immortal. The flesh, warring against Spirit; that
 which frets itself free from one belief only to be fettered 
 by another, until every belief of life where Life is not
 yields to eternal Life. Any material evidence of death is
 false, for it contradicts the spiritual facts of being.
 </p><p></p><p>DEVIL. Evil; a lie; error; neither corporeality nor
 mind; the opposite of Truth; a belief in sin, sickness,
 and death; animal magnetism or hypnotism; the lust of
 the flesh, which saith: " I am life and intelligence in
 matter. There is more than one mind, for I am mind, a wicked mind, self-made or created by a tribal god and
 put into the opposite of mind, termed matter, thence to
 reproduce a mortal universe, including man, not after the
 image and likeness of Spirit, but after its own image."
 </p><p></p><p>DOVE. A symbol of divine Science; purity and peace;
 hope and faith.
 </p><p></p><p>DUST. Nothingness; the absence of substance, life, or
 intelligence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_585"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 585</font></a></p><p></p><p>EARS. Not organs of the so-called corporeal senses, 
 but spiritual understanding.
 </p><p></p><p>Jesus said, referring to spiritual perception, "Having 
 ears, hear ye not?" (Mark viii. 18.)
 </p><p></p><p>EARTH. A sphere; a type of eternity and immortality,
 which are likewise without beginning or end.    
 </p><p></p><p>To material sense, earth is matter; to spiritual sense,
 it is a compound idea.
 </p><p></p><p>ELIAS. Prophecy; spiritual evidence opposed to material sense; Christian Science, with which can be discerned
 the spiritual fact of whatever the material senses behold;
 the basis of immortality. 
 </p><p></p><p>"Elias truly shall first come and restore all things."
 (Matthew xvii. 11.)

 </p><p></p><p>EUPHRATES (river). Divine Science encompassing
 the universe and man; the true idea of God; a type
 of the glory which is to come; metaphysics taking the 
 place of physics; the reign of righteousness. The atmosphere of human belief before it accepts sin, sickness, or
 death; a state of mortal thought, the only error of which 
 is limitation; finity; the opposite of infinity.
 </p><p></p><p>EVE. A beginning; mortality; that which does not
 last forever; a finite belief concerning life, substance, 
 and intelligence in matter; error; the belief that the human race originated materially instead of spiritually, that man started first from dust, second from a rib, and 
 third from an egg.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_586"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 586</font></a></p><p></p><p>EVENING. Mistiness of mortal thought; weariness of
 mortal mind; obscured views; peace and rest.
 </p><p></p><p>EYES. Spiritual discernment,--not material but
 mental.
 </p><p></p><p>Jesus said, thinking of the outward vision, "Having
 eyes, see ye not?" (Mark viii. 18.)
 </p><p></p><p>FAN. Separator of fable from fact; that which gives
 action to thought.
 </p><p></p><p>FATHER. Eternal Life; the one Mind; the divine
 Principle, commonly called God.
 </p><p></p><p>FEAR. Heat; inflammation; anxiety; ignorance; error;
 desire; caution.
 </p><p></p><p>FIRE. Fear; remorse; lust; hatred; destruction; affliction purifying and elevating man.

 Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love; all substance;
 intelligence.
 </p><p></p><p>GODS. Mythology; a belief that life, substance, and 
 intelligence are both mental and material; a supposition
 of sentient physicality; the belief that infinite Mind is in
 finite forms; the various theories that hold mind to be a 
 material sense, existing in brain, nerve, matter; supposititious minds, or souls, going in and out of matter, erring
 and mortal; the serpents of error, which say, "Ye shall 
 be as gods."

 </p><p></p><p>There is but one I, or Us, but one divine Principle, or
 Mind, governing all existence; man and woman unchanged forever in their individual characters, even as
 numbers which never blend with each other, though they
 are governed by one Principle. All the objects of God's

 life, substance, and intelligence are both mental and
 material.
 </p><p></p><p>I AM. God; incorporeal and eternal Mind; divine

 </p><p></p><p>IN. A term obsolete in Science if used with reference

 rebuking mortal belief, or error, and showing the immortality and supremacy of Truth; pure affection blessing 
 its enemies.
 </p><p></p><p>JUDAH. A corporeal material belief progressing and
 disappearing; the spiritual understanding of God and

 </p><p></p><p>LIFE. See chapter on Recapitulation, page 468.
 </p><p></p><p>LORD. In the Hebrew, this term is sometimes employed as a title, which has the inferior sense of master,
 or ruler. In the Greek, the word kurios almost always
 has this lower sense, unless specially coupled with the
 name God. Its higher signification is Supreme Ruler.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">LORD GOD. Jehovah.</font></p>
 <p>This double term is not used in the first chapter of
 Genesis, the record of spiritual creation.  It is introduced in the second and following chapters, when the
 spiritual sense of God and of infinity is disappearing
 from the recorder's thought,--when the true scientific
 statements of the Scriptures become clouded through a
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_591"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 591</font></a></p><p></p><p>physical sense of God as finite and corporeal. From this

 Mind takes no cognizance; that which mortal mind sees,
 feels, hears, tastes, and smells only in belief.   
 </p><p></p><p>MIND. The only I, or Us; the only Spirit, Soul, divine
 Principle, substance, Life, Truth, Love; the one God;
 not that which is in man, but the divine Principle, or God, 
 of whom man is the full and perfect expression; Deity,
 which outlines but is not outlined.
 </p><p></p><p>MIRACLE. That which is divinely natural, but must 
 be learned humanly; a phenomenon of Science.
 </p><p></p><p>MORNING. Light; symbol of Truth; revelation and
 progress.     
 </p><p></p><p>MORTAL MIND. Nothing claiming to be something,
 for Mind is immortal; mythology; error creating other
 errors; a suppositional material sense, alias the belief 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_592"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 592</font></a></p><p></p><p>that sensation is in matter, which is sensationless; a belief that life, substance, and intelligence are in and of
 matter; the opposite of Spirit, and therefore the opposite
 of God, or good; the belief that life has a beginning

 Truth, and Love.

 and harmony of the universe; the kingdom of heaven,

 </p><p></p><p>PHARISEE. Corporeal and sensuous belief; self-righteousness; vanity; hypocrisy.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_593"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 593</font></a></p><p></p><p>PISON (river). The love of the good and beautiful, and

 stubbornness.
 </p><p></p><p>SALVATION. Life, Truth, and Love understood and
 demonstrated as supreme over all; sin, sickness, and

 the first statement of mythology and idolatry; the belief
 in more than one God; animal magnetism; the first lie
 of limitation; finity; the first claim that there is an opposite of Spirit, or good, termed matter, or evil; the first
 delusion that error exists as fact; the first claim that sin,
 sickness, and death are the realities of life. The first
 audible claim that God was not omnipotent and that
 there was another power, named evil, which was as real
 and eternal as God, good.
 </p><p></p><p>SHEEP. Innocence; inoffensiveness; those who follow
 their leader.

 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_595"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 595</font></a></p><p></p><p>SUN. The symbol of Soul governing man,--of 
 Truth, Life, and Love.
 </p><p></p><p>SWORD. The idea of Truth; justice.   Revenge;  
 anger.
 </p><p></p><p>TARES. Mortality; error; sin; sickness; disease;
 death.    
 </p><p></p><p>TEMPLE. Body; the idea of Life, substance, and intelligence; the superstructure of Truth; the shrine of
 Love; a material superstructure, where mortals congregate for worship.
 </p><p></p><p>THUMMIM. Perfection; the eternal demand of divine
 Science.   
 </p><p></p><p>The Urim and Thummim, which were to be on Aaron's
 breast when he went before Jehovah, were holiness and
 purification of thought and deed, which alone can fit us 
 for the office of spiritual teaching.
 </p><p></p><p>TIME. Mortal measurements; limits, in which are
 summed up all human acts, thoughts, beliefs, opinions, 
 knowledge; matter; error; that which begins before,
 and continues after, what is termed death, until the mortal

 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_596"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 596</font></a></p><p></p><p>UNKNOWN. That which spiritual sense alone comprehends, and which is unknown to the material senses.
 </p><p></p><p>Paganism and agnosticism may define Deity as "the
 great unknowable;" but Christian Science brings God
 much nearer to man, and makes Him better known as
 the All-in-all, forever near.
 </p><p></p><p>Paul saw in Athens an altar dedicated "to the unknown
 God." Referring to it, he said to the Athenians: "Whom
 therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you."
 (Acts xvii. 23.)
 </p><p></p><p>URIM. Light.
 </p><p></p><p>The rabbins believed that the stones in the breastplate of the high-priest had supernatural illumination,
 but Christian Science reveals Spirit, not matter, as the
 illuminator of all. The illuminations of Science give us
 a sense of the nothingness of error, and they show the
 spiritual inspiration of Love and Truth to be the only fit
 preparation for admission to the presence and power of
 the Most High.
 </p><p></p><p>VALLEY. Depression; meekness; darkness.
 </p><p></p><p>"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
 death, I will fear no evil." (Psalm xxiii. 4.)
 </p><p></p><p>Though the way is dark in mortal sense, divine Life
 and Love illumine it, destroy the unrest of mortal thought,
 the fear of death, and the supposed reality of error. Christian Science, contradicting sense, maketh the valley to bud
 and blossom as the rose.
 </p><p></p><p>VEIL. A cover; concealment; hiding; hypocrisy.
 The Jewish women wore veils over their faces in token

 Pharisaical notions.
 </p><p></p><p>The Judaic religion consisted mostly of rites and ceremonies. The motives and affections of a man were of
 little value, if only he appeared unto men to fast. The
 great Nazarene, as meek as he was mighty, rebuked the 
 hypocrisy, which offered long petitions for blessings upon
 material methods, but cloaked the crime, latent in thought,
 which was ready to spring into action and crucify God's 
 anointed. The martyrdom of Jesus was the culminating
 sin of Pharisaism. It rent the veil of the temple. It revealed the false foundations and superstructures of superficial religion, tore from bigotry and superstition their
 coverings, and opened the sepulchre with divine Science,
 - immortality and Love.  
 </p><p></p><p>WILDERNESS. Loneliness; doubt; darkness. Spontaneity of thought and idea; the vestibule in which a
 material sense of things disappears, and spiritual sense 
 unfolds the great facts of existence.
 </p><p></p><p>WILL. The motive-power of error; mortal belief; animal power. The might and wisdom of God.  
 </p><p></p><p>"For this is the will of God." (I Thessalonians
 iv. 3.)
 </p><p></p><p>Will, as a quality of so-called mortal mind, is a wrongdoer; hence it should not be confounded with the term
 as applied to Mind or to one of God's qualities.
 </p><p></p><p>WIND. That which indicates the might of omnipotence and the movements of God's spiritual government,
 encompassing all things. Destruction; anger; mortal
 passions.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_598"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 598</font></a></p><p></p><p>The Greek word for wind (pneuma) is used also for
 spirit, as in the passage in John's Gospel, the third chapter, where we read: "The wind [pneuma] bloweth where
 it listeth. . . . So is every one that is born of the Spirit
 [pneuma]." Here the original word is the same in both
 cases, yet it has received different translations, as in other
 passages in this same chapter and elsewhere in the New
 Testament. This shows how our Master had constantly
 to employ words of material significance in order to unfold
 spiritual thoughts. In the record of Jesus' supposed
 death, we read: "He bowed his head, and gave up the
 ghost;" but this word ghost is pneuma. It might be translated wind or air, and the phrase is equivalent to our
 common statement, "He breathed his last."   What
 Jesus gave up was indeed air, an etherealized form of
 matter, for never did he give up Spirit, or Soul.
 </p><p></p><p>WINE. Inspiration; understanding. Error; fornication; temptation; passion.
 </p><p></p><p>YEAR. A solar measurement of time; mortality;
 space for repentance.
 </p><p></p><p>"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years."
 (II Peter iii. 8.)
 </p><p></p><p>One moment of divine consciousness, or the spiritual
 understanding of Life and Love, is a foretaste of eternity.
 This exalted view, obtained and retained when the Science of being is understood, would bridge over with life
 discerned spiritually the interval of death, and man
 would be in the full consciousness of his immortality and
 eternal harmony, where sin, sickness, and death are unknown. Time is a mortal thought, the divisor of which
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_599"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 599</font></a></p><p></p><p>is the solar year. Eternity is God's measurement of Soulfilled years.
 </p><p></p><p>YOU. As applied to corporeality, a mortal; finity. 
 </p><p></p><p>ZEAL. The reflected animation of Life, Truth, and
 Love. Blind enthusiasm; mortal will.
 </p><p></p><p>ZION. Spiritual foundation and superstructure; inspiration; spiritual strength. Emptiness; unfaithfulness; desolation.
