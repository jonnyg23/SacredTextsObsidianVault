 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter VIII - Footsteps of Truth</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a></p><p></p><p>Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants; how I do bear in my
 bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of Thine anointed.--PSALMS.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Practical preaching</font></p>
 THE best sermon ever preached is Truth practised
 and demonstrated by the destruction of sin, sickness,
 and death. Knowing this and knowing too 
 that one affection would be supreme in us and 
 take the lead in our lives, Jesus said, "No man can serve
 two masters."  
 <p></p><p>We cannot build safely on false foundations. Truth
 makes a new creature, in whom old things pass away
 and "all things are become new." Passions, selfishness, 
 false appetites, hatred, fear, all sensuality, yield to spirituality, and the superabundance of being is on the side
 of God, good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The uses of truth</font></p>
 We cannot fill vessels already full. They must first be
 emptied. Let us disrobe error. Then, when
 the winds of God blow, we shall not hug our 
 tatters close about us.
 <p></p><p>The way to extract error from mortal mind is to pour
 in truth through flood-tides of Love. Christian perfection is won on no other basis.
 </p><p></p><p>Grafting holiness upon unholiness, supposing that sin
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_202%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202 </font></a></p><p></p><p>can be forgiven when it is not forsaken, is as foolish as
 straining out gnats and swallowing camels.
 </p><p></p><p>The scientific unity which exists between God and man
 must be wrought out in life-practice, and God's will must
 be universally done.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine study</font></p>
 If men would bring to bear upon the study of the
 Science of Mind half the faith they bestow upon the socalled pains and pleasures of material sense,
 they would not go on from bad to worse,
 until disciplined by the prison and the scaffold; but
 the whole human family would be redeemed through
 the merits of Christ, - through the perception and acceptance of Truth. For this glorious result Christian
 Science lights the torch of spiritual understanding.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Harmonious life-work</font></p>
 Outside of this Science all is mutable; but immortal
 man, in accord with the divine Principle of His being,
 God, neither sins, suffers, nor dies. The days
 of our pilgrimage will multiply instead of diminish, when God's kingdom comes on earth; for the
 true way leads to life instead of to death, and earthly
 experience discloses the finity of error and the infinite
 capacities of Truth, in which God gives  man  dominion
 over all the earth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief and practice</font></p>
 Our beliefs about  a  Supreme  Being  contradict  the
 practice growing out of them.    Error  abounds  where
 Truth  should  "much  more  abound."  We
 admit that God has almighty power, is "a
 very present help in trouble;" and yet we rely on a drug
 or hypnotism to heal disease, as if senseless matter or erring mortal mind had more power than omnipotent Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sure reward of righteousness</font></p>
 Common opinion admits that a man may take cold in
 the act of doing good, and that this cold may produce
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p><p></p><p>fatal pulmonary disease; as though evil could overbear 
 the law of Love, and check the reward for doing good. In the Science of Christianity, Mind 
 - omnipotence--has all-power, assigns sure 
 rewards to righteousness, and shows that matter can
 neither heal nor make sick, create nor destroy. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our belief and understanding</font></p>
 If God were understood instead of being merely believed, this understanding would establish health. The
 accusation of the rabbis, "He made himself 
 the Son of God," was really the justification 
 of Jesus, for to the Christian the only true 
 spirit is Godlike. This thought incites to a more exalted 
 worship and self-abnegation. Spiritual perception brings
 out the possibilities of being, destroys reliance on aught
 but God, and so makes man the image of his Maker in
 deed and in truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Suicide and sin</font></p>
 We are prone to believe either in more than one Supreme Ruler or in some power less than God. We imagine that Mind can be imprisoned in a sensuous body.
 When the material body has gone to ruin, when evil has
 overtaxed the belief of life in matter and destroyed it,
 then mortals believe that the deathless Principle, or
 Soul, escapes from matter and lives on; but this is not
 true. Death is not a stepping-stone to life, immortality,
 and bliss. The so-called sinner is a suicide. 
 Sin kills the sinner and will continue to kill
 him so long as he sins. The foam and fury of illegitimate living and of fearful and doleful dying should
 disappear on the shore of time; then the waves of sin,
 sorrow, and death beat in vain.    
     
 God, divine good, does not kill a man in order to give
 him eternal Life, for God alone is man's life. God is at
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p><p></p><p>once the centre and circumference of being. It is evil
 that dies; good dies not.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit the only intelligence and substance</font></p>
 All forms of error support the false conclusions that
 there is more than one Life; that material history is as
 real and living as spiritual history; that mortal
 error is as conclusively mental as immortal
 Truth; and that there are two separate, antagonistic entities  and  beings,  two  powers,--namely,
 Spirit and matter,--resulting in a third person (mortal
 man) who  carries out the delusions of sin, sickness, and
 death.
 <p></p><p>The first power is admitted to be good, an intelligence or
 Mind called God. The so-called second power, evil, is the
 unlikeness of good. It cannot therefore be mind, though
 so called. The third power, mortal man, is a supposed
 mixture of the first and second antagonistic powers, intelligence and non-intelligence, of Spirit and matter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unscientific theories</font></p>
 Such theories are evidently erroneous. They can never
 stand the test of Science.  Judging them by their fruits,
 they are corrupt. When will the ages understand the Ego, and realize only one God, one
 Mind or intelligence?
 <p></p><p>False and self-assertive theories have given sinners the
 notion that they can create what God cannot,--namely,
 sinful mortals in God's image, thus usurping the name
 without the nature of the image or reflection of divine
 Mind; but in Science it can never be said that man
 has a mind of his own, distinct from God, the all
 Mind.
 </p><p></p><p>The belief that God lives in matter is pantheistic. The
 error, which says that Soul is in body, Mind is in matter,
 and good is in evil, must unsay it and cease from such
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p> 
 utterances; else God will continue to be hidden from humanity, and mortals will sin without knowing that they
 are sinning, will lean on matter instead of Spirit, stumble 
 with lameness, drop with drunkenness, consume with discase,--all because of their blindness, their false sense
 concerning God and man.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Creation perfect    </font></p>
 When will the error of believing that there is life in
 matter, and that sin, sickness, and death are creations of
 God, be unmasked? When will it be understood that matter has neither intelligence, life, 
 nor sensation, and that the opposite belief is the prolific
 source of all suffering? God created all through Mind, 
 and made all perfect and eternal.  Where then is the
 necessity for recreation or procreation?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perceiving the divine image</font></p>
 Befogged in error (the error of believing that matter 
 can be intelligent for good or evil), we can catch clear
 glimpses of God only as the mists disperse, 
 or as they melt into such thinness that we perceive the divine image in some word or deed
 which indicates the true idea, - the supremacy and reality of good, the nothingness and unreality of evil.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Redemption from selfishness</font></p>
 When we realize that there is one Mind, the divine law
 of loving our neighbor as ourselves is unfolded; 
 whereas a belief in many ruling minds hinders
 man's normal drift towards the one Mind, one 
 God, and leads human thought into opposite channels
 where selfishness reigns.   
       
 Selfishness tips the beam of human existence towards
 the side of error, not towards Truth. Denial of the oneness of Mind throws our weight into the scale, not of 
 Spirit, God, good, but of matter.
 <p></p><p>When we fully understand our relation to the Divine,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p><p>we can have no other Mind but His,--no other Love,
 wisdom, or Truth, no other sense of Life, and no consciousness of the existence of matter or error.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Will-power unrighteous</font></p>
 The power of the human will should be exercised only
 in subordination to Truth; else it will misguide the judgment and free the lower propensities. It is the
 province of spiritual sense to govern  man.
 Material, erring, human thought acts injuriously both
 upon the body and through it.
 <p></p><p>Will-power is capable of all evil. It can never  heal
 the sick, for it is the prayer of the unrighteous; while
 the exercise of the sentiments--hope, faith, love--is the
 prayer of the righteous. This prayer, governed by Science
 instead of the senses, heals the sick.
 </p><p></p><p>In the scientific relation of God to man, we find that
 whatever blesses one blesses all, as Jesus showed with
 the loaves and the fishes,--Spirit, not matter, being the
 source of supply.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Birth and death unreal</font></p>
 Does God send sickness, giving the mother her child
 for the brief space of a few years and then taking it away
 by death? Is God creating anew what He
 has already created? The Scriptures are definite on this point, declaring that His work was finished,
 nothing is new to God, and that it was good.
 <p></p><p>Can there be any birth or death for man, the spiritual
 image and likeness of God?  Instead of God sending
 sickness and death, He destroys them, and brings to light
 immortality. Omnipotent and  infinite Mind made all
 and includes all. This Mind does not make mistakes
 and subsequently correct them. God does not cause man
 to sin, to be sick, or to die.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No evil in Spirit</font></p>
 There are evil beliefs, often called evil spirits; but
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_207%20%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207  </font></a></p><p></p><p>these evils are not Spirit, for there is no evil in Spirit. 
 Because God is Spirit, evil becomes more apparent and
 obnoxious proportionately as we advance spiritually, until it disappears from our lives. 
 This fact proves our position, for every scientific statement
  in Christianity has its proof. Error of statement 
 leads to error in action.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Subordination of evil</font></p>
 God is not the creator of an evil mind. Indeed, evil
 is not Mind. We must learn that evil is the awful deception and unreality of existence. Evil is not 
 supreme; good is not helpless; nor are the  
 so-called laws of matter primary, and the law of Spirit 
 secondary. Without this lesson, we lose sight of the perfect Father, or the divine Principle of man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evident impossibilities</font></p>
 Body is not first and Soul last, nor is evil mightier than 
 good. The Science of being repudiates selfevident impossibilities, such as the amalgamation of Truth and error in cause or effect. Science separates the tares and wheat in time of harvest.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One primal cause</font></p>
 There is but one primal cause. Therefore there can
 be no effect from any other cause, and there can be no 
 reality in aught which does not proceed from 
 this great and only cause. Sin, sickness, disease, and death belong not to the Science of being. They 
 are the errors, which presuppose the absence of Truth,
 Life, or Love.
 <p></p><p>The spiritual reality is the scientific fact in all things. 
 The spiritual fact, repeated in the action of man and the
 whole universe, is harmonious and is the ideal of Truth.
 Spiritual facts are not inverted; the opposite discord, 
 which bears no resemblance to spirituality, is not real.
 The only evidence of this inversion is obtained from
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_208%20%20%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208   </font></a></p><p></p><p>suppositional error, which affords no proof of God,
 Spirit, or of the spiritual creation. Material sense defines all things materially, and has a finite sense of the
 infinite.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Seemingly independent authority</font></p>
 The Scriptures say, "In Him we live, and move, and
 have our being." What then is this seeming power, independent of God, which causes disease and
 cures it? What is it but an error of belief, a law of mortal mind, wrong in every sense,
 embracing sin, sickness, and death? It is the very antipode of immortal Mind, of Truth, and of spiritual law.
 It is not in accordance with the goodness of God's character that He should make man sick, then leave man to
 heal himself; it is absurd to suppose that matter can both
 cause and cure disease, or that Spirit, God, produces
 disease and leaves the remedy to matter.
 <p></p><p>John Young of Edinburgh writes: "God is the father
 of mind, and of nothing else." Such an utterance is
 "the voice of one crying in the wilderness" of human
 beliefs and preparing the way of Science. Let us learn
 of the real and eternal, and prepare for the reign of
 Spirit, the kingdom of heaven,--the reign and rule of
 universal harmony, which cannot be lost nor remain
 forever unseen.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness as only thought</font></p>
 Mind, not matter, is causation.  A material body
 only expresses a material and mortal mind. A mortal
 man possesses this body, and he makes it
 harmonious or discordant according to the
 images of thought impressed upon  it. You embrace
 your body in your thought, and you should delineate
 upon it thoughts of health, not of sickness. You should
 banish all thoughts of disease and sin and of other beliefs
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p><p></p><p>included in matter. Man, being immortal, has a perfect 
 indestructible life. It is the mortal belief which makes
 the body discordant and diseased in proportion as ignorance, fear, or human will governs mortals.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Allness of Truth</font></p>
 Mind, supreme over all its formations and governing
 them all, is the central sun of its own systems of ideas, 
 the life and light of all its own vast creation;
 and man is tributary to divine Mind. The
 material and mortal body or mind is not the man. 
   
 The world would collapse without Mind, without the intelligence which holds the winds in its grasp. Neither
 philosophy nor skepticism can hinder the march of the 
 Science which reveals the supremacy of Mind. The immanent sense of Mind-power enhances the glory of Mind.
 Nearness, not distance, lends enchantment to this view.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual translation</font></p>
 The compounded minerals or aggregated substances
 composing the earth, the relations which constituent
 masses hold to each other, the magnitudes, 
 distances, and revolutions of the celestial 
 bodies, are of no real importance, when we remember
 that they all must give place to the spiritual fact by the 
 translation of man and the universe back into Spirit. In
 proportion as this is done, man and the universe will be
 found harmonious and eternal.     
   
 Material substances or mundane formations, astronomical calculations, and all the paraphernalia of speculative theories, based on the hypothesis of material law 
 or life and intelligence resident in matter, will ultimately vanish, swallowed up in the infinite calculus of
 Spirit.
 <p></p><p>Spiritual sense is a conscious, constant capacity to understand God. It shows the superiority of faith by works
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_210%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210 </font></a></p><p></p><p>over faith in words. Its ideas are expressed only in "new
 tongues;" and these are interpreted by the translation of
 the spiritual original into the language which human
 thought can comprehend.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus' disregard of matter</font></p>
 The Principle and proof of Christianity are discerned
 by spiritual sense. They are set forth in Jesus' demonstrations, which show--by his healing the
 sick, casting out evils, and destroying death,
 "the last enemy that shall be destroyed," his disregard of matter and its so-called laws.
 <p></p><p>Knowing that Soul and its attributes were forever
 manifested through man, the Master healed the sick,
 gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, feet to the
 lame, thus bringing to light the scientific action of the
 divine Mind on human minds and bodies and giving
 a better understanding of Soul and salvation. Jesus
 healed sickness and sin by one and the same metaphysical
 process.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind not mortal</font></p>
 The expression mortal mind is really a solecism, for
 Mind is immortal, and Truth pierces the error of mortality
 as a sunbeam penetrates the cloud. Because,
 in obedience to the immutable law of Spirit,
 this so-called mind is self-destructive, I name it mortal.
 Error soweth the wind and reapeth the whirlwind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter mindless</font></p>
 What is termed matter, being unintelligent, cannot say,
 "I suffer, I die, I am sick, or I am well." It is the socalled mortal mind which voices this and appears to itself to make good its claim. To
 mortal sense, sin and suffering are real, but immortal
 sense includes no evil nor pestilence. Because immortal
 sense has no error of sense, it has no sense of error; there
 fore it is without a destructive element.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p><p></p><p>If brain, nerves, stomach, are intelligent,--if they talk 
 to us, tell us their condition, and report how they feel, then Spirit and matter, Truth and error, commingle 
 and produce sickness and health, good and evil, life and
 death; and who shall say whether Truth or error is the
 greater?    
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter sensationless   </font></p>
 The sensations of the body must either be the sensations of a so-called mortal mind or of matter. Nerves
 are not mind. Is it not provable that Mind is 
 not mortal and that matter has no sensation?  
 Is it not equally true that matter does not appear in the
 spiritual understanding of being?   
      
 The sensation of sickness and the impulse to sin seem
 to obtain in mortal mind. When a tear starts, does not
 this so-called mind produce the effect seen in the lachrymal gland? Without mortal mind, the tear could not
 appear; and this action shows the nature of all so-called
 material cause and effect.   
       
 It should no longer be said in Israel that "the fathers
 have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set
 on edge." Sympathy with error should disappear. The 
 transfer of the thoughts of one erring mind to another,
 Science renders impossible.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Nerves painless</font></p>
 If it is true that nerves have sensation, that matter has 
 intelligence, that the material organism causes the eyes to
 see and the ears to hear, then, when the body 
 is dematerialized, these faculties must be lost,  
 for their immortality is not in Spirit; whereas the fact
 is that only through dematerialization and spiritualization of thought can these faculties be conceived of as 
 immortal.
 <p></p><p>Nerves are not the source of pain or pleasure. We
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_212%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212 </font></a></p><p>suffer or enjoy in our dreams, but this pain or pleasure
 is not communicated through a nerve. A tooth which has
 been extracted sometimes aches again in belief, and the
 pain seems to be in its old place. A limb which has been
 amputated has continued in belief to pain the owner. If
 the sensation of pain in the limb can return, can be prolonged, why cannot the limb reappear?
 </p><p></p><p>Why need pain, rather than pleasure, come to this mortal sense? Because the memory of pain is more vivid
 than the memory of pleasure. I have seen an unwitting
 attempt to scratch the end of a finger which had been cut
 off for months. When the nerve is gone, which we say
 was the occasion of pain, and the pain still remains, it
 proves sensation to be in the mortal mind, not in matter.
 Reverse the process; take away this so-called mind instead
 of a piece of the flesh, and the nerves have no sensation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human falsities</font></p>
 Mortals have a modus of their own, undirected and unsustained by God. They produce a rose through seed and
 soil, and bring the rose into contact with the
 olfactory nerves that they may smell it.  In
 legerdemain and credulous frenzy, mortals believe that
 unseen spirits produce the flowers. God alone makes
 and clothes the lilies of the field, and this He does by
 means of Mind, not matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No miracles in Mind-methods</font></p>
 Because all the methods of Mind are not understood,
 we say the lips or hands must move in order to convey
 thought, that the undulations of the air convey
 sound, and possibly that other methods involve
 so-called miracles. The realities of being, its
 normal action, and the origin of all things are unseen to
 mortal sense; whereas the unreal and imitative movements of mortal belief, which would reverse the immortal
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p><p></p><p>modus and action, are styled the real. Whoever contradicts this mortal mind supposition of reality is called
 a deceiver, or is said to be deceived. Of a man it has 
 been said, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he;" hence
 as a man spiritually understandeth, so is he in truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Good indefinable</font></p>
 Mortal mind conceives of something as either liquid 
 or solid, and then classifies it materially. Immortal and
 spiritual facts exist apart from this mortal and
 material conception. God, good, is self-existent and self-expressed, though indefinable as a whole.
 Every step towards goodness is a departure from materiality, and is a tendency towards God, Spirit. Material 
 theories partially paralyze this attraction towards infinite
 and eternal good by an opposite attraction towards the
 finite, temporary, and discordant.    
    
 Sound is a mental impression made on mortal belief.
 The ear does not really hear. Divine Science reveals
 sound as communicated through the senses of Soul through spiritual understanding.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Music, rhythm of head and heart</font></p>
 Mozart experienced more than he expressed. The
 rapture of his grandest symphonies was never heard. He 
 was a musician beyond what the world knew.  
 This was even more strikingly true of Beet-  
 hoven, who was so long hopelessly deaf. Mental melodies and strains of sweetest music supersede conscious sound. Music is the rhythm of head and heart.
 Mortal mind is the harp of many strings, discoursing 
 either discord or harmony according as the hand, which
 sweeps over it, is human or divine.
 <p></p><p>Before human knowledge dipped to its depths into a 
 false sense of things,--into belief in material origins
 which discard the one Mind and true source of being, </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_214%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214 </font></a></p><p></p><p>it is possible that the impressions from Truth were as
 distinct as sound, and that they came as sound to the
 primitive prophets. If the medium of hearing is wholly
 spiritual, it is normal and indestructible.
 </p><p></p><p>If Enoch's perception had been confined to the evidence
 before his material senses, he could never have "walked
 with God," nor been guided into the demonstration of
 life eternal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Adam and the senses</font></p>
 Adam, represented in the Scriptures as formed from
 dust, is an object-lesson for the human mind. The material senses, like Adam, originate in matter and
 return to dust,--are proved non-intelligent.
 They go out as they came in, for they are still the error,
 not the truth of being. When it is learned that the spiritual sense, and not the material, conveys the impressions
 of Mind to man, then being will be understood and found
 to be harmonious.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Idolatrous illusions</font></p>
 We bow down to matter, and entertain finite thoughts
 of God like the pagan idolater. Mortals are inclined to
 fear and to obey what they consider a material
 body more than they do a spiritual God. All
 material knowledge, like the original "tree of knowledge,"
 multiplies their pains, for mortal illusions would rob God,
 slay man, and meanwhile would spread their table with
 cannibal tidbits and give thanks.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The senses of Soul</font></p>
 How transient a sense is mortal sight, when a wound on
 the retina may end the power of light and lens! But the
 real sight or sense is not lost. Neither age nor
 accident can interfere with the senses of Soul,
 and there are no other real senses. It is evident that the
 body as matter has no sensation of its own, and there is no
 oblivion for Soul and its faculties. Spirit's senses are with<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p><p></p><p>out pain, and they are forever at peace. Nothing can hide 
 from them the harmony of all things and the might and
 permanence of Truth.  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Real being never lost        </font></p>
 If Spirit, Soul, could sin or be lost, then being and immortality would be lost, together with all the faculties of
 Mind; but being cannot be lost while God ex-   
 ists. Soul and matter are at variance from the
 very necessity of their opposite natures. Mortals are
 unacquainted with the reality of existence, because matter 
 and mortality do not reflect the facts of Spirit.
 <p></p><p>Spiritual vision is not subordinate to geometric altitudes. Whatever is governed by God, is never for an 
 instant deprived of the light and might of intelligence
 and Life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Light and darkness</font></p>
 We are sometimes led to believe that darkness is as real 
 as light; but Science affirms darkness to be only a mortal
 sense of the absence of light, at the coming of
 which darkness loses the appearance of reality. 
 So sin and sorrow, disease and death, are the suppositional
 absence of Life, God, and flee as phantoms of error before
 truth and love. 
           
 With its divine proof, Science reverses the evidence of
 material sense. Every quality and condition of mortality
 is lost, swallowed up in immortality. Mortal man is the 
 antipode of immortal man in origin, in existence, and in his
 relation to God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Faith of Socrates</font></p>
 Because he understood the superiority and immortality of good, Socrates feared not the hemlock poison.
 Even the faith of his philosophy spurned physical timidity. Having sought man's spiritual 
 state, he recognized the immortality of man. The ignorance and malice of the age would have killed the vener<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_216%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216 </font></a></p><p></p><p>able philosopher because of his faith in Soul and his indifference to the body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The serpent of error</font></p>
 Who shall say that man is alive to-day, but may be dead
 to-morrow? What has touched Life, God, to such
 strange issues? Here theories cease, and Science unveils the mystery and solves the problem of man. Error bites the heel of truth, but cannot kill
 truth. Truth bruises the head of error--destroys error.
 Spirituality lays open siege to materialism. On which
 side are we fighting?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Servants and masters</font></p>
 The understanding that the Ego is Mind, and that
 there is but one Mind or intelligence, begins at once to
 destroy the errors of mortal sense and to supply
 the truth of immortal sense. This understanding makes the body harmonious; it makes the nerves,
 bones, brain, etc., servants, instead of masters. If man
 is governed by the law of divine Mind, his body is in submission to everlasting Life and Truth and Love. The
 great mistake of mortals is to suppose that man, God's
 image and likeness, is both matter and Spirit, both good
 and evil.
 <p></p><p>If the decision were left to the corporeal senses, evil
 would appear to be the master of good, and sickness to
 be the rule of existence, while health would seem the
 exception, death the inevitable, and life a paradox. Paul
 asked: "What concord hath Christ with Belial?" (2 Corinthians vi. 15.)
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Personal identity</font></p>
 When you say, "Man's body is material," I say with
 Paul: Be "willing rather to be absent from the body,
 and to be present with the Lord." Give up
 your material belief of mind in matter, and
 have but one Mind, even God; for this Mind forms its
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a></p><p></p><p>own likeness. The loss of man's identity through the 
 understanding which Science confers is impossible; and
 the notion of such a possibility is more absurd than to 
 conclude that individual musical tones are lost in the
 origin of harmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Paul's experience</font></p>
 Medical schools may inform us that the healing work 
 of Christian Science and Paul's peculiar Christian conversion and experience,--which prove Mind 
 to be scientifically distinct from matter,--are    
 indications of unnatural mental and bodily conditions,
 even of catalepsy and hysteria; yet if we turn to the Scriptures, what do we read? Why, this: "If a man keep my 
 saying, he shall never see death!" and "Henceforth know
 we no man after the flesh!"
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fatigue is mental</font></p>
 That scientific methods are superior to others, is 
 seen by their effects. When you have once conquered
 a diseased condition of the body through 
 Mind, that condition never recurs, and you 
 have won a point in Science. When mentality gives
 rest to the body, the next toil will fatigue you less, for
 you are working out the problem of being in divine metaphysics; and in proportion as you understand the control which Mind has over so-called matter, you will be
 able to demonstrate this control. The scientific and 
 permanent remedy for fatigue is to learn the power of
 Mind over the body or any illusion of physical weariness,
 and so destroy this illusion, for matter cannot be weary 
 and heavy-laden.
 <p></p><p>You say, "Toil fatigues me." But what is this me!
 Is it muscle or mind? Which is tired and so speaks?
 Without mind, could the muscles be tired? Do the
 muscles talk, or do you talk for them? Matter is non</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_218%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218 </font></a></p><p></p><p>intelligent. Mortal mind does the false talking, and that
 which affirms weariness, made that weariness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind never weary</font></p>
 You do not say a wheel is fatigued; and yet the body
 is as material as the wheel. If it were not for what the
 human mind says of the body, the body, like
 the inanimate wheel, would  never  be  weary.
 The consciousness of Truth rests us more than hours of
 repose in unconsciousness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Coalition of sin and sickness</font></p>
 The body is supposed to say, "I am ill." The reports
 of sickness may form a coalition with the reports of sin,
 and say, "I am malice, lust, appetite, envy,
 hate." What renders both  sin  and  sickness
 difficult of cure is, that the human mind is the
 sinner, disinclined to self-correction, and believing that
 the body can be sick independently of mortal mind and
 that the divine Mind has no jurisdiction over the body.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness akin to sin</font></p>
 Why pray for the recovery of the sick, if you are without faith in God's willingness and ability to heal them?
 If you do believe in God, why do you substitute drugs for the Almighty's power, and
 employ means which lead only into  material  ways  of
 obtaining help, instead of turning in time of need to
 God, divine Love, who is an ever-present help?
 <p></p><p>Treat a belief in sickness as you would sin, with sudden
 dismissal. Resist the temptation to believe in matter as
 intelligent, as having sensation or power.
 </p><p></p><p>The Scriptures say, "They that wait upon  the  Lord
 . . . shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk,
 and not faint." The meaning of that passage is  not
 perverted by applying it literally to moments of fatigue,
 for the moral and physical are as one in their results.
 When we wake to the truth of being, all  disease,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a></p><p></p><p>pain, weakness, weariness, sorrow, sin, death, will be
 unknown, and the mortal dream will forever cease. My
 method of treating fatigue applies to all bodily ailments, 
 since Mind should be, and is, supreme, absolute, and
 final.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Affirmation and result</font></p>
 In mathematics, we do not multiply when we should 
 subtract, and then say the product is correct.  No more
 can we say in Science that muscles give strength,
 that nerves give pain or pleasure, or that matter 
 governs, and then expect that the result will be  harmony.
 Not muscles, nerves, nor bones, but mortal mind makes
 the whole body "sick, and the whole heart faint;" whereas 
 divine Mind heals.
 <p></p><p>When this is understood, we shall never affirm concerning the body what we do not wish to have manifested. We 
 shall not call the body weak, if we would have it strong;
 for the belief in feebleness must obtain in the human
 mind before it can be made manifest on the body, and 
 the destruction of the belief will be the removal of its
 effects. Science includes no rule of discord, but governs
 harmoniously. "The wish," says the poet, "is ever father 
 to the thought."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific beginning</font></p>
 We may hear a sweet melody, and yet misunderstand
 the science that governs it.  Those who are healed 
 through metaphysical Science, not comprehending the Principle of the cure, may misunderstand it, and impute their recovery to change of air or 
 diet, not rendering to God the honor due to Him alone.
 Entire immunity from the belief in sin, suffering, and
 death may not be reached at this period, but we may look 
 for an abatement of these evils; and this scientific beginning is in the right direction.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_220%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hygiene ineffectual</font></p>
 We hear it said: " I exercise daily in the open air. I
 take cold baths, in order to overcome a predisposition to
 take cold; and yet I have continual colds,
 catarrh, and cough." Such admissions ought
 to open people's eyes to the inefficacy of material hygiene,
 and induce sufferers to look in other directions for cause
 and cure.
 <p></p><p>Instinct is better than misguided reason, as even nature declares. The violet lifts her blue eye to greet the
 early spring. The leaves clap their hands as nature's
 untired worshippers.  The snowbird sings and soars
 amid the blasts; he has no catarrh from wet feet, and
 procures a summer residence with more ease than a nabob. The atmosphere of the earth, kinder than the atmosphere of mortal mind, leaves catarrh to the latter.
 Colds, coughs, and contagion are engendered solely by
 human theories.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The reflex phenomena</font></p>
 Mortal mind produces its own phenomena, and then
 charges them to something else,--like a kitten
 glancing into the mirror at itself and thinking
 it sees another kitten.
 <p></p><p>A clergyman once adopted a diet of bread and water
 to increase his spirituality. Finding his health failing,
 he gave up his abstinence, and advised others never to
 try dietetics for growth in grace.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Volition far-reaching</font></p>
 The belief that either fasting or feasting makes men
 better morally or physically is one of the fruits of "the
 tree of the knowledge of good and evil," concerning which God said, "Thou shalt not eat
 of it." Mortal mind forms all conditions of the mortal
 body, and controls the stomach, bones, lungs, heart, blood,
 etc., as directly as the volition or will moves the mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Starvation and dyspepsia</font></p>
 I knew a person who when quite a child adopted the 
 Graham system to cure dyspepsia. For many years, he
 ate only bread and vegetables, and drank noth-  
 ing but water. His dyspepsia increasing, he  
 decided that his diet should be more rigid, and
 thereafter he partook of but one meal in twenty-four 
 hours, this meal consisting of only a thin slice of bread
 without water. His physician also recommended that
 he should not wet his parched throat until three hours 
 after eating. He passed many weary years in hunger
 and weakness, almost in starvation, and finally made up
 his mind to die, having exhausted the skill of the doctors, 
 who kindly informed him that death was indeed his only
 alternative. At this point Christian Science saved him,
 and he is now in perfect health without a vestige of the 
 old complaint.
 <p></p><p>He learned that suffering and disease were the selfimposed beliefs of mortals, and not the facts of being; 
 that God never decreed disease,--never ordained a law
 that fasting should be a means of health. Hence semistarvation is not acceptable to wisdom, and it is equally 
 far from Science, in which being is sustained by God, Mind.
 These truths, opening his eyes, relieved his stomach, and
 he ate without suffering, "giving God thanks;" but he 
 never enjoyed his food as he had imagined he would
 when, still the slave of matter, he thought of the fleshpots of Egypt, feeling childhood's hunger and undisciplined by self-denial and divine Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind and stomach</font></p>
 This new-born understanding, that neither food nor
 the stomach, without the consent of mortal  
 mind, can make one suffer, brings with it an-  
 other lesson,--that gluttony is a sensual illusion, and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_222%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222 </font></a></p><p></p><p>that this phantasm of mortal mind disappears as we better
 apprehend our spiritual existence and ascend the ladder
 of life.
 </p><p></p><p>This person learned that food affects the body only
 as mortal mind has its material methods of working, one
 of which is to believe that proper food supplies nutriment
 and strength to the human system. He learned also that
 mortal mind makes a mortal body, whereas Truth regenerates this fleshly mind and feeds thought with the
 bread of Life.
 </p><p></p><p>Food had less power to help or to hurt him after he
 had availed himself of the fact that Mind governs man,
 and he also had less faith in the so-called pleasures and
 pains of matter. Taking less thought about what he
 should eat or drink, consulting the stomach less about
 the economy of living and God more, he recovered
 strength and flesh rapidly. For many years he had
 been kept alive, as was believed, only by the strictest adherence to hygiene and drugs, and yet he continued ill
 all the while. Now he dropped drugs and material
 hygiene, and was well.
 </p><p></p><p>He learned that a dyspeptic was very far from being
 the image and likeness of God, - far from having "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
 air, and over the cattle," if eating a bit of animal flesh
 could overpower him. He finally concluded that God
 never made a dyspeptic, while fear, hygiene, physiology,
 and physics had made him one, contrary to His commands.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life only in Spirit</font></p>
 In seeking a cure for dyspepsia consult matter not at
 all, and eat what is set before you, "asking
 no question for conscience sake." We  must
 destroy the false belief that life and intelligence are in
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p><p></p><p>matter, and plant ourselves upon what is pure and perfect. Paul said, "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
 fulfil the lust of the flesh." Sooner or later we shall learn 
 that the fetters of man's finite capacity are forged by the
 illusion that he lives in body instead of in Soul, in matter
 instead of in Spirit.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul greater than body       </font></p>
 Matter does not express Spirit. God is infinite omnipresent Spirit. If Spirit is all and is everywhere, what
 and where is matter? Remember that truth 
 is greater than error, and we cannot put the 
 greater into the less. Soul is Spirit, and Spirit is greater
 than body. If Spirit were once within the body, Spirit 
 would be finite, and therefore could not be Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The question of the ages</font></p>
 The question, "What is Truth," convulses the world.
 Many are ready to meet this inquiry with the assurance 
 which comes of understanding; but more are 
 blinded by their old illusions, and try to "give
 it pause." "If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into 
 the ditch."
 <p></p><p>The efforts of error to answer this question by some
 ology are vain. Spiritual rationality and free thought accompany approaching Science, and cannot be put down.
 They will emancipate humanity, and supplant unscientific
 means and so-called laws.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Heralds of Science      </font></p>
 Peals that should startle the slumbering thought from
 its erroneous dream are partially unheeded; but the last
 trump has not sounded, or this would not be 
 so. Marvels, calamities, and sin will much 
 more abound as truth urges upon mortals its resisted
 claims; but the awful daring of sin destroys sin, and 
 foreshadows the triumph of truth.   God will overturn, until "He come whose right it is." Longevity
 <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_224%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224 </font></a></p><p></p><p>is increasing and the power of sin diminishing, for the,
 world feels the alterative effect of truth through every
 pore.
 </p><p></p><p>As the crude footprints of the past disappear from the
 dissolving paths of the present, we shall better understand
 the Science which governs these changes, and shall plant
 our feet on firmer ground. Every sensuous pleasure  or
 pain  is  self-destroyed  through  suffering.  There  should
 be painless progress, attended by life and peace instead
 of discord and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sectarianism and opposition</font></p>
 In the record of nineteen centuries, there  are  sects
 many  but  not  enough  Christianity.  Centuries  ago  religionists were ready to hail an anthropomorphic God, and array His vicegerent with pomp
 and splendor; but this was not the  manner
 of truth's appearing. Of old the cross was truth's central sign, and it is to-day. The modern lash is less
 material than the Roman scourge, but it is equally as
 cutting.  Cold  disdain,  stubborn  resistance,  opposition
 from church, state laws, and the press, are still the harbingers of truth's full-orbed appearing.
 <p></p><p>A  higher  and  more  practical  Christianity,  demonstrating justice and meeting the needs of mortals in sickness
 and in health, stands at the door of this age, knocking
 for admission. Will you open or close the door upon this
 angel visitant, who cometh in the quiet of meekness, as he
 came of old to the patriarch at noonday?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental emancipation</font></p>
 Truth brings the elements of liberty. On its  banner
 is the Soul-inspired motto, "Slavery  is  abolished."  The
 power of God brings deliverance to the captive.  No  power  can  withstand  divine  Love.
 What is this supposed power, which opposes itself to God?
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p><p></p><p>Whence cometh it? What is it that binds man with iron 
 shackles to sin, sickness, and death? Whatever enslaves
 man is opposed to the divine government. Truth makes
 man free.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth's ordeal</font></p>
 You may know when first Truth leads by the fewness and faithfulness of its followers. Thus it is that
 the march of time bears onward freedom's 
 banner. The powers of this world will fight, 
 and will command their sentinels not to let truth pass
 the guard until it subscribes to their systems; but Science,
 heeding not the pointed bayonet, marches on. There is
 always some tumult, but there is a rallying to truth's 
 standard.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immortal sentences</font></p>
 The history of our country, like all history, illustrates
 the might of Mind, and shows human power to be proportionate to its embodiment of right thinking. A 
 few immortal sentences, breathing the omnipotence of divine justice, have been potent to break despotic 
 fetters and abolish the whipping-post and slave market;
 but oppression neither went down in blood, nor did the
 breath of freedom come from the cannon's mouth. Love 
 is the liberator.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Slavery abolished</font></p>
 Legally to abolish unpaid servitude in the United
 States was hard; but the abolition of mental slavery is 
 a more difficult task. The despotic tendencies, inherent in mortal mind and always germinating in new forms of tyranny, must be rooted out 
 through the action of the divine Mind.
 <p></p><p>Men and women of all climes and races are still in
 bondage to material sense, ignorant how to obtain their
 freedom. The rights of man were vindicated in a single
 section and on the lowest plane of human life, when Afri</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_226%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226 </font></a></p><p></p><p>can slavery was abolished in our land. That was only
 prophetic of further steps towards the banishment of a
 world-wide slavery, found on higher planes of existence
 and under more subtle and depraving forms.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Liberty's crusade</font></p>
 The voice of God in behalf of the African slave was
 still echoing in our land, when the voice of the herald of
 this new crusade sounded the keynote of universal freedom, asking a fuller acknowledgment of the rights of man as a Son of God, demanding
 that the fetters of sin, sickness, and death be stricken
 from the human mind and that its freedom be won, not
 through human warfare, not with bayonet and blood, but
 through Christ's divine Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Cramping systems</font></p>
 God has built a higher platform of human rights, and
 He has built it on diviner claims. These claims are not
 made through code or creed, but in demonstration of "on earth peace, good-will toward men."
 Human codes, scholastic theology, material medicine and
 hygiene, fetter faith and spiritual understanding. Divine
 Science rends asunder these fetters, and man's birthright
 of sole allegiance to his Maker asserts itself.
 <p></p><p>I saw before me the sick, wearing out years of servitude to an unreal master in the belief that the body governed them, rather than Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">House of bondage</font></p>
 The lame, the deaf, the dumb, the blind, the sick, the
 sensual, the sinner, I wished to save from the slavery of
 their own beliefs and from the educational
 systems of the Pharaohs, who to-day, as of
 yore, hold the children of Israel in bondage. I saw before me the awful conflict, the Red Sea and the wilderness; but I pressed on through faith in God, trusting
 Truth, the strong deliverer, to guide me into the land
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p><p></p><p>of Christian Science, where fetters fall and the rights of
 man are fully known and acknowledged.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Higher law ends bondage</font></p>
 I saw that the law of mortal belief included  all error,
 and that, even as oppressive laws are disputed and  mortals are taught their right to freedom, so the
 claims of the enslaving senses must be denied and superseded. The law of the divine Mind must
 end human bondage, or mortals will continue unaware
 of man's inalienable rights and in subjection to hopeless slavery, because some public teachers permit
 an ignorance of divine power,--an ignorance that
 is the foundation of continued bondage and of human 
 suffering.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Native freedom</font></p>
 Discerning the rights of man, we cannot fail to foresee the doom of all oppression. Slavery is not the legitimate state of man. God made man free. 
 Paul said, "I was free born." All men should
 be free. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Love and Truth make free, but evil and error
 lead into captivity.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Standard of liberty</font></p>
 Christian Science raises the standard of liberty and 
 cries: "Follow me! Escape from the bondage of sickness, sin, and death!" Jesus marked out the 
 way. Citizens of the world, accept the "glorious liberty of the children of God," and be free! This
 is your divine right. The illusion of material sense, not
 divine law, has bound you, entangled your free limbs, 
 crippled your capacities, enfeebled your body, and defaced the tablet of your being.
 <p></p><p>If God had instituted material laws to govern man, 
 disobedience to which would have made man ill, Jesus
 would not have disregarded those laws by healing in
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_228%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228 </font></a></p><p></p><p>direct opposition to them and in defiance of all material
 conditions.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No fleshly heredity</font></p>
 The transmission of disease or of certain idiosyncrasies of mortal mind would be impossible if this great fact
 of being were learned,--namely, that nothing
 inharmonious can enter being, for Life is God.
 Heredity is a prolific subject for mortal belief to pin theories upon; but if we learn that nothing is real but the
 right, we shall have no dangerous inheritances, and fleshly
 ills will disappear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God-given dominion</font></p>
 The enslavement of man is not legitimate. It will
 cease when man enters into his heritage of freedom, his
 God-given dominion over the material senses.
 Mortals will some day assert their freedom in
 the name of Almighty God. Then they will control their
 own bodies through the understanding of divine Science.
 Dropping their present beliefs, they will recognize harmony as the spiritual reality and discord as the material
 unreality.
 <p></p><p>If we follow the command of our Master, "Take no
 thought for your life," we shall never depend on bodily
 conditions, structure, or economy, but we shall be masters
 of the body, dictate its terms, and form and control it with
 Truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Priestly pride humbled</font></p>
 There is no power apart from God. Omnipotence has
 all-power, and to acknowledge any other power is to dishonor God. The humble Nazarene overthrew
 the supposition that sin, sickness, and death
 have power. He proved them powerless. It should have
 humbled the pride of the priests, when they saw the demonstration of Christianity excel the influence of their dead
 faith and ceremonies.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a></p><p></p><p>If Mind is not the master of sin, sickness, and death,
 they are immortal, for it is already proved that matter has not destroyed them, but is their basis and 
 support.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No union of opposites</font></p>
 We should hesitate to say that Jehovah sins or suffers;
 but if sin and suffering are realities of being, whence did 
 they emanate? God made all that was made, 
 and Mind signifies God,--infinity, not finity. 
 Not far removed from infidelity is the belief which 
 unites such opposites as sickness and health, holiness
 and unholiness, calls both the offspring of spirit, and
 at the same time admits that Spirit is God, - virtually declaring Him good in one instance and evil in
 another.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Self-constituted law</font></p>
 By universal consent, mortal belief has constituted 
 itself a law to bind mortals to sickness, sin, and death.
 This customary belief is misnamed material
 law, and the individual who upholds it is mistaken in theory and in practice. The so-called law of
 mortal mind, conjectural and speculative, is made void
 by the law of immortal Mind, and false law should be 
 trampled under foot.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness from mortal mind</font></p>
 If God causes man to be sick, sickness must be good,
 and its opposite, health, must be evil, for all that He 
 makes is good and will stand forever. If the 
 transgression of God's law produces sickness, it 
 is right to be sick; and we cannot if we would, and should 
 not if we could, annul the decrees of wisdom. It is the
 transgression of a belief of mortal mind, not of a law of
 matter nor of divine Mind, which causes the belief of sickness. The remedy is Truth, not matter,--the truth that
 disease is unreal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_230%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230 </font></a></p><p></p><p>If sickness is real, it belongs to immortality; if true,
 it is a part of Truth. Would you attempt with drugs,
 or without, to destroy a quality or condition of Truth?
 But if sickness and sin are illusions, the awakening from
 this mortal dream, or illusion, will bring us into health,
 holiness, and immortality. This awakening is the forever coming of Christ, the advanced appearing of Truth,
 which casts out error and heals the sick. This is the salvation which comes through God, the divine Principle,
 Love, as demonstrated by Jesus.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God never inconsistent</font></p>
 It would be contrary to our highest ideas of God to
 suppose Him capable of first arranging law and causation
 so as to bring about certain evil results, and
 then punishing the helpless victims of His volition for doing what they could not avoid doing. Good
 is not, cannot be, the author of experimental sins. God,
 good, can no more produce sickness than goodness can
 cause evil and health occasion disease.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental narcotics</font></p>
 Does wisdom  make  blunders  which  must  afterwards
 be rectified by man? Does a law of God produce sickness, and can man put that law under his feet
 by healing sickness? According to Holy Writ,
 the sick are never really healed by drugs, hygiene, or any
 material  method.  These  merely  evade  the  question.
 They are soothing syrups to put children to sleep, satisfy
 mortal belief, and quiet fear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true healing</font></p>
 We think that we are healed when a disease disappears, though it is liable to reappear; but we are never
 thoroughly healed until the liability to be
 ill is removed. So-called mortal mind or the
 mind of mortals being the remote, predisposing,  and
 the exciting cause of all suffering, the cause of disease
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p><p></p><p>must be obliterated through Christ in divine Science, or 
 the so-called physical senses will get the victory.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Destruction of all evil</font></p>
 Unless an ill is rightly met and fairly overcome by 
 Truth, the ill is never conquered. If God destroys not
 sin, sickness, and death, they are not destroyed in the mind of mortals, but seem to 
 this so-called mind to be immortal. What God cannot
 do, man need not attempt. If God heals not the sick,
 they are not healed, for no lesser power equals the infinite 
 All-power; but God, Truth, Life, Love, does heal the
 sick through the prayer of the righteous.
 <p></p><p>If God makes sin, if good produces evil, if truth results 
 in error, then Science and Christianity are helpless; but
 there are no antagonistic powers nor laws, spiritual or
 material, creating and governing man through perpetual 
 warfare. God is not the author of mortal discords.
 Therefore we accept the conclusion that discords have
 only a fabulous existence, are mortal beliefs which divine 
 Truth and Love destroy.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Superiority to sickness and sin</font></p>
 To hold yourself superior to sin, because God made
 you superior to it and governs man, is true wisdom. To 
 fear sin is to misunderstand the power of Love
 and the divine Science of being in man's relation to God,--to doubt His government and  
 distrust His omnipotent care. To hold yourself superior
 to sickness and death is equally wise, and is in accordance
 with divine Science. To fear them is impossible, when
 you fully apprehend God and know that they are no part
 of His creation.
 <p></p><p>Man, governed by his Maker, having no other Mind, planted on the Evangelist's statement that "all things
 were made by Him [the Word of God]; and without
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_232%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232 </font></a></p><p></p><p>Him was not anything made that was made,"--can
 triumph over sin, sickness, and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Denials of divine power</font></p>
 Many theories relative to God and man neither make
 man harmonious nor God lovable. The beliefs we commonly entertain about happiness and life
 afford no scatheless and permanent evidence
 of either. Security for the claims of harmonious and
 eternal being is found only in divine Science.
 <p></p><p>Scripture informs us that "with God all things are
 possible," - all good is possible to Spirit; but our prevalent theories practically deny this, and make healing
 possible only through matter. These theories must be
 untrue, for the Scripture is true. Christianity is not
 false, but religions which contradict its Principle are
 false.
 </p><p>In our age Christianity is again demonstrating the
 power of divine Principle, as it did over nineteen hundred years ago, by healing the sick and triumphing over
 death. Jesus never taught that drugs, food, air, and exercise could make a man healthy, or that they could destroy human life; nor did he illustrate these errors by his
 practice. He referred man's harmony to Mind, not to
 matter, and never tried to make of none effect the sentence of God, which sealed God's condemnation of sin,
 sickness, and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Signs following</font></p>
 In the sacred sanctuary of Truth are voices of solemn import, but we heed them not. It is only when the
 so-called pleasures and pains of sense pass
 away in our lives, that we find unquestionable signs of the burial of error and the resurrection to
 spiritual life.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Profession and proof</font></p>
 There is neither place nor opportunity in Science for error
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a></p><p></p><p>of any sort. Every day makes its demands upon us for 
 higher proofs rather than professions of Christian power.
 These proofs consist solely in the destruction 
 of sin, sickness, and death by the power of
 Spirit, as Jesus destroyed them. This is an element of
 progress, and progress is the law of God, whose law demands of us only what we can certainly fulfil.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perfection gained slowly</font></p>
 In the midst of imperfection, perfection is seen and
 acknowledged only by degrees. The ages must slowly
 work up to perfection. How long it must be 
 before we arrive at the demonstration of scientific being, no man knoweth,--not even "the 
 Son but the Father;" but the false claim of error  continues its delusions until the goal of goodness is assiduously earned and won.   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christ's mission</font></p>
 Already the shadow of His right hand rests upon the
 hour. Ye who can discern the face of the sky,--the
 sign material,--how much more should ye 
 discern the sign mental, and compass the destruction of sin and sickness by overcoming the thoughts
 which produce them, and by understanding the spiritual 
 idea which corrects and destroys them. To reveal this
 truth was our Master's mission to all mankind, including
 the hearts which rejected him.    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Efficacy of truth  </font></p>
 When numbers have been divided according to a fixed
 rule, the quotient is not more unquestionable than the
 scientific tests I have made of the effects of 
 truth upon the sick. The counter fact relative to any disease is required to cure it. The utterance
 of truth is designed to rebuke and destroy error. Why 
 should truth not be efficient in sickness, which is solely
 the result of inharmony?
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_234%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234 </font></a></p><p></p><p>Spiritual draughts heal, while material lotions interfere
 with truth, even as ritualism and creed hamper spirituality. If we trust matter, we distrust Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Crumbs of comfort</font></p>
 Whatever inspires with wisdom, Truth, or Love--be
 it song, sermon, or Science--blesses the human family
 with crumbs of comfort from Christ's table
 feeding the hungry and giving living waters to
 the thirsty.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hospitality to health and good</font></p>
 We should become more familiar with good than with
 evil, and guard against false beliefs as watchfully as we
 bar our doors against the approach of thieves
 and murderers. We should love our enemies
 and help them on the basis of the Golden
 Rule; but avoid casting pearls before those who trample
 them under foot, thereby robbing both themselves and
 others.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Cleansing the mind</font></p>
 If mortals would keep proper ward over mortal mind,
 the brood of evils which infest it would be cleared out.
 We must begin with this so-called mind and
 empty it of sin and sickness, or sin and sickness will never cease. The present codes  of  human
 systems disappoint the weary searcher after  a  divine
 theology, adequate to the  right  education  of  human
 thought.
 <p></p><p>Sin and disease must be thought before they can be
 manifested. You must control evil thoughts in the first
 instance, or they will control you in the second. Jesus
 declared that to look with desire on forbidden objects was
 to break a moral precept. He laid great stress on the
 action of the human mind, unseen to the senses.
 </p><p></p><p>Evil thoughts and aims reach no farther and do no more
 harm than one's belief permits. Evil thoughts, lusts, and
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p><p></p><p>malicious purposes cannot go forth, like wandering pollen, 
 from one human mind to another, finding unsuspected
 lodgment, if virtue and truth build a strong defence. 
 Better suffer a doctor infected with smallpox to attend
 you than to be treated mentally by one who does not obey
 the requirements of divine Science. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Teachers' functions</font></p>
 The teachers of schools and the readers in churches
 should be selected with as direct reference to their
 morals as to their learning or their correct 
 reading. Nurseries of character should be 
 strongly garrisoned with virtue. School-examinations are
 one-sided; it is not so much academic education, as a 
 moral and spiritual culture, which lifts one higher. The
 pure and uplifting thoughts of the teacher, constantly
 imparted to pupils, will reach higher than the heavens of 
 astronomy; while the debased and unscrupulous mind,
 though adorned with gems of scholarly attainment, will
 degrade the characters it should inform and elevate. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physicians' privilege</font></p>
 Physicians, whom the sick employ in their helplessness,
 should be models of virtue. They should be wise spiritual guides to health and hope. To the tremblers on the brink of death, who understand  
 not the divine Truth which is Life and perpetuates being,
 physicians should be able to teach it. Then when the soul 
 is willing and the flesh weak, the patient's feet may be
 planted on the rock Christ Jesus, the true idea of spiritual
 power.          
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Clergymen's duty</font></p>
 Clergymen, occupying the watchtowers of the world,
 should uplift the standard of Truth. They should so raise
 their hearers spiritually, that their listeners
 will love to grapple with a new, right idea 
 and broaden their concepts. Love of Christianity, rather
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_236%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236 </font></a></p><p></p><p>than love of popularity, should stimulate clerical labor
 and progress. Truth should emanate from the pulpit,
 but never be strangled there. A special privilege is vested
 in the ministry. How shall it be used? Sacredly, in the
 interests of humanity, not of sect.
 </p><p></p><p>Is it not professional reputation and emolument rather
 than the dignity of God's laws, which many leaders seek?
 Do not inferior motives induce the infuriated attacks on
 individuals, who reiterate Christ's teachings in support
 of his proof by example that the divine Mind heals sickness as well as sin?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A mother's responsibility</font></p>
 A mother is the strongest educator, either for or
 against crime. Her thoughts form the embryo of another mortal mind, and unconsciously mould
 it, either after a model odious to herself or
 through divine influence, "according to the pattern
 showed to thee in the mount." Hence the importance
 of Christian Science, from which we learn of the one
 Mind and of the availability of good as the remedy for
 every woe.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Children's tractability</font></p>
 Children should obey their parents; insubordination
 is an evil, blighting the buddings of self-government.
 Parents should teach their children at the
 earliest possible period the truths of health
 and holiness. Children are more tractable than adults,
 and learn more readily to love the simple verities that will
 make them happy and good.
 <p></p><p>Jesus loved little children because of their freedom
 from wrong and their receptiveness of right. While
 age is halting between two opinions or battling with
 false beliefs, youth makes easy and rapid strides towards
 Truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a></p><p></p><p>A little girl, who had occasionally listened to my explanations, badly wounded her finger. She seemed not
 to notice it. On being questioned about it she answered
 ingenuously, "There is no sensation in matter." Bounding off with laughing eyes, she presently added, "Mamma,
 my finger is not a bit sore."  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soil and seed      </font></p>
 It might have been months or years before her parents
 would have laid aside their drugs, or reached the mental
 height their little daughter so naturally attained. The more stubborn beliefs and theories of parents often choke the good seed in the minds of
 themselves and their offspring. Superstition, like "the 
 fowls of the air," snatches away the good seed before it
 has sprouted.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Teaching children</font></p>
 Children should be taught the Truth-cure, Christian 
 Science, among their first lessons, and kept from discussing or entertaining theories or thoughts about 
 sickness. To prevent the experience of error  
 and its sufferings, keep out of the minds of your children
 either sinful or diseased thoughts. The latter should
 be excluded on the same principle as the former. This 
 makes Christian Science early available.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deluded invalids</font></p>
 Some invalids are unwilling to know the facts or to
 hear about the fallacy of matter and its supposed laws. 
 They devote themselves a little longer to their 
 material gods, cling to a belief in the life and 
 intelligence of matter, and expect this error to do more 
 for them than they are willing to admit the only living and
 true God can do. Impatient at your explanation, unwilling to investigate the Science of Mind which would rid 
 them of their complaints, they hug false beliefs and suffer
 the delusive consequences.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_238%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Patient waiting</font></p>
 Motives and acts are not rightly valued before they are
 understood. It is well to wait till those whom you would
 benefit are ready for the blessing, for Science
 is working changes in personal character as
 well as in the material universe.
 <p></p><p>To obey the Scriptural command, "Come out from
 among them, and be ye separate," is to incur society's
 frown; but this frown, more than flatteries, enables one
 to be Christian. Losing her crucifix, the Roman Catholic
 girl said, "I have nothing left but Christ." "If God be
 for us, who can be against us?"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unimproved opportunities</font></p>
 To fall away from Truth in times of persecution, shows
 that we never understood Truth. From out the bridal
 chamber of wisdom there will come the warning, "I know you not." Unimproved opportunities will rebuke us when we attempt to claim the
 benefits of an experience we have not made our own, try
 to reap the harvest we have not sown, and wish to enter
 unlawfully into the labors of others. Truth often remains
 unsought, until we seek this remedy for human woe because we suffer severely from error.
 <p></p><p>Attempts to conciliate society and so gain dominion over
 mankind, arise from worldly weakness. He who leaves
 all for Christ forsakes popularity and gains Christianity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Society and intolerance</font></p>
 Society is a foolish juror, listening only to one side of
 the case. Justice often comes too late to secure a verdict.
 People with mental work before them have
 no time for gossip about false law or testimony.
 To reconstruct timid justice and place the fact above the
 falsehood, is the work of time.
 <p></p><p>The cross is the central emblem of history. It is the
 lodestar in the demonstration of Christian healing,--the
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p><p></p><p>demonstration by which sin and sickness are  destroyed. 
 The sects, which endured the lash of their predecessors,
 in their turn lay it upon those who are in advance of 
 creeds.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Right views of humanity</font></p>
 Take away wealth, fame, and social organizations,
 which weigh not one jot in the balance of God, and we 
 get clearer views of Principle. Break up 
 cliques, level wealth with honesty, let worth
 be judged according to wisdom, and we get better views 
 of humanity.
 <p></p><p>The wicked man is not the ruler of his upright
 neighbor. Let it be understood that success in error is 
 defeat in Truth. The watchword of Christian Science
 is Scriptural: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
 unrighteous man his thoughts." 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Standpoint revealed      </font></p>
 To ascertain our progress, we must learn where our
 affections are placed and whom we acknowledge and
 obey as God.  If divine Love is becoming 
 nearer, dearer, and more real to us, matter is 
 then submitting to Spirit. The objects we pursue and
 the spirit we manifest reveal our standpoint, and show 
 what we are winning.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Antagonistic sources</font></p>
 Mortal mind is the acknowledged seat of human motives. It forms material concepts and produces every 
 discordant action of the body. If action proceeds from the divine Mind, action is harmo-  
 nious. If it comes from erring mortal mind, it is discordant and ends in sin, sickness, death. Those two opposite
 sources never mingle in fount or stream. The perfect
 Mind sends forth perfection, for God is Mind. Imperfect mortal mind sends forth its own resemblances, of
 which the wise man said, "All is vanity."
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_240%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Some lessons from nature</font></p>
 Nature voices natural, spiritual law and divine Love,
 but human belief misinterprets nature. Arctic regions,
 sunny tropics, giant hills, winged winds,
 mighty billows, verdant vales, festive flowers,
 and glorious heavens,--all point to Mind, the spiritual
 intelligence they reflect. The floral apostles are hieroglyphs of Deity. Suns and planets teach grand lessons.
 The stars make night beautiful, and the leaflet turns naturally towards the light.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Perpetual motions</font></p>
 In the order of Science, in which the Principle is above
 what it reflects, all is one grand concord. Change this
 statement, suppose Mind to be governed by
 matter or Soul in body, and you lose the keynote of being, and there is continual discord. Mind is
 perpetual motion. Its symbol is the sphere. The rotations and revolutions of the universe of Mind go on
 eternally.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Progress demanded</font></p>
 Mortals move onward towards good or evil as time
 glides on. If mortals are not progressive, past failures
 will be repeated until all wrong work is effaced or rectified. If at present satisfied with
 wrong-doing, we must learn to loathe it. If at present
 content with idleness, we must become dissatisfied with
 it. Remember that mankind must sooner or later, either
 by suffering or by Science, be convinced of the error that
 is to be overcome.
 <p></p><p>In trying to undo the errors of sense one must pay fully
 and fairly the utmost farthing, until all error is finally
 brought into subjection to Truth. The divine  method
 of paying sin's wages involves unwinding one's snarls
 and learning from experience how to divide between sense
 and Soul.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a></p><p></p><p>"Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth." He, who 
 knows God's will or the demands of divine Science and
 obeys them, incurs the hostility of envy; and he who 
 refuses obedience to God, is chastened by Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The doom of sin</font></p>
 Sensual treasures are laid up "where moth and rust
 doth corrupt." Mortality is their doom. Sin breaks in
 upon them, and carries off their fleeting joys. 
 The sensualist's affections are as imaginary, 
 whimsical, and unreal as his pleasures. Falsehood, envy, 
 hypocrisy, malice, hate, revenge, and so forth, steal away
 the treasures of Truth.  Stripped of its coverings, what
 a mocking spectacle is sin! 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit transforms       </font></p>
 The Bible teaches transformation of the body by the
 renewal of Spirit. Take away the spiritual signification
 of Scripture, and that compilation can do no  
 more for mortals than can moonbeams to melt  
 a river of ice. The error of the ages is preaching without
 practice.   
          
 The substance of all devotion is the reflection and
 demonstration of divine Love, healing sickness and
 destroying sin. Our Master said, "If ye love me, keep 
 my commandments."
 <p></p><p>One's aim, a point beyond faith, should be to find the
 footsteps of Truth, the way to health and holiness. We 
 should strive to reach the Horeb height where God is revealed; and the corner-stone of all spiritual building is
 purity. The baptism of Spirit, washing the body of all 
 the impurities of flesh, signifies that the pure in heart
 see God and are approaching spiritual Life and its
 demonstration.    
   
 </p><p><font size="1">Spiritual baptism      </font></p>
 It is "easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
 needle," than for sinful beliefs to enter the kingdom of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_242%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242 </font></a></p><p></p><p>heaven, eternal harmony. Through repentance, spiritual
 baptism, and regeneration, mortals put off their material
 beliefs and false individuality. It is only a
 question of time when "they shall all know
 Me [God], from the least of them unto the greatest."
 Denial of the claims of matter is a great step towards
 the joys of Spirit, towards human freedom and the final
 triumph over the body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The one only way</font></p>
 There is but one way to heaven, harmony, and Christ
 in divine Science shows us this way. It is to know no
 other reality - to have no other consciousness of life - than good, God and His reflection, and to rise superior to the so-called pain and pleasure
 of the senses.
 <p></p><p>Self-love is more opaque than a solid body. In patient obedience to a patient God, let us labor to dissolve with the universal solvent of Love the adamant
 of error, - self-will, self-justification, and self-love, which wars against spirituality and is the law of sin
 and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divided vestments</font></p>
 The vesture of Life is Truth. According to the Bible,
 the facts of being are commonly misconstrued, for it is
 written: "They parted my raiment among
 them, and for my vesture they did cast lots."
 The divine Science of man is woven into one web of
 consistency without seam or rent. Mere speculation or
 superstition appropriates no part of the divine vesture,
 while inspiration restores every part of the Christly garment of righteousness.
 <p></p><p>The finger-posts of divine Science show the way our
 Master trod, and require of Christians the proof which
 he gave, instead of mere profession. We may hide
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a></p><p></p><p>spiritual ignorance from the world, but we can never 
 succeed in the Science and demonstration of spiritual
 good through ignorance or hypocrisy.  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ancient and modern miracles</font></p>
 The divine Love, which made harmless the   poisonous
 viper, which delivered men from the boiling oil, from
 the fiery furnace, from the jaws of the lion, 
 can heal the sick in every age and triumph 
 over sin and death.  It crowned the demonstrations of Jesus with unsurpassed power and love. But 
 the same "Mind . . . which was also in Christ Jesus"
 must always accompany the letter of Science in order to
 confirm and repeat the ancient demonstrations of prophets 
 and apostles. That those wonders are not more commonly repeated to-day, arises not so much from lack of
 desire as from lack of spiritual growth.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental telegraphy    </font></p>
 The clay cannot reply to the potter. The head, heart,
 lungs, and limbs do not inform us that they are dizzy,
 diseased, consumptive, or lame. If this in-    
 formation is conveyed, mortal mind conveys  
 it. Neither immortal and unerring Mind nor matter,
 the inanimate substratum of mortal mind, can carry 
 on such telegraphy; for God is "of purer eyes than
 to behold evil," and matter has neither intelligence nor
 sensation.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Annihilation of error         </font></p>
 Truth has no consciousness of error. Love has no
 sense of hatred. Life has no partnership 
 with death. Truth, Life, and Love are a law 
 of annihilation to everything unlike themselves, because
 they declare nothing except God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deformity and perfection</font></p>
 Sickness, sin, and death are not the fruits of Life. 
 They are inharmonies which Truth destroys. Perfection
 does not animate imperfection. Inasmuch as God is
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_244%20%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244  </font></a></p><p></p><p>good and the fount of all being, He does not produce
 moral or physical deformity; therefore such deformity is
 not real, but is illusion, the mirage of error.
 Divine Science reveals these grand facts. On
 their basis Jesus demonstrated Life, never
 fearing nor obeying error in any form.
 </p><p></p><p>If we were to derive all our conceptions of man from
 what is seen between the cradle and the grave, happiness and goodness would have no abiding-place in man,
 and the worms would rob him of the flesh; but Paul
 writes: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
 made me free from the law of sin and death."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man never less than man</font></p>
 Man undergoing birth, maturity, and decay is like the
 beasts and vegetables,--subject to laws of decay. If
 man were dust in his earliest stage of existence, we might admit the hypothesis that he
 returns eventually to his primitive condition;
 but man was never more nor less than man.
 <p></p><p>If man flickers out in death or springs from matter into
 being, there must be an instant when God is without His
 entire manifestation,--when there is no full reflection
 of the infinite Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man not evolved</font></p>
 Man in Science is neither young nor old. He has
 neither birth nor death. He is not a beast, a vegetable,
 nor a migratory mind. He does not pass from
 matter to Mind, from the mortal to the immortal, from evil to good, or from good to evil. Such
 admissions cast us headlong into darkness and dogma.
 Even Shakespeare's poetry pictures age as infancy, as
 helplessness and decadence, instead of assigning to man
 the everlasting grandeur and immortality of development,
 power, and prestige.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a></p><p></p><p>The error of thinking that we are growing old, and the 
 benefits of destroying that illusion, are illustrated in a
 sketch from the history of an English woman, published 
 in the London medical magazine called The Lancet.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perpetual youth</font></p>
 Disappointed in love in her early years, she became
 insane and lost all account of time. Believing that she 
 was still living in the same hour which parted 
 her from her lover, taking no note of years, 
 she stood daily before the window watching for her 
 lover's coming. In this mental state she remained young.
 Having no consciousness of time, she literally grew no
 older. Some American travellers saw her when she was 
 seventy-four, and supposed her to be a young woman.
 She had no care-lined face, no wrinkles nor gray hair, but
 youth sat gently on cheek and brow. Asked to guess her 
 age, those unacquainted with her history conjectured that
 she must be under twenty.
 <p></p><p>This instance of youth preserved furnishes a useful 
 hint, upon which a Franklin might work with more certainty than when he coaxed the enamoured lightning
 from the clouds. Years had not made her old, because 
 she had taken no cognizance of passing time nor thought
 of herself as growing old. The bodily results of her belief
 that she was young manifested the influence of such a belief. She could not age while believing herself young, for
 the mental state governed the physical.
 </p><p></p><p>Impossibilities never occur. One instance like the 
 foregoing proves it possible to be young at seventy-four;
 and the primary of that illustration makes it plain that
 decrepitude is not according to law, nor is it a necessity of 
 nature, but an illusion.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man reflects God</font></p>
 The infinite never began nor will it ever end. Mind
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p><p></p><p>and its formations can never be annihilated. Man is not
 a pendulum, swinging between evil and good, joy and
 sorrow, sickness and health, life and death.
 Life and its faculties are not measured by
 calendars. The perfect and immortal are the eternal
 likeness of their Maker. Man is by no means a material
 germ rising from the imperfect and endeavoring to reach
 Spirit above his origin. The stream rises no higher than
 its source.
 </p><p></p><p>The measurement of life by solar years robs youth and
 gives ugliness to age. The radiant sun of virtue and truth
 coexists with being. Manhood is its eternal noon, undimmed by a declining sun. As the physical and material, the transient sense of beauty fades, the radiance of
 Spirit should dawn upon the enraptured sense with bright
 and imperishable glories.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Undesirable records</font></p>
 Never record ages. Chronological data are no part
 of the vast forever. Time-tables of birth and death are
 so many conspiracies against manhood and
 womanhood. Except for the error of measuring and limiting all that is good and beautiful, man
 would enjoy more than threescore years and ten and
 still maintain his vigor, freshness, and promise. Man,
 governed by immortal Mind, is always beautiful and
 grand. Each succeeding year unfolds wisdom, beauty,
 and holiness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True life eternal</font></p>
 Life is eternal. We should find this out, and begin the
 demonstration thereof. Life and goodness are immortal.
 Let us then shape our views of existence into
 loveliness, freshness, and continuity, rather
 than into age and blight.
 <p></p><p>Acute and chronic beliefs reproduce their own types.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p><p></p><p>The acute belief of physical life comes on at a remote 
 period, and is not so disastrous as the chronic belief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eyes and teeth renewed</font></p>
 I have seen age regain two of the elements it had lost, 
 sight and teeth. A woman of eighty-five, whom I knew,
 had a return of sight. Another woman at 
 ninety had new teeth, incisors, cuspids, bicuspids, and one molar. One man at sixty
 had retained his full set of upper and lower teeth without
 a decaying cavity.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eternal beauty       </font></p>
 Beauty, as well as truth, is eternal; but the beauty
 of material things passes away, fading and fleeting as
 mortal belief. Custom, education, and fashion 
 form the transient standards of mortals. Immortality, exempt from age or decay, has a glory of its
 own,--the radiance of Soul. Immortal men and women
 are models of spiritual sense, drawn by perfect Mind
 and reflecting those higher conceptions of loveliness
 which transcend all material sense.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine loveliness    </font></p>
 Comeliness and grace are independent of matter. Being possesses its qualities before they are perceived humanly. Beauty is a thing of life, which 
 dwells forever in the eternal Mind and reflects the charms of His goodness in expression, form,
 outline, and color. It is Love which paints the petal
 with myriad hues, glances in the warm sunbeam, arches
 the cloud with the bow of beauty, blazons the night with
 starry gems, and covers earth with loveliness.  
   
 The embellishments of the person are poor substitutes
 for the charms of being, shining resplendent and eternal
 over age and decay.      
    
 The recipe for beauty is to have less illusion and
 more Soul, to retreat from the belief of pain or pleasure
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a></p><p></p><p>in the body into the unchanging calm and glorious freedom of spiritual harmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Love's endowment</font></p>
 Love never loses sight of loveliness. Its halo rests upon
 its object. One marvels that a friend can ever seem less
 than beautiful. Men and women of riper
 years and larger lessons ought to ripen into
 health and immortality, instead of lapsing into darkness
 or gloom. Immortal Mind feeds the body with supernal
 freshness and fairness, supplying it with beautiful images
 of thought and destroying the woes of sense which each
 day brings to a nearer tomb.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental sculpture</font></p>
 The sculptor turns from the marble to his model in
 order to perfect his conception. We are all sculptors,
 working at various forms, moulding and chiseling thought. What is the model before mortal
 mind? Is it imperfection, joy, sorrow, sin, suffering?
 Have you accepted the mortal model? Are you reproducing it? Then you are haunted in your work by vicious
 sculptors and hideous forms. Do you not hear from all
 mankind of the imperfect model? The world is holding
 it before your gaze continually. The result is that you
 are liable to follow those lower patterns, limit your lifework, and adopt into your experience the angular outline
 and deformity of matter models.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perfect models</font></p>
 To remedy this, we must first turn our gaze in the right
 direction, and then walk that way. We must form perfect
 models in thought and look at them continually,
 or we shall never carve them out in grand and
 noble lives. Let unselfishness, goodness, mercy, justice,
 health, holiness, love--the kingdom of heaven--reign
 within us, and sin, disease, and death will diminish until
 they finally disappear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a></p><p></p><p>Let us accept Science, relinquish all theories based on
 sense-testimony, give up imperfect models and illusive
 ideals; and so let us have one God, one Mind, and that 
 one perfect, producing His own models of excellence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Renewed selfhood</font></p>
 Let the "male and female" of God's creating appear.
 Let us feel the divine energy of Spirit, bringing us into 
 newness of life and recognizing no mortal nor 
 material power as able to destroy. Let us rejoice that we are subject to the divine "powers that be." 
 Such is the true Science of being. Any other theory of
 Life, or God, is delusive and mythological.
 <p></p><p>Mind is not the author of matter, and the creator of
 ideas is not the creator of illusions. Either there is no
 omnipotence, or omnipotence is the only power. God is
 the infinite, and infinity never began, will never end, and 
 includes nothing unlike God. Whence then is soulless
 matter?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Illusive dreams</font></p>
 Life is, like Christ, "the same yesterday, and to-day, 
 and forever." Organization and time have nothing to do
 with Life. You say, "I dreamed last night."
 What a mistake is that! The I is Spirit. God 
 never slumbers, and His likeness never dreams. Mortals
 are the Adam dreamers.
 <p></p><p>Sleep and apath are phases of the dream that life, substance, and intelligence are material. The mortal nightdream is sometimes nearer the fact of being than are the
 thoughts of mortals when awake. The night-dream has
 less matter as its accompaniment. It throws off some
 material fetters. It falls short of the skies, but makes its
 mundane flights quite ethereal. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Philosophical blunders      </font></p>
 Man is the reflection of Soul. He is the direct opposite of material sensation, and there is but one Ego. We
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p><p></p><p>run into error when we divide Soul into souls, multiply
 Mind into minds and suppose error to be mind, then mind
 to be in matter and matter to be a lawgiver,
 unintelligence to act like intelligence, and mortality to be the matrix of immortality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit the one Ego</font></p>
 Mortal existence is a dream; mortal existence has no
 real entity, but saith "It is I." Spirit is the Ego which
 never dreams, but understands all things;
 which never errs, and is ever conscious; which
 never believes, but knows; which is never born and
 never dies. Spiritual man is the likeness of this Ego.
 Man is not God, but like a ray of light which comes from
 the sun, man, the outcome of God, reflects God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal existence a dream</font></p>
 Mortal body and mind are one, and that one is called
 man; but a mortal is not man, for man is immortal. A
 mortal may be weary or pained, enjoy or suffer,
 according to the dream he entertains in sleep.
 When that dream vanishes, the mortal finds himself
 experiencing none of these dream-sensations. To the
 observer, the body lies listless, undisturbed, and sensationless, and the mind seems to be absent.
 <p></p><p>Now I ask, Is there any more reality in the waking
 dream of mortal existence than in the sleeping dream?
 There cannot be, since whatever appears to be a mortal
 man is a mortal dream. Take away the mortal mind,
 and matter has no more sense as a man than it has as
 a tree. But the spiritual, real man is immortal.
 </p><p></p><p>Upon this stage of existence goes on the dance of mortal
 mind. Mortal thoughts chase one another like snowflakes,
 and drift to the ground. Science reveals Life as not being
 at the mercy of death, nor will Science admit that happiness is ever the sport of circumstance.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error self-destroyed</font></p>
 Error is not real, hence it is not more imperative 
 as it hastens towards self-destruction.  The so-called
 belief of mortal mind apparent as an abscess 
 should not grow more painful before it suppurates neither should a fever become more severe before
 it ends.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Illusion of death         </font></p>
 Fright is so great at certain stages of mortal belief
 as to drive belief into new paths. In the illusion of
 death, mortals wake to the knowledge of two 
 facts: (1) that they are not dead; (2) that 
 they have but passed the portals of a new belief. Truth
 works out the nothingness of error in just these ways.
 Sickness, as well as sin, is an error that Christ, Truth,
 alone can destroy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal mind's disappearance</font></p>
 We must learn how mankind govern the body, whether through faith in hygiene, in drugs, or in willpower. We should learn whether they govern 
 the body through a belief in the necessity of 
 sickness and death, sin and pardon, or govern 
 it from the higher understanding that the divine Mind
 makes perfect, acts upon the so-called human mind 
 through truth, leads the human mind to relinquish all
 error, to find the divine Mind to be the only Mind,
 and the healer of sin, disease, death. This process of 
 higher spiritual understanding improves mankind until
 error disappears, and nothing is left which deserves to
 perish or to be punished.      
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual ignorance  </font></p>
 Ignorance, like intentional wrong, is not Science.
 Ignorance must be seen and corrected before we can attain harmony. Inharmonious beliefs, which 
 rob Mind, calling it matter, and deify their  
 own notions, imprison themselves in what they create.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p><p></p><p>They are at war with Science, and as our Master said,
 "If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
 cannot stand."
 </p><p></p><p>Human ignorance of Mind and of the recuperative
 energies of Truth occasions the only skepticism regarding the pathology and theology of Christian Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eternal man recognized</font></p>
 When false human beliefs learn even a little of their
 own falsity, they begin to disappear. A knowledge of
 error and of its operations must precede that
 understanding of Truth which destroys error,
 until the entire mortal, material error finally disappears,
 and the eternal verity, man created by and of Spirit,
 is understood and recognized as the true likeness of his
 Maker.
 <p></p><p>The false evidence of material sense contrasts strikingly
 with the testimony of Spirit. Material sense lifts its voice
 with the arrogance of reality and says:
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Testimony of sense</font></p>
 I am wholly dishonest, and no man knoweth it. I can
 cheat, lie, commit adultery, rob, murder, and I elude
 detection by smooth-tongued villainy. Animal in propensity, deceitful in sentiment,
 fraudulent in purpose, I mean to make my short span
 of life one gala day. What a nice thing is sin! How
 sin succeeds, where the good purpose waits! The world
 is my kingdom. I am enthroned in the gorgeousness
 of matter. But a touch, an accident, the law of God,
 may at any moment annihilate my peace, for all my
 fancied joys are fatal. Like bursting lava, I expand but
 to my own despair, and shine with the resplendency of
 consuming fire.
 <p></p><p>Spirit, bearing opposite testimony, saith:
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Testimony of Soul</font></p>
 I am Spirit. Man, whose senses are spiritual, is my
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p><p></p><p>likeness. He reflects the infinite understanding, for I am 
 Infinity. The beauty of holiness, the perfection of being,
 imperishable glory,--all are Mine, for I am 
 God. I give immortality to man, for I am 
 Truth. I include and impart all bliss, for I am Love.
 I give life, without beginning and without end, for I am 
 Life. I am supreme and give all, for I am Mind. I am
 the substance of all, because I AM THAT I AM.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Heaven-bestowed prerogative</font></p>
 I hope, dear reader, I am leading you into the understanding of your divine rights, your heaven-bestowed harmony,--that, as you read, you see there is no 
 cause (outside of erring, mortal, material sense 
 which is not power) able to make you sick or 
 sinful; and I hope that you are conquering this false sense.
 Knowing the falsity of so-called material sense, you can 
 assert your prerogative to overcome the belief in sin, disease, or death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Right endeavor possible</font></p>
 If you believe in and practise wrong knowingly, you 
 can at once change your course and do right. Matter can
 make no opposition to right endeavors against 
 sin or sickness, for matter is inert, mindless. 
 Also, if you believe yourself diseased, you can 
 alter this wrong belief and action without hindrance from
 the body.    
         
 Do not believe in any supposed necessity for sin, disease, or death, knowing (as you ought to know) that God
 never requires obedience to a so-called material law, for 
 no such law exists. The belief in sin and death is destroyed by the law of God, which is the law of Life instead of death, of harmony instead of discord, of Spirit 
 instead of the flesh.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Patience and final perfection</font></p>
 The divine demand, "Be ye therefore perfect," is sci<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_254%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254 </font></a></p><p></p><p>entific, and the human footsteps leading to perfection are
 indispensable. Individuals are consistent who, watching
 and praying, can "run, and not be weary; . . .
 walk, and not faint," who gain good rapidly
 and hold their position, or attain slowly and
 yield not to discouragement. God requires perfection,
 but not until the battle between Spirit and flesh is fought
 and the victory won. To stop eating, drinking, or being
 clothed materially before the spiritual facts of existence
 are gained step by step, is not legitimate. When we wait
 patiently on God and seek Truth righteously, He directs
 our path. Imperfect mortals grasp the ultimate of spiritual perfection slowly; but to begin aright and to continue the strife of demonstrating the great problem of
 being, is doing much.
 </p><p></p><p>During the sensual ages, absolute Christian Science
 may not be achieved prior to the change called death,
 for we have not the power to demonstrate what we do
 not understand. But the human self must be evangelized. This task God demands us to accept lovingly
 to-day, and to abandon so fast as practical the material,
 and to work out the spiritual which determines the outward and actual.
 </p><p></p><p>If you venture upon the quiet surface of error and are
 in sympathy with error, what is there to disturb the waters?
 What is there to strip off error's disguise?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The cross and crown</font></p>
 If you launch your bark upon the ever-agitated but
 healthful waters of truth, you will encounter storms.
 Your good will be evil spoken of. This is the
 cross. Take it up and bear it, for through it
 you win and wear the crown. Pilgrim on earth, thy home
 is heaven; stranger, thou art the guest of God.
