 <h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 
 
 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 
 
 <h2>VIII.  That No One of Existing Things doth Perish, but Men in
 
 
 
 Error Speak of Their Changes as Destructions and as Deaths</h2>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;The idea of cyclic change central to CH III, "The Sacred
 
 
 
 Sermon", also takes center stage here.  A current of ancient
 
 
 
 speculation grounded in astrology held that as the planets returned
 
 
 
 after vast cycles of time to the same positions, so all events
 
 
 
 on earth would repeat themselves precisely into eternity in the
 
 
 
 future - and had done so from eternity in the past.  The technical
 
 
 
 term for this recurrence, <i>apocatastasis</i>, is the word Mead
 
 
 
 translates as "restoration" in the beginning of section
 
 
 
 4.
 
 
 
 <p>
 
 
 
 &lt;Mead footnotes this tractate as "obscure" and "faulty"
 
 
 
 in places, and his translation of the beginning of section 3 is
 
 
 
 conjectural. - JMG&gt;

 1.  [Hermes:]  Concerning Soul and Body, son, we now must speak;
 
 
 
 in what way Soul is deathless, and whence comes the activity in
 
 
 
 composing and dissolving Body.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For there's no death for aught of things [that are]; the thought
 
 
 
 this word conveys, is either void of fact, or [simply] by the
 
 
 
 knocking off a syllable what is called "death", doth
 
 
 
 stand for "deathless".
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For death is of destruction, and nothing in the Cosmos is destroyed.
 
 
 
  For if Cosmos is second God, a life &lt;or living creature&gt;
 
 
 
 that cannot die, it cannot be that any part of this immortal life
 
 
 
 should die.  All things in Cosmos are parts of Cosmos, and most
 
 
 
 of all is man, the rational animal.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 2.  For truly first of all, eternal and transcending birth, is
 
 
 
 God the universals' Maker.  Second is he "after His image",
 
 
 
 Cosmos, brought into being by Him, sustained and fed by Him, made
 
 
 
 deathless, as by his own Sire, living for aye, as ever free from
 
 
 
 death.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Now that which ever-liveth, differs from the Eternal; for He hath
 
 
 
 not been brought to being by another, and even if He have been
 
 
 
 brought to being, He hath not been brought to being by Himself,
 
 
 
 but ever is brought into being.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For the Eternal, in that It is eternal, is the all.  The Father
 
 
 
 is Himself eternal of Himself, but Cosmos hath become eternal
 
 
 
 and immortal by the Father.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 3.  And of the matter stored beneath it &lt;i.e., beneath the
 
 
 
 cosmos&gt;, the Father made of it a universal body, and packing
 
 
 
 it together made it spherical - wrapping it round the life - [a
 
 
 
 sphere] which is immortal in itself, and that doth make materiality
 
 
 
 eternal.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But He, the Father, full-filled with His ideas, did sow the lives
 
 
 
 &lt;or living creatures&gt; into the sphere, and shut them in
 
 
 
 as in a cave, willing to order forth the life with every kind
 
 
 
 of living.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 So He with deathlessness enclosed the universal body, that matter
 
 
 
 might not wish to separate itself from body's composition, and
 
 
 
 so dissolve into its own [original] unorder.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For matter, son, when it was yet incorporate &lt;i.e., not yet
 
 
 
 formed into bodies&gt;, was in unorder.  And it doth still retain
 
 
 
 down here this [nature of unorder] enveloping the rest of the
 
 
 
 small lives &lt;or living creatures&gt; - that increase-and-decrease
 
 
 
 which men call death.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 4.  It is round earthly lives that this unorder doth exist.  For
 
 
 
 that the bodies of the heavenly ones preserve one order allotted
 
 
 
 to them by the Father as their rule; and it is by the restoration
 
 
 
 of each one [of them] this order is preserved indissolute.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The "restoration" of bodies on the earth is thus their
 
 
 composition, whereas their dissolution restores them to those
 
 
 
 bodies which can never be dissolved, that is to say, which know
 
 
 
 no death.  Privation, thus, of sense is brought about, not loss
 
 
 
 of bodies.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 5.  Now the third life - Man, after the image of the Cosmos made,
 
 
 
 [and] having mind, after the Father's will, beyond all earthly
 
 
 
 lives - not only doth have feeling with the second God &lt;i.e.,
 
 
 
 the Cosmos&gt;, but also hath conception of the first; for of
 
 
 
 the one 'tis sensible as of a body, while of the other it conceives
 
 
 
 as bodiless and the Good Mind.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Tat:  Doth then this life not perish?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Hermes:  Hush, son!  and understand what God, what Cosmos [is],
 
 
 
 what is a life that cannot die, and what a life subject to dissolution.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Yea, understand the Cosmos is by God and in God; but Man by Cosmos
 
 
 
 and in Cosmos.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The source and limit and the constitution of all things is God.
