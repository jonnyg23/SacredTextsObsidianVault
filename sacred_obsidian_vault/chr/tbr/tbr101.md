   <h3 align="center">The Ages of the Ages</h3>  
 <p>As the "Creative Ages" were the "Alpha" Ages, these will be the "Omega" Ages. With the surrender of the "Perfect Kingdom" to the Father, what we speak of as "Time" ceases, and the "Eternal Ages," called the "Ages of the Ages" begin. They correspond to what the Apostle Paul in his Letter to the Ephesians calls the "Ages to Come." Eph. 2:7. And John in the Book of Revelation says that the "Devil" and the "Beast" and the "False Prophet" shall be tormented day and night forever and ever, or for the "<b>Aions</b>" of the "<b>Aions</b>," the "<b>Ages of the Ages</b>," Rev. 20:10, and that the "Servants of God" shall reign for the same period. Rev. 22:5.</p>  
 <p>What those "Ages of Ages" shall reveal of the Plan and Purpose of God we do not know, but if we are His we shall live to know, and possibly take part in their development. What we do know is that we are but in the <b>beginning of things</b>, and as concerning the "Ages," Eternity is still young.</p>
