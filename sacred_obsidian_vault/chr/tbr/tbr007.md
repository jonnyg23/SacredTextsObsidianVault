 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"<b>JOHN</b> to the <b>Seven Churches which are in Asia</b>: Grace be unto you, and peace, from <b>Him</b> which <b>Is</b>, and which <b>Was</b>, and which <b>IS TO COME</b>; and from the '<b>Seven Spirits</b>' which are before <b>HIS Throne</b>; and from <b>Jesus Christ</b> who is the <b>FAITHFUL WITNESS</b>, and the <b>FIRST BEGOTTEN OF THE DEAD</b>, and the <b>PRINCE OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</b>. Unto Him that <b>LOVED US</b> and <b>WASHED (Loosed) US</b> from our sins in His own blood. And hath made us <b>KINGS</b> and <b>PRIESTS</b> unto God and His Father; to Him be <b>glory</b> and <b>dominion</b> for ever and ever. Amen."</font></dir>  
 <p>The Salutation is addressed to the "<b>Seven Churches Which Are In Asia</b>." By Asia is not meant the great Continent of Asia, or even the whole of Asia Minor, but only the western end of Asia Minor bordering on the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, and about the size of the State of Pennsylvania. Neither do these Seven Churches mean that there were only seven churches in that district, for there were at least <b>three</b> other churches, that of Colosse, Col. 1:2; Hierapolis, Col. 4:13; and Troas, Acts 20:6-7. These seven Churches then must be representative or typical churches, chosen for certain characteristics typical of the character of the Church of Christ, not only in that day, but on down the centuries until the Church shall be removed from the earth, and represent <b>seven church periods</b> clearly defined in Church History. This we shall see, in our study of chapters two and three, to be the case.</p>

 <p>In the Benediction--"Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him which <b>is</b>, and which <b>was</b>, and which <b>is to come</b>; and from the Seven Spirits which are before His Throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the Faithful Witness, etc.," we behold the Trinity. Here Jesus is distinguished from--"<b>HIM</b> (the Father) which <b>Is</b>, and which <b>Was</b>, and which <b>Is To Come</b>," but in verse 8, He claims the same Title, which only proves that Jesus was God manifest in the flesh, and that He and the Father are <b>one</b>.</p>  
 <p>It is also worthy of note that the "Threefold Office" of Jesus, as <b>PROPHET</b>, <b>PRIEST</b>, and <b>KING</b> is brought out in the Salutation. He is called the "<b>Faithful Witness</b>," as such he is a <b>PROPHET</b>. As the "<b>First Begotten From The Dead</b>," He carried His own blood into the Heavenly Tabernacle, and thus performed the work of a <b>PRIEST</b>. As the "<b>Prince Of The Kings Of The Earth</b>," as He will be when He takes the Throne, He will be a <b>KING</b>. As <b>Prophet</b> Jesus is God's <b>WORD</b>, as <b>Priest</b> He is God's <b>LAMB</b>, and as <b>King</b> He is God's <b>LION</b>.</p>  
 <p>John also emphasizes the fact that Jesus <b>LOVED</b> us <b>before</b> He <b>WASHED</b> (Loosed) us from our sins in His own blood, and that He has made us "Kings" and "Priests" unto God, and that we need no human Priest to stand between us and God.</p>
