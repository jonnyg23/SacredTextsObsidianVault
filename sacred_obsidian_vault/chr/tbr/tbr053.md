   <h3 align="center">5. THE JEWISH REMNANT.</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 12:17.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And the Dragon was wroth with the 'WOMAN,' and went to make war with the '<b>REMNANT OF HER SEED</b>,' which keep the <b>commandments of God</b>, and have the <b>testimony of Jesus Christ</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p>Baffled in his attempt to destroy the "Woman," the Dragon, in his rage will make war against the "<b>REMNANT OF HER SEED</b>," that is, against those Israelites left in Palestine or among the nations that keep the "<b>commandments of God</b>," and have the "<b>testimony of Jesus Christ</b>." To this end he will give to the "<b>BEAST</b>" (Antichrist) his "<b>Power</b>," and his "<b>Seat</b>," and "<b>Great Authority</b>." Rev. 13:2.</p>  
 <p>Here again we have indirect evidence that the "<b>Woman</b>" is not the Church but <b>ISRAEL</b>. When the Church is caught out no <b>REMNANT</b> is left behind, all that are "<b>IN CHRIST</b>" are taken away; but when the "Woman" (<b>ISRAEL</b>) flees into the wilderness a "<b>REMNANT</b>" is left behind. This "Remnant" is composed of two classes'. First, those who "<b>keep the Commandments of God</b>," that is, Orthodox Jews who observe the Old Testament Law, and second, those who "<b>accept the testimony of Jesus Christ</b>," that is, accept Jesus as their promised Messiah. The latter class will be converted by the preaching of the "Gospel of the Kingdom" by the "Two Witnesses." Those will be trying times for those Israelites who will not commit idolatry by bowing the knee to the "Image of the Beast," for it will be a remorseless war of persecution that Antichrist will wage against them, and thousands will die a martyr's death.</p>
