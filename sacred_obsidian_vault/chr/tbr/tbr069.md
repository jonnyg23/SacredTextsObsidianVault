   <h3 align="center">THE TABERNACLE OF TESTIMONY.</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 15:5-8.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And after that I looked, and behold, the Temple of the '<b>TABERNACLE OF TESTIMONY</b>' in Heaven was opened: and the 'Seven Angels' came out of the Temple, having the '<b>SEVEN PLAGUES</b>,' clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with Golden Girdles. And one of the 'Four Beasts' gave unto the 'Seven Angels' '<b>SEVEN GOLDEN VIALS</b>' full of the '<b>WRATH OF GOD</b>,' who liveth for ever and ever. And the Temple was filled with smoke from the Glory of God, and from His Power: and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the '<b>SEVEN PLAGUES</b>' of the 'Seven Angels' were fulfilled."</font></dir>  
 <p>Here again we see the Heavenly Temple. The "Seven Angels" that come out of it are clothed in priestly garments, and the "Golden Vials" that they carry were given them by one of the "Beasts" or Living Creatures, which one is not mentioned, and when he gave them to them the Heavenly Temple was filled with <b>smoke</b>. When the Tabernacle was finished by Moses, and the Temple by Solomon, there was a "<b>cloud</b>," the "Shekinah Glory," but <b>no smoke</b>. Ex. 40:34-36. 1. Kings 8:10-11. The "<b>cloud</b>" means <b>GRACE</b>, the "<b>smoke</b>" means <b>JUDGMENT</b>. Isa. 6:14. Ex. 19:18.</p>
