   <h3 align="center">SECOND TRUMPET.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(The Burning Mountain.)</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 8:8-9.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And the '<b>SECOND ANGEL</b>' sounded, and <b>as it were</b> a <b>'GREAT MOUNTAIN' burning with fire</b> was cast into the sea: and the <b>third part of the sea BECAME BLOOD</b>; and the <b>third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, DIED</b>; and the <b>third part of the ships were DESTROYED</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p>As this "<b>MOUNTAIN</b>" is to fall on the <b>sea</b>, and the Judgments poured forth by the "Trumpets" and "Vials" are to fall mainly on that part of the world bordering on the Mediterranean Sea, it is highly probable that the "<b>SEA</b>" here mentioned is the Mediterranean Sea.</p>  
 <p>Notice that John does not say that it <b>was</b> a "Mountain" that he saw cast into the sea, but that it <b>appeared like a mountain</b>, not a burning volcano, but an <b>immense meteoric mass ablaze with fire</b>. That was as near as John could describe it. The effect of this "<b>burning mass</b>" on the sea, into which it fell, was to turn a <b>third part of the sea</b> into <b>BLOOD</b>. If any are disposed to doubt the possibility of such a thing let them turn to the "First Egyptian Plague" Ex. 7:19-21, and read the account of the turning of the waters of the River Nile into <b>BLOOD</b>. "And all the waters that were in the river were turned to <b>BLOOD</b>. And the <b>fish</b> that was in the river <b>DIED</b>; and the river <b>STANK</b>, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river: and there was <b>BLOOD</b> throughout <b>ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</b>." The only difference between the "First Egyptian Plague," and the effect on the Mediterranean Sea by the falling of a "Meteor" into it at the sounding of the Second Trumpet, will be, that only <b>1/3 of the sea</b> shall become <b>BLOOD</b>, that where the "Meteor" strikes, and thus only <b>1/3 of the living creatures</b> in the sea shall <b>DIE</b>. <b>One-third also of the ships</b> shall be <b>DESTROYED</b>, possibly by a tidal wave, or the "Meteor" may fall on a fleet of naval vessels, like the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada.</p>
