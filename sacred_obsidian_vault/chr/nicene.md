 A seemingly minor difference in the wording of this simple text had a
 profound impact on European history. The Nicene Creed, or Symbol of Faith,
 was written by the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325 C.E., with
 additions (the 3rd paragraph and following) by the first Council of
 Constantinople (381). There is an unresolved controversy over the words 'and
 the Son' (in Latin <i>filioque</i>). This language was added in 587 by the local
 council of Toledo, Spain, in an attempt to combat the Arian heresy. Pope Leo
 III (795-816) forbade the use of the <i>filioque</i> version and had it engraved
 without 'and the Son' on the walls of St. Peter's Basillica.  After a failed
 attempt to unite by marriage Charlemagne's Frankish holdings with that of
 the Byzantine Empress, Charlemagne challenged Byzantinium's claim of
 universal jurisdiction as the successor to Rome by claiming in 792 that
 among other things, that the Byzantines had omitted the <i>filioque</i> from the
 original text.  The <i>filioque</i> was finally accepted
 by the Romans in the year
 1014, and the revision has been part of Catholic doctrine ever since.  The
 "<i>filioque</i>," the significance of Roman primacy, and geo-political conflict
 led to the the Great Schism of 1053.  To this day, the Eastern Orthodox
 Churches do not accept the <i>filioque</i> and raise this as one of many reasons
 that prevent re-unification with the Roman Catholic Church.

 <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
 
 </p><p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten
 of  the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God
 of  very  God;  begotten, not made, being of one  substance  with  the
 Father, by whom all things were made.
 
 </p><p>Who,  for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven,  and  was
 incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and
 was  crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered  and  was
 buried;  and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;
 and  ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of  the  Father;
 and  He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead;
 whose kingdom shall have no end.
 
 </p><p>And  I  believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of  Life;  who
 proceeds from the Father <i>and the Son</i>; who with the Father
 <i>and the  Son</i>
 together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.
 
 </p><p>And  I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge
 one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection
 of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.
