 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.ii-p3"></a>WE pray to enter within the super-bright gloom, and through not seeing and not  knowing, to see and to know that the not to see nor to know is itself the above  sight and knowledge. For this is veritably to see and to know and to celebrate super-essentially  the Superessential, through the abstraction of all existing things, just as those  who make a lifelike statue, by extracting all the encumbrances which have been placed  upon the clear view of the concealed, and by bringing to light, by the mere cutting  away <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">60</font></a>
 , the genuine beauty concealed in it. And,  it is necessary, as I think, to celebrate the abstractions in an opposite way to  the definitions. For, we used to place these latter by beginning from the foremost  and descending through the middle to the lowest, but, in this case, by making the  ascents from the lowest to the highest, we abstract everything, in order that, without  veil, we may know that <i>Agnosia, </i>which is enshrouded under all the known,  in all things that be, and may see that superessential gloom, which is hidden by  all the light in existing things.</p>  <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.ii.ii-Page_134"></a>
