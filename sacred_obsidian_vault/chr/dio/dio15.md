 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT XII.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p1"></a>Concerning Holy of Holies, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God  of Gods.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p3"></a>BUT since whatever we have to say on these matters has reached, in my opinion,  a fitting conclusion, we must sing Him of endless names, both  <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_120"></a> as <i>Holy of Holies </i>and <i>King of Kings; </i>and as ruling  eternity and for ever and beyond, and as <i>Lord of Lords, </i>and <i>God of Gods. </i>And first we must say, what we think Holiness Itself is; and what Kingdom, and  what Lordship, and what Divinity, and what the Oracles wish to denote by the duplication  of the names.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p4"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p5"></a>Holiness then is (so far as we can say) the purity free from every pollution,  and all perfect, and altogether unstained; Kingdom is the assignment of every limit  and order, and ordinance and rank; and Lordship is not only the superiority over  the worse, but also the perfect possession, in. every respect, of the Beautiful  and Good; and a true and unswerving stability. Wherefore Lordship is parallel to <a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p5.1"></a>τὸ Κῦρος καί κύριον, καὶ τὸ κυριστῶν <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">56</font></a>
 ;  and Deity is the Providence watching over all, and with perfect goodness both circumscribing  and grasping all, and filling with Itself, and surpassing all things which enjoy  Its forethought.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p6"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p7"></a>These things, then, must be sung absolutely, respecting the Cause surpassing  all, and we must add that It surpasses Holiness, and Lordship, and Kingdom, and  most simplex <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">57</font></a>
  Deity. For, from It,  <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_121"></a>individually and collectively, were born and distributed every untarnished  distinctness of every spotless purity, the whole arrangement and regulation of things  existing, whilst It excludes want of harmony and want of equality, and want of symmetry,  and rejoices over the well-ordered identity and rectitude, and leads round things,  deemed worthy to participate in Itself. From It is all the perfect and complete  possession of all. good things, every good forethought, watching and sustaining  the objects of Its forethought, imparting Itself, as befits Its goodness, for deification  of those who are turned to It.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p8"></a>SECTION IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-p9"></a>But since the Cause of all is super-full of all, as beseems the One superfluity  which surpasses all, He is sung as <i>Holy of Holies </i>and the rest, as beseems  an overflowing Cause, and a towering Pre-eminence. As one might say, so far as the  things which are,--holy or divine, or lordly, or kingly,--surpass the things which  are not, and the self-existent participations, their participants; to such an extent  is seated above all things that be, He Who is above all things that be, and the  unparticipating Cause of all the participants and the participations. But Holy and  Kings and Lords and Gods, the Oracles call the higher orders in each, through whom  the inferior in participating the gifts from God, multiply the simplicity of their  distribution around their own diversities, the variety of which, the superior  <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xii-Page_122"></a> orders carefully and divinely collect to their own Oneness.</p>
