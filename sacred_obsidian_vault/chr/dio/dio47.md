 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.iv"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p0.1"></a>CAPUT IV.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p1"></a>What is meant by the appellation "Angels?"</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p3"></a>Now that the Hierarchy itself has been, in my judgment, sufficiently  defined, we must next extol the Angelic Hierarchy, and we must contemplate, with  supermundane eyes, its sacred formations, depicted in the Oracles, in order that  we may be borne aloft to their Divinely resplendent simplicity, through the mystic  representations, and may extol the source of all Hierarchical science with God-becoming  reverence and with thanksgivings. First of all, however,  <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv-Page_17"></a> let this truth be spoken --that it was through goodness that the superessential  Godhead, having fixed all the essences of things being, brought them into being.  For this is the peculiar characteristic of the Cause of all things, and of goodness  surpassing all, to call things being to participation of Itself, as each order of  things being was determined from its own analogy. For all things being share in  a Providence, which bubbles forth from the superessential Deity, Cause of all things.  For they would not be, unless they had participated in the Essence and Origin of  things being. All things then, without life, participate in It by their being. For  the being of all things is the Deity, above being; things living participate in  its life-giving power, above all life; things rational and intellectual participate  in its self-perfect and preeminently perfect wisdom, above all reason and mind.  It is evident, then, that all those Beings are around It, which have participated  in It, in many forms.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p5"></a>The holy orders, then, of the Heavenly Beings share in the supremely  Divine participation, in a higher degree than things which merely exist, or which  lead an irrational life, or which are rational like ourselves. For by moulding themselves  intelligibly to the Divine imitation, and looking supermundanely to the supremely  Divine likeness, and striving to mould their intellectual appearance, they naturally  have more ungrudging communications with It, being near and ever moving upwards,  as far as  <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv-Page_18"></a>lawful, elevating themselves with the intensity of the Divine unswerving  love, and receiving the primal illuminations without earthly stain, and ranging  themselves to these, and having their whole life intellectual. These, then, are  they who, at first hand, and under many forms, participate in the Divine, and, at  first hand, and under many forms, make known the supremely Divine Hiddenness. Wherefore,  beyond all, they are deemed pre-eminently worthy of the appellation Angelic, on  the ground that the supremely Divine illumination comes to them at first hand, and,  through them, there pass to us manifestations above us. Thus, then, the Law, as  the Word of God affirms, was given to us through the ministration of Angels <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">206</font></a>
 ; and Angels led our illustrious fathers <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">207</font></a>
   before the Law, and after the Law, to the Divine Being, either by leading <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">208</font></a>
   them to what was to be done, and by converting them from error, and an unholy life,  to the straight way of truth <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">209</font></a>
 , or by  making known to them sacred ordinances <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">210</font></a>
 ,  or hidden visions, or supermundane mysteries <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">211</font></a>
 , or certain Divine predictions through the Prophets <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">212</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p6"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p7"></a>But if any one should say that Divine manifestations were made  directly and immediately to some holy men <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">213</font></a>
 ,  let him learn, and that distinctly, from the most Holy Oracles, that no one hath  seen, nor  <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv-Page_19"></a>ever shall see, the "hidden" <a name="iv.ii.iv-p7.3"></a>τὸ κρύφιον  of Almighty God as it is in itself <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">214</font></a>
 .  Now Divine manifestations were made to the pious as befits revelations of God, that  is to say, through certain holy visions analogous to those who see them. Now the  all-wise Word of God (Theologia) naturally calls Theophany that particular  vision which manifests the Divine similitude depicted in itself as in a shaping  of the shapeless, from the elevation of the beholders to the Divine Being, since  through it a divine illumination comes to the beholders, and the divine persons  themselves are religiously initiated into some mystery. But our illustrious fathers  were initiated into these Divine visions, through the mediation of the Heavenly  Powers. Does not the tradition of the Oracles describe the holy legislation of the  Law, given to Moses, as coming straight from God, in order that it may teach us  this truth, that it is an outline of a Divine and holy legislation? But the Word  of God, in its Wisdom, teaches this also--that it came to us through Angels, as  though the Divine regulation were laying down this rule, that, through the first,  the second are brought to the Divine Being. For not only with regard to the superior  and inferior minds, but even for those of the same rank, this Law has been established  by the superessential supreme ordinance, that, within each Hierarchy, there are  first, and middle, and last ranks and powers, and that the more divine are instructors  <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv-Page_20"></a> and conductors of the less, to the Divine access, and illumination, and participation. </p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p8"></a>Section IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p9"></a>But I observe that Angels first were initiated in the Divine mystery  of the love of Jesus towards man, then, through them, the gift of its knowledge  passed to us. Thus, for example, the most divine Gabriel instructed Zachariah, the  Hierarch, that the son who was to be born to him, beyond hope, by Divine grace,  should be a prophet of the God-incarnate work of the Lord Jesus, to be manifested  to the world for its salvation, as becomes the Divine goodness; and he revealed  to Mary, how, in her, should be born the supremely Divine mystery of the unutterable  God-formation. Yet another Angel instructed Joseph, how, in very truth, should be  fulfilled the things Divinely promised to his ancestor David. Another declared glad  tidings to the shepherds, as being purified by their separation from the multitude,  and their quiet life, and, with him, a multitude of the Heavenly Host announced  to those on earth that often-sung doxology. Let us then ascend to the highest manifestations  of light contained in the Oracles, for I perceive that even Jesus Himself, the superessential  Cause of the super-heavenly Beings, when He had come to our condition, without change,  did not overstep the good order which becomes    <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv-Page_21"></a>mankind, which Himself arranged and took, but readily subjected Himself  to the dispositions of the Father and God, through Angels; and, through their mediation,  was announced to Joseph the departure of the Son to Egypt, which had been arranged  by the Father, and again the return to Judaea from Egypt. And through Angels we  see Him subjecting Himself to the Father’s decrees. For I forbear to speak, as addressing  one who knows the teaching of our hierarchical tradition, both concerning the Angel  who strengthened the Lord Jesus, or that even Jesus Himself, when He had come to  manifest the good work of our beneficent salvation, was called Angel of Great Counsel.  For, as He Himself says, after the manner of an Angel, "Whatsoever He heard from  the Father, He announced to us."</p>
