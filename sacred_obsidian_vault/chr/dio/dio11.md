 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT VIII.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p1"></a>Concerning power, justice, preservation, redemption, in which  also concerning inequality.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p3"></a>BUT since the theologians sing the Divine truth fulness and super-wise wisdom,  both as power and  <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_94"></a> as justice, and designate It preservation and redemption, come then,  let us unfold these Divine Names also, as best we can. Now, that the Godhead is  pre-eminent above, and surpasses every power, howsoever being and conceived, I do  not suppose any of those nourished in the Divine Oracles does not know. For on many  occasions the Word of God attributes the Lordship to It, even when distinguishing  It from the supercelestial powers themselves. How then do the theologians sing it  also as a Power, which is pre-eminent above every power? or how ought we to understand  the name of power as applied to It?</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p4"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p5"></a>We say, then, that Almighty God is Power, as pre-having, and super-having, every  power in Himself, and as Author of every power, and producing everything as beseems  a Power inflexible and unencompassed, and as being Author of the very existence  of power, either the universal or particular, and as boundless in power, not only  by the production of all power, but by being above all, even the self. existent  Power, and by His superior power, and by His bringing into existence, <i>ad infinitum, </i>endless powers other than the existing powers; and by the fact that the endless  powers, even when brought into existence without end, are not able to blunt the  super-endless production of His power-making power; and by the unutterable and unknown,  and inconceivable nature of His all-surpassing power, which,  <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_95"></a> through abundance of the powerful, gives power even to weakness, and  holds together and preserves the remotest of its echoes; as also we may see even  with regard to the powerful insensible perception, that the super-brilliant lights  reach even to obscure visions, and they say, that the loud sounds enter even into  ears which are not very well adapted to the reception of sounds. For that which  does not hear at all is not hearing; and that which does not see at all is not sight.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p6"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p7"></a>The distribution, then, of boundless power, from Almighty God, passes to all  beings, and there is no single being which is utterly deprived of the possession  of some power; but it has either intellectual, or rational, or sensible, or vital,  or essential power; yea even, if one may say so, self-existent being has power to  be from the superessential Power.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p8"></a>SECTION IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p9"></a>From It, are the godlike powers of the angelic ranks; from It, they have their  immutability, and all their intellectual and immortal perpetual movements; and their  equilibrium itself, and their undiminishable aspiration after good, they have received  from the Power boundless in goodness; since It commits to them the power to be,  and to be such, and to aspire always to be, and the power itself to aspire to have  the power always.  <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_96"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p10"></a>SECTION V.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p11"></a>But the gifts of the unfailing Power pass on, both to men and living creatures,  and plants, and the entire nature of the universe; and It empowers things united  for their mutual friendship and communion, and things divided for their being each  within their own sphere and limit, without confusion, and without mingling; and  preserves the order and good relations of the whole, for their own proper good,  and guards the undying lives of the individual angels inviolate; and the heavenly  and the life-giving and astral bodies <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a>
   and orders without change: and makes the period of time possible to be; and disperses  the revolutions of time by their progressions, and collects them together by their  returns; and makes the powers of fire unquenchable, and the rills of water unfailing;  and sets bounds to the aerial current, and establishes the earth upon nothing; and  guards its life-giving throes from perishing; and preserves the mutual harmony and  mingling of the elements without confusion, and without division; and holds together  the bond of soul and body; and arouses the nourishing and growing powers of plants;  and sustains the essential powers of the whole; and secures the continuance of the  universe without dissolution, and bequeaths the deification Itself, by furnishing  a power for this to those who are being deified. And in a word, there is absolutely  no single thing which is deprived of  <a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_97"></a> the overruling surety and embrace of the Divine Power. For that which  absolutely has no power, neither is, nor is anything, nor is there any sort of position  of it whatever.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p12"></a>SECTION VI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p13"></a>Yet Elymas, the Magician, says, "if Almighty God is All-powerful, how is He said  by your theologian, not to be able to do some thing "? But he calumniates the Divine  Paul, who said, "that Almighty God is not able to deny Himself." Now in advancing  this, I very much fear lest I should incur ridicule for folly, as undertaking to  pull down frail houses, built upon the sand by little boys at play; and as being  eager to aim at the theological intelligence of this, as if it were some inaccessible  mark. For, the denial of Himself, is a falling from truth, but the truth is an existent,  and the falling from the truth is a falling from the existent. If, then, the truth  is an existent, and the denial of the truth a falling from the existent, Almighty  God cannot fall from the existent, and non-existence is not; as any one might say,  the powerless is not powerful; and ignorance, by privation, does not know. The wise  man, not having understood this, imitates those inexperienced wrestlers, who, very  often, by assuming that their adversaries are weak, according to their own opinion,  and manfully making a show of fight with them, when absent, and courageously beating  the air with empty blows, think that they have overcome their antagonists, and proclaim  themselves  <a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_98"></a> victors (though) not yet having experienced their rivals’ strength.  But we, conjecturing the meaning of the Theologian to the best of our ability, celebrate  the Super-powerful God, as Omnipotent, as blessed, and only Lord; as reigning in  the kingdom of Eternity itself; as in no respect fallen from things existing;--but  rather, as both super-having and pre-having all existing things, as beseems Power  superessential; and as having bequeathed to all things being, the power to be,  and this their being in an ungrudging stream, as beseems abundance of surpassing  power.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p14"></a>SECTION VII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p15"></a>But further, Almighty God is celebrated as justice, as distributing things suitable  to all, both due measure, and beauty, and good order, and arrangement, and marking  out all distributions and orders for each, according to that which truly is the  most just limit, and as being Cause for all of the free action of each. For the  Divine Justice arranges and disposes all things, and preserving all things unmingled  and unconfused, from all, gives to all existing beings things convenient for each,  according to the due falling to each existing thing. And, if we speak correctly,  all those who abuse the Divine Justice, unconsciously convict themselves of a manifest  injustice. For they say, that immortality ought to be in mortals, and perfection  in the imperfect, and imposed necessity in the free, and  <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_99"></a> identity in the variable, and perfect power in the weak, and the temporal  should be eternal, and things moveable by nature, unchangeable, and that temporary  pleasures should be eternal; and in one word, they assign the properties of one  thing to another. They ought to know that the Divine Justice in this respect is  really a true justice, because it distributes to all the things proper to themselves,  according to the fitness of each existing thing, and preserves the nature of each  in its own order and capacity.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p16"></a>SECTION VIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p17"></a>But some one may say, it is not the mark of justice to leave pious men without  assistance, when they are ground down by evil men. To which we must reply, that,  if those whom you call pious do indeed love things on earth, which are zealously  sought after by the earthly, they have altogether fallen from the Divine Love. And  I do not know how they could be called pious, when they unjustly treat things truly  loveable and divine, which do not at once surpass in influence in their estimation  things undesirable and unloveable. But, if they love the realities, they who desire  certain things ought to rejoice when they attain the things desired. Are they not  then nearer the angelic virtues, when, as far as possible, by aspiration after things  Divine, they withdraw from the affection for earthly things, by being exercised  very manfully to this, in their perils, on behalf of the beautiful? So that, it  is true  <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_100"></a> to say, that this is rather a property of the Divine Justice--not  to pamper and destroy the bravery of the best, by the gifts of earthly things, nor,  if any one should attempt to do this, to leave them without assistance, but to establish  them in the excellent and harsh condition, and to dispense to them, as being such,  things meet for them.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p18"></a>SECTION IX.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-p19"></a>This Divine Justice, then, is celebrated also even as preservation of the whole,  as preserving and guarding the essence and order of each, distinct and pure from  the rest; and as being genuine cause of each minding its own business in the whole.  But, if any one should also celebrate this preservation, as rescuing savingly the  whole from the worse, we will entirely accept this as the <i>cantique </i>of the  manifold preservation, and we will deem him worthy to define this even as the principal  preservation of the whole, which preserves all things in themselves, without change,  undisturbed and unswaying to the worse; and guards all things without strife and  without war, each being regulated by their own methods; and excludes all inequality  and minding others’ business, from the whole; and maintains the relations of each  from falling to things contrary, and from migrating. And since, without missing  the mark of the sacred theology, one might celebrate this preservation as redeeming  all things existing, by the goodness which is preservative of all, from falling  away from their own proper goods, so far  <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_101"></a> as the nature of each of those who are being preserved admits; wherefore  also the Theologians name it redemption, both so far as it does not permit things  really being to fall away to non-existence, and so far as, if anything should have  been led astray to discord and disorder, and should suffer any diminution of the  perfection of its own proper goods, even this it redeems from passion and listlessness  and loss; supplying what is deficient, and paternally overlooking the slackness,  and raising up from evil; yea, rather, establishing in the good, and filling -up  the leaking good, and arranging and adorning its disorder and deformity, and making  it complete, and liberating it from all its blemishes. But let this suffice concerning  these matters, and concerning Justice, in accordance with which the equality of  all is measured and defined, and every inequality, which arises from deprivation  of the equality, in each thing severally, is excluded. For, if any one should interpret  inequality as distinctions in the whole, of the whole, in relation to the whole,  Justice guards even this, not permitting the whole, when they have become mingled  throughout, to be thrown into confusion, but keeping all existing things within  each particular kind, in which each was intended by nature, to be.  <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.viii-Page_102"></a></p>
