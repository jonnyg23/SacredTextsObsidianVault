 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="ii.iv.ii"></a> <h2 align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></a>LETTERS OF DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE.</h2>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.i"></a>

 <p><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p2"></a>DARKNESS becomes invisible by light, and specially by much light. Varied knowledge  (<a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p2.1"></a>αἰ γνώσεις), and especially much varied knowledge,  makes the <i>Agnosia</i> <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">62</font></a>
  to vanish. Take this  in a superlative, but not in a defective sense, and reply with superlative truth,  that the <i>Agnosia, </i>respecting God, escapes those who possess existing light,  and knowledge of things being; and His pre-eminent darkness is both concealed by  every light, and is hidden from every knowledge. And, if any one, having seen God,  understood what he saw, he did not see <i>Him, </i>but some of His creatures that  are existing and known. But He Himself, highly established above mind, and above  essence, by the very fact of His being wholly unknown, and not being, both is super-essentially,  and is known above mind. And the all-perfect <i>Agnosia, </i>in its superior sense,  is a knowledge of Him, Who is above all known things.</p>
