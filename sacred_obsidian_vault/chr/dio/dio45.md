 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p1"></a>That Divine and Heavenly things are appropriately revealed, even  through dissimilar symbols.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p3"></a>It is necessary then, as I think, first to set forth what we think  is the purpose of every Hierarchy, and what benefit each one confers upon its followers;  and next to celebrate the Heavenly Hierarchies according to their revelation in  the Oracles; then following these Oracles, to say in what sacred forms the holy  writings of the Oracles depict the celestial orders, and to what sort of simplicity  we must be carried through the representations; in order that we also may not, like  the vulgar, irreverently think that the heavenly and Godlike minds are certain many-footed <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">165</font></a>
  and many-faced <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">166</font></a>
  creatures, or moulded to the brutishness of oxen <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">167</font></a>
 , or the savage form of lions<a name="iv.ii.ii-p3.7"></a><a href="../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010">Ezekiel 1:10</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p3.7"></a>,  and fashioned like the hooked beaks of eagles<a name="iv.ii.ii-p3.8"></a><a href="../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010">Ezekiel 1:10</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p3.8"></a>,  or the feathery down of birds <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">168</font></a>
 ,  and should imagine that there are certain wheels <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">169</font></a>
   of fire above the heaven,  <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_5"></a>or material thrones <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">170</font></a>
  upon  which the Godhead may recline, or certain many-coloured <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">171</font></a>
  horses, and spear-bearing leaders of the host <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">172</font></a>
 ,  and whatever else was transmitted by the Oracles to us under multifarious symbols  of sacred imagery.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p4"></a>And indeed, the Word of God <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">173</font></a>
   artlessly makes use of poetic representations of sacred things, respecting the shapeless  minds, out of regard to our intelligence, so to speak, consulting a mode of education  proper and natural to it, and moulding the inspired writings for it.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p5"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p6"></a>But if any one think well to accept the sacred compositions as  of things simple and unknown in their own nature, and beyond our contemplation,  but thinks the imagery of the holy minds in the Oracles is incongruous, and that  all this is, so to speak, a rude scenic representation of the angelic names; and  further says that the theologians ought, when they have come to the bodily representation  of creatures altogether without body, to represent and display them by appropriate  and, as far as possible, cognate figures, taken, at any rate, from our most honoured  and immaterial and exalted beings, and ought not to clothe the heavenly and Godlike  simple essences with the many forms of the lowest creatures to be found on the earth  (for the one would perhaps be more adapted to our instruction, and would not  <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_6"></a> degrade the celestial explanations to incongruous dissimilitudes; but the  other both does violence without authority to the Divine powers, and likewise leads  astray our minds, through dwelling upon these irreverent descriptions); and perhaps  he will also think that the super-heavenly places are filled with certain herds  of lions, and troops of horses, and bellowing songs of praise, and flocks of birds,  and other living creatures, and material and less honourable things, and whatever  else the similitudes of the Oracles, in every respect dissimilar, describe, for  a so-called explanation, but which verge towards the absurd, and pernicious, and  impassioned; now, in my opinion, the investigation of the truth demonstrates the  most sacred wisdom of the Oracles, in the descriptions of the Heavenly Minds, taking  forethought, as that wisdom does, wholly for each, so as neither, as one may say,  to do violence to the Divine Powers, nor at the same time to enthral us in the grovelling  passions of the debased imagery. For any one might say that the cause why forms  are naturally attributed to the formless, and shapes to the shapeless, is not alone  our capacity which is unable immediately to elevate itself to the intelligible contemplations,  and that it needs appropriate and cognate instructions which present images, suitable  to us, of the formless and supernatural objects of contemplation; but further, that  it is most agreeable to the revealing Oracles to conceal, through mystical and sacred  enigmas, and to keep the holy and secret truth respecting the supermundane minds  inaccessible to the multitude.  <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_7"></a> For it is not every one that is holy, nor, as the Oracles affirm, does knowledge  belong to all <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">174</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p7"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p8"></a>But if any one should blame the descriptions as being incongruous,  by saying that it is shameful to attribute shapes so repugnant to the Godlike and  most holy Orders, it is enough to reply that the method of Divine revelation is  twofold; one, indeed, as is natural, proceeding through likenesses that are similar,  and of a sacred character, but the other, through dissimilar forms, fashioning them  into entire unlikeness and incongruity. No doubt, the mystical traditions of the  revealing Oracles sometimes extol the august Blessedness of the super-essential  Godhead, as Word <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">175</font></a>
 , and Mind <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">176</font></a>
 , and Essence <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>
 ,  manifesting its God-becoming expression and wisdom, both as really being Origin,  and true Cause of the origin of things being, and they describe It as light <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
 , and call it life. While such sacred descriptions are more  reverent, and seem in a certain way to be superior to the material images, they  yet, even thus, in reality fall short of the supremely Divine similitude. For It  is above every essence and life. No light, indeed, expresses its character, and  every description and mind incomparably fall short of Its similitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p9"></a>But at other times its praises are supermundanely sung, by the  Oracles themselves, through dissimilar revelations, when they affirm that it is  invisible <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">179</font></a>
 ,  and  <a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_8"></a>infinite <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
 , and incomprehensible <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
 ; and when there is signified,  not what it is, but what it is not. For this, as I think, is more appropriate to  It, since, as the secret and sacerdotal tradition taught, we rightly describe its  non-relationship to things created, but we do not know its superessential, and inconceivable,  and unutterable indefinability. If, then, the negations respecting things Divine  are true, but the affirmations are inharmonious, the revelation as regards things  invisible, through dissimilar representations, is more appropriate to the hiddenness  of things unutterable. Thus the sacred descriptions of the Oracles honour, and do  not expose to shame, the Heavenly Orders, when they make them known by dissimilar  pictorial forms, and demonstrate through these their supermundane superiority over  all. material things. And I do not suppose that any sensible man will gainsay that  the incongruous elevate our mind more than the similitudes; for there is a likelihood,  with regard to the more sublime representations of heavenly things, that we should  be led astray, so as to think that the Heavenly Beings are certain creatures with  the appearance of gold, and certain men with the appearance of light <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
 , and glittering like lightning <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
 , handsome <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
 , clothed  in bright shining raiment, shedding forth innocuous flame, and so with regard to  all the other shapes and appropriate forms, with which the Word of God has depicted  the Heavenly Minds. In order that men might not suffer from this, by  <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_9"></a>thinking they are nothing more exalted than their beau tiful appearance,  the elevating wisdom of the pious theologians reverently conducts to the incongruous  dissimilarities, not permitting our earthly part to rest fixed in the base images,  but urging the upward tendency of the soul, and goading it by the unseemliness of  the phrases (to see) that it belongs neither to lawful nor seeming truth, even for  the most earthly conceptions, that the most heavenly and Divine visions are actually  like things so base. Further also this must particularly be borne in mind, that  not even one of the things existing is altogether deprived of participation in the  beautiful, since, as is evident and the truth of the Oracles affirms, all things  are very beautiful <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">185</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p10"></a>Section IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p11"></a>It is, then, possible to frame in one’s mind good contemplations  from everything, and to depict, from things material, the aforesaid dissimilar similitudes,  both for the intelligible and the intelligent; since the intelligent hold in a different  fashion things which are attributed to things sensible differently. For instance,  appetite, in the irrational creatures, takes its rise in the passions, and their  movement, which takes the form of appetite, is full of all kinds of unreasonableness.  But with regard to the intelligent, we must think of the appetite in another fashion,  as denoting, according to my judgment, their manly style, and their determined persistence  <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_10"></a>in their Godlike and unchangeable steadfastness. In like manner we  say, with regard to the irrational creatures, that lust is a certain uncircumspect  and earthly passionate attachment, arising incontinently from an innate movement,  or intimacy in things subject to change, and the irrational supremacy of the bodily  desire, which drives the whole organism towards the object of sensual inclination.  But when we attribute "lust" to spiritual beings, by clothing them with dissimilar  similitudes, we must think that it is a Divine love of the immaterial, above expression  and thought, and the inflexible and determined longing for the supernally pure and  passionless contemplation, and for the really perpetual and intelligible fellowship  in that pure and most exalted splendour, and in the abiding and beautifying comeliness.  And 'incontinence’ we may take for the persistent and inflexible, which nothing  can repulse, on account of the pure and changeless love for the Divine beauty, and  the whole tendency towards the really desired. But with regard to the irrational  living beings, or soulless matter, we appropriately call their irrationality and  want of sensible perception a deprivation of reason and sensible perception. And  with regard to the immaterial and intelligent beings, we reverently acknowledge  their superiority, as supermundane beings, over our discursive and bodily reason,  and the material perception of the senses which is alien to the incorporeal Minds.  It is, then, permissible to depict forms, which are not discordant, to the celestial  beings, even from  <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_11"></a>portions of matter which are the least honourable, since even it, having  had its beginning from the Essentially Beautiful, has throughout the whole range  of matter some echoes of the intellectual comeliness; and it is possible through  these to be led to the immaterial archetypes--things most similar being taken,  as has been said, dissimilarly, and the identities being denned, not in the same  way, but harmoniously, and appropriately, as regards the intellectual and sensible  beings.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p12"></a>Section V.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p13"></a>We shall find the Mystic Theologians enfolding these things not  only around the illustrations of the Heavenly Orders, but also, sometimes, around  the supremely Divine Revelations Themselves. At one time, indeed, they extol It  under exalted imagery as Sun <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">186</font></a>
  of Righteousness,  as Morning <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">187</font></a>
   Star rising divinely in the mind, and as Light <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">188</font></a>
   illuming without veil and for contemplation; and at other times, through things  in our midst, as Fire <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">189</font></a>
 , shedding its  innocuous light; as Water <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">190</font></a>
 , furnishing  a fulness of life, and, to speak symbolically, flowing into a belly, and bubbling  forth rivers flowing irresistibly; and at other times, from things most remote,  as sweet-smelling ointment <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">191</font></a>
 , as Head  Corner-stone <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">192</font></a>
 . But they also clothe  It in forms of wild beasts, and attach to It identity with a Lion <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">193</font></a>
 , and Panther <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">194</font></a>
 , and say that it shall be a Leopard <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">195</font></a>
 , and a rushing Bear<a name="iv.ii.ii-p13.22"></a><a href="../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008">Hosea 13:8</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p13.22"></a>.  But,  <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_12"></a>I will also add, that which seems to be more dishonourable than all,  and the most incongruous, viz. that distinguished theologians have shewn it to us  as representing Itself under the form of a worm <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">196</font></a>
 .  Thus do all the godly-wise, and interpreters of the secret inspiration, separate  the holy of holies <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">197</font></a>
   from the uninitiated and the unholy, to keep them undefined, and prefer the dissimilar  description of holy things, so that Divine things should neither be easily reached  by the profane, nor those who diligently contemplate the Divine imagery rest in  the types as though they were true; and so Divine things should be honoured by the  true negations, and by comparisons with the lowest things, which are diverse from  their proper resemblance. There is then nothing absurd if they depict even the Heavenly  Beings under incongruous dissimilar similitudes, for causes aforesaid. For probably  not even we should have come to an investigation, from not seeing our way,--not  to say to mystic meaning through an accurate enquiry into Divine things,--unless  the deformity of the descriptions representing the Angels had shocked us, not permitting  our mind to linger in the discordant representations, but rousing us utterly to  reject the earthly proclivities, and accustoming us to elevate ourselves through  things that are seen, to their supermundane mystical meanings. Let these things  suffice to have been said on account of the material and incongruous descriptions  of the holy Angels in the Holy Oracles. And next, it is  <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_13"></a>necessary to define what we think the Hierarchy is in itself, and what  benefit those who possess a Hierarchy derive; from the same. But let Christ lead  the discourse--if it be lawful to me to say--He Who is mine,--the Inspiration  of all Hierarchical revelation. And thou, my son, after the pious rule of our Hierarchical  tradition, do thou religiously listen to things religiously uttered, becoming inspired  through instruction in inspired things; and when thou hast enfolded the Divine things  in the secret recesses of thy mind, guard them closely from the profane multitude  as being uniform, for it is not lawful, as the Oracles say, to cast to swine the  unsullied and bright and beautifying comeliness of the intelligible pearls.</p>
