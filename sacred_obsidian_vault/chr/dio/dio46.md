 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.iii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT III.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p1"></a>What is Hierarchy? and what the use of Hierarchy?</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p3"></a>Hierarchy is, in my judgment, a sacred order and science and operation,  assimilated, as far as attainable, to the likeness of God, and conducted to the  illuminations granted to it from God, according to capacity, with a view to the  Divine imitation. Now the God-becoming Beauty, as simple, as good, as source of  initiation, is altogether free from any dissimilarity, and imparts its own proper  light to each according to their fitness, and perfects in most Divine initiation,  as becomes the undeviating moulding of those who are being initiated harmoniously  to itself.  <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iii-Page_14"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p5"></a>The purpose, then, of Hierarchy is the assimilation and union,  as far as attainable, with God, having Him Leader of all religious science and operation,  by looking unflinchingly to His most Divine comeliness, and copying, as far as possible,  and by perfecting its own followers as Divine images, mirrors most luminous and  without flaw, receptive of the primal light and the supremely Divine ray, and devoutly  filled with the entrusted radiance, and again, spreading this radiance ungrudgingly  to those after it, in accordance with the supremely Divine regulations. For it is  not lawful for the Mystic Rites of sacred things, or for things religiously done,  to practise anything whatever beyond the sacred regulations of their own proper  function. Nor even must they attempt otherwise, if they desire to attain its deifying  splendour, and look to it religiously, and are moulded after the example of each  of the holy minds. He, then, who mentions Hierarchy, denotes a certain altogether  Holy Order, an image of the supremely Divine freshness, ministering the mysteries  of its own illumination in hierarchical ranks, and sciences, and assimilated to  its own proper Head as far as lawful.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p6"></a>For each of those who have been called into the Hierarchy, find  their perfection in being carried to the Divine imitation <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">198</font></a>
  in their own proper degree; and, what is more Divine than all,  in becoming a  <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iii-Page_15"></a>fellow-worker <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">199</font></a>
   with God, as the Oracles say, and in shewing the Divine energy in himself manifested  as far as possible. For it is an Hierarchical regulation that some are purified  and that others purify <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">200</font></a>
 ; that some are  enlightened and others enlighten <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">201</font></a>
 ; that some are perfected and others perfect; the Divine imitation  will fit each one in this fashion. The Divine blessedness, to speak after the manner  of men, is indeed unstained by any dissimilarity <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">202</font></a>
 ,  and is full of invisible light <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">203</font></a>
 --perfect <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">204</font></a>
 , and needing no perfection; cleansing, illuminating, and  perfecting, yea, rather a holy purification, and illumination, and perfection--above  purification, above light, preeminently perfect, self-perfect source and cause of  every Hierarchy, and elevated pre-eminently above every holy thing.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p7"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p8"></a>It is necessary then, as I think, that those who are being purified  should be entirely perfected, without stain, and be freed from all dissimilar confusion;  that those who are being illuminated should be filled with the Divine Light, conducted  to the habit and faculty of contemplation in all purity of mind; that those who  are being initiated should be separated from the imperfect, and become recipients  of that perfecting science of the sacred things contemplated. Further, that those  who purify should impart, from their own abundance of purity, their own proper holiness;  that those who illuminate, as being more  <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iii-Page_16"></a>luminous intelligences, whose function it is to- receive and to impart  light, and who are joyfully filled with holy gladness, that these should overflow,  in proportion to their own overflowing light, towards those who are worthy of enlightenment; and that those who make perfect, as being skilled in the impartation of perfection,  should perfect those being perfected, through the holy instruction, in the science  of the holy things contemplated. Thus each rank of the Hierarchical Order is led,  in its own degree, to the Divine co-operation, by performing, through grace and  God-given power, those things which are naturally and supernaturally in the Godhead,  and accomplished by It superessentially, and manifested hierarchically, for the  attainable imitation of the God-loving Minds <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">205</font></a>
