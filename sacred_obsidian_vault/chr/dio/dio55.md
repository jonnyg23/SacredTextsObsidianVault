 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.xii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT XII.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p1"></a>Why the Hierarchs amongst men are called Angels.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xii-p3"></a>But this is sometimes also asked by diligent contemplators of  the intelligible Oracles; Inasmuch as the lowest Orders do not possess the completeness  of the superior, for what reason is our Hierarch named by the Oracles, "Angel of  the Sovereign Lord?"</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xii-p5"></a>Now the statement, as I think, is not contrary to what has been  before defined; for we say that the last lack the complete and pre-eminent Power  of the more reverend Divisions; for they participate in the partial and analogous,  according to the one harmonious and binding fellowship of all things. For example,  the rank of the holy Cherubim participates in higher wisdom and knowledge, but the  Divisions of the Beings beneath them, participate, they also, in wisdom and knowledge,  but nevertheless partially, as compared with them, and  <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xii-Page_45"></a> in a lower degree. For the participation of wisdom and knowledge throughout  is common to all the minds which bear the image of God; but the being near and first,  or second and inferior, is not common, but, as has been determined for each in its  own degree. This also one might safely define respecting all the Divine Minds; for, as the first possess abundantly the saintly characteristics of the inferior,  so the last possess those of the superior, not indeed in the same degree, but subordinately.  There is, then, as I think, nothing absurd, if the Word of God calls our Hierarch,  Angel, since he participates, according to his own capacity, in the messenger characteristic  of the Angels, and elevates himself, as far as attainable to men, to the likeness  of their revealing office.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p6"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xii-p7"></a>But you will find that the Word of God calls gods, both the Heavenly  Beings above us, and the most beloved of God, and holy men amongst us, although  the Divine Hiddenness is transcendently elevated and established above all, and  no created Being can. properly and wholly be said to be like unto It, except those  intellectual and rational Beings who are entirely and wholly turned to Its Oneness  as far as possible, and who elevate themselves incessantly to Its Divine illuminations,  as far as attainable, by their imitation of God, if I may so speak, according to  their power, and are deemed worthy of the same divine name.  <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xii-Page_46"></a></p>
