 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.v-p2"></a>ON the other hand, ascending, we say, that It is neither soul, nor mind, nor  has imagination, or opinion, or reason, or conception; neither is    <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.ii.v-Page_137"></a>expressed, nor conceived; neither is number, nor order, nor greatness, nor littleness; nor  equality, nor inequality; nor similarity, nor dissimilarity; neither is standing,  nor moving; nor at rest; neither has power, nor is power, nor light; neither lives,  nor is life; neither is essence nor eternity, nor time; neither is Its touch intelligible,  neither is It science, nor truth; nor kingdom, nor wisdom; neither one, nor oneness;  neither Deity, nor Goodness; nor is It Spirit according to our understanding; nor  Sonship, nor Paternity; nor any other thing of those known to us, or to any other  existing being; neither is It any of non-existing nor of existing things, nor do  things existing know It, as It is; nor does It know existing things, <i>qua </i> existing; neither is there expression of It, nor name, nor knowledge; neither is  It darkness, nor light; nor error, nor truth; neither is there any definition at  all of It, nor any abstraction. But when making the predications and abstractions  of things after It, we neither predicate, nor abstract from It; since the all-perfect  and uniform Cause of all is both above every definition and the pre-eminence of  Him, Who is absolutely freed from all, and beyond the whole, is also above every  abstraction.</p>
