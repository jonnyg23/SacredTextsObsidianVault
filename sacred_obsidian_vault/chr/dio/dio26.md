 , both above source  of Divinity and above source of Good? Provided you  <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ii-Page_142"></a> understand Deity and Goodness, as the very Actuality  of the Good-making and God-making gift, and the inimitable imitation of the super-divine  and super-good (gift), by aid of which we are deified and made good. For, moreover,  if this becomes source of the deification and making good of those who are being  deified and made good, He,--Who is super-source of every source, even of the so-called  Deity and Goodness, seeing He is beyond source of Divinity and source of Goodness,  in so far as He is inimitable, and not to be retained--excels the imitations and  retentions, and the things which are imitated and those participating.</p>
