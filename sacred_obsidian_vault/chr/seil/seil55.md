 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: To His beloved Disciples He speaks apart about the Eight Beatitudes: "`Blessed the poor of spirit, the meek, the merciful, those who weep, those who suffer hunger and thirst for justice, the clean of heart, the peaceful, and those who suffer persecution.'"
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He exhorts them to use their talents well: "`So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father Who is in the heavens.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He shows Himself not a transgressor, but a perfector of the law; explaining the precept of not killing, not committing fornication, not being guilty of perjury, and of loving enemies. "`I say to you that you love your enemies and do good to them that hate you.'"
