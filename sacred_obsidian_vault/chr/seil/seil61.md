 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Taking along His beloved Disciples, Peter, James, John, Christ our Lord was transfigured, and His face did shine as the sun, and His garments as the snow.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He was speaking with Moses and Elias.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: St. Peter saying that they would make three tabernacles, a voice from heaven sounded, which said: "`This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him!'" When His Disciples heard this voice, they fell for fear on their faces; and Christ our Lord touched them and said to them: "` Arise and fear not. Tell this vision to no one until the Son of Man be risen.'"
