The first Point: It is necessary that everything about which we want to make an election should be indifferent, or good, in itself, and should be allowed within our Holy Mother the hierarchical Church, and not bad nor opposed to her.
 <p> <b>Second Point</b>. Second: There are some things which fall under unchangeable election, such as are the priesthood, marriage, etc. There are others which fall under an election that can be changed, such as are to take benefices or leave them, to take temporal goods or rid oneself of them.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point</b>. Third: In the unchangeable Election which has already been once made -- such as marriage, the priesthood, etc. -- there is nothing more to choose, because one cannot release himself; only it is to be seen to that if one have not made his election duly and ordinately and without disordered tendencies, repenting let him see to living a good life in his election. It does not appear that this election is a Divine vocation, <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="seil83.htm#fn_14"><font size="1">15</font></a> as being an election out of order and awry. Many err in this, setting up a perverse or bad election as a Divine <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="seil83.htm#fn_15"><font size="1">16</font></a> vocation; for every Divine vocation is always pure and clear, without mixture of flesh, or of any other inordinate tendency.
 </p><p> <b>Fourth Point</b>. Fourth: If some one has duly and ordinately made election of things which are under election that can be changed, and has not yielded to flesh or world, there is no reason for his making election anew, but let him perfect himself as much as he can in that already chosen.
 </p><p> <b>Note</b>. It is to be remarked that if such election that can be changed was not made sincerely and well in order, then it helps to make the election duly, if one has a desire that fruits notable and very pleasing to God our Lord should come from him.
