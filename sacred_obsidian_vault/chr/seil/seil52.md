 <p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He called Philip, as is in the first Chapter of St. John, and Matthew as Matthew himself says in the ninth Chapter.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He called the other Apostles, of whose special call the Gospel does not make mention.
 </p><p> And three other things also would be to be considered:
 </p><p> The first, how the Apostles were of uneducated and low condition;
 </p><p> The second, the dignity to which they were so sweetly called;
 </p><p> The third, the gifts and graces by which they were raised above all the Fathers of the New and Old Testaments.
