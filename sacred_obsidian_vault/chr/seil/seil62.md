 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Martha and Mary sent word to Christ our Lord of the illness of Lazarus. Knowing it, He delayed for two days, that the miracle might be more evident.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Before He raises him, He asks the one and the other to believe, saying: "`I am the resurrection and life; he who believeth in Me, although he be dead, shall live.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He raises him, after having wept and prayed. And the manner of raising him was by commanding: "`Lazarus, come forth!'"
