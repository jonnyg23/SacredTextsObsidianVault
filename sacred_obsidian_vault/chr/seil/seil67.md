 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Supper finished, and singing the hymn, the Lord went to Mount Olivet with His Disciples, who were full of fear; and leaving the eight in Gethsemani, He said: "`Sit ye here till I go yonder to pray.'"
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Accompanied by St. Peter, St. James and St. John, He prayed three times to the Lord, saying: "`Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from Me. Nevertheless, let not My will be done, but Thine.'" And being in agony, He prayed the longer.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He came into such fear, that He said: "`My soul is sorrowful unto death,'" and He sweated blood so plentiful, that St. Luke says: "His sweat was as drops of blood which were running on the earth;" which supposes that the garments were already full of blood.
