 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: He spoke seven words on the Cross: He prayed for those who were crucifying Him; He pardoned the thief; He recommended St. John to His Mother and His Mother to St. John; He said with a loud voice: "`I thirst,'" and they gave Him gall and vinegar; He said that He was abandoned; He said: "It is consummated"; He said: "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit!"
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: The sun was darkened, the stones broken, the graves opened, the veil of the Temple was rent in two from above below. <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="seil83.htm#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: They blaspheme Him, saying: "`Thou wert He who destroyest the Temple of God; come down from the Cross."` His garments were divided; His side, struck with the lance, sent forth water and blood.
