 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Pilate, seated as judge, delivered Jesus to them to crucify Him, after the Jews had denied Him for king, saying: "`We have no king but Caesar!`" 
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He took the Cross on His shoulders and not being able to carry it, Simon of Cyrene was constrained to carry it after Jesus.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: They crucified Him between two thieves, setting this title: "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
