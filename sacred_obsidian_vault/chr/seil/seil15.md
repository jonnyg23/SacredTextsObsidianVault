 <p> <b>Prayer</b>. Let the Preparatory Prayer be the usual one.
 </p><p> <b>First Prelude</b>. The first Prelude is the composition, which is here to see with the sight of the imagination the length, breadth and depth of Hell.
 </p><p> <b>Second Prelude</b>. The second, to ask for what I want: it will be here to ask for interior sense of the pain which the damned suffer, in order that, if, through my faults, I should forget the love of the Eternal Lord, at least the fear of the pains may help me not to come into sin.
 </p><p> <b>First Point</b>. The first Point will be to see with the sight of the imagination the great fires, and the souls as in bodies of fire.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point</b>. The second, to hear with the ears wailings, howlings, cries, blasphemies against Christ our Lord and against all His Saints.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point</b>. The third, to smell with the smell smoke, sulphur, dregs and putrid things.
 </p><p> <b>Fourth Point</b>. The fourth, to taste with the taste bitter things, like tears, sadness and the worm of conscience.
 </p><p> <b>Fifth Point</b>. The fifth, to touch with the touch; that is to say, how the fires touch and burn the souls.
 </p><p> <b>Colloquy</b>. Making a Colloquy to Christ our Lord, I will bring to memory the souls that are in Hell, some because they did not believe the Coming, others because, believing, they did not act according to His Commandments; making three divisions:
 </p><p> <b>First, Second, and Third Divisions</b>. The first, before the Coming; the second, during His life; the third, after His life in this world; and with this I will give Him thanks that He has not let me fall into any of these divisions, ending my life.
 </p><p> Likewise, I will consider how up to now He has always had so great pity and mercy on me.
 </p><p> I will end with an OUR FATHER.
 </p><p> <b>Note</b>. The first Exercise will be made at midnight; the second immediately on rising in the morning; the third, before or after Mass; in any case, before dinner; the fourth at the hour of Vespers; the fifth, an hour before supper.
 </p><p> This arrangement of hours, more or less, I always mean in all the four Weeks, according as his age, disposition and physical condition help the person who is exercising himself to make five Exercises or fewer.
 </p><p>  </p><h3 align="center">ADDITIONS</h3> <h5 align="center">TO MAKE THE EXERCISES BETTER AND TO FIND BETTER WHAT ONE DESIRES</h5> <b>First Addition</b>. The first Addition is, after going to bed, just when I want to go asleep, to think, for the space of a HAIL MARY, of the hour that I have to rise and for what, making a resume of the Exercise which I have to make.
 <p> <b>Second Addition</b>. The second: When I wake up, not giving place to any other thought, to turn my attention immediately to what I am going to contemplate in the first Exercise, at midnight, bringing myself to confusion for my so many sins, setting examples, as, for instance, if a knight found himself before his king and all his court, ashamed and confused at having much offended him, from whom he had first received many gifts and many favors: in the same way, in the second Exercise, making myself a great sinner and in chains; that is to say going to appear bound as in chains before the Supreme Eternal Judge; taking for an example how prisoners in chains and already deserving death, appear before their temporal judge. And I will dress with these thoughts or with others, according to the subject matter.
 </p><p> <b>Third Addition</b>. The third: A step or two before the place where I have to contemplate or meditate, I will put myself standing for the space of an OUR FATHER, my intellect raised on high, considering how God our Lord is looking at me, etc.; and will make an act of reverence or humility.
 </p><p> <b>Fourth Addition</b>. The fourth: To enter on the contemplation now on my knees, now prostrate on the earth, now lying face upwards, now seated, now standing, always intent on seeking what I want.
 </p><p> We will attend to two things. The first is, that if I find what I want kneeling, I will not pass on; and if prostrate, likewise, etc. The second; in the Point in which I find what I want, there I will rest, without being anxious to pass on, until I content myself.
 </p><p> <b>Fifth Addition</b>. The fifth: After finishing the Exercise, I will, during the space of a quarter of an hour, seated or walking leisurely, look how it went with me in the Contemplation or Meditation; and if badly, I will look for the cause from which it proceeds, and having so seen it, will be sorry, in order to correct myself in future; and if well, I will give thanks to God our Lord, and will do in like manner another time.
 </p><p> <b>Sixth Addition</b>. The sixth: Not to want to think on things of pleasure or joy, such as heavenly glory, the Resurrection, etc. Because whatever consideration of joy and gladness hinders our feeling pain and grief and shedding tears for our sins: but to keep before me that I want to grieve and feel pain, bringing to memory rather Death and Judgment.
 </p><p> <b>Seventh Addition</b>. The seventh: For the same end, to deprive myself of all light, closing the blinds and doors while I am in the room, if it be not to recite prayers, to read and eat.
 </p><p> <b>Eighth Addition</b>. The eighth: Not to laugh nor say a thing provocative of laughter.
 </p><p> <b>Ninth Addition</b>. The ninth: To restrain my sight, except in receiving or dismissing the person with whom I have spoken.
 </p><p> <b>Tenth Addition</b>. The tenth Addition is penance.
 </p><p> This is divided into interior and exterior. The interior is to grieve for one's sins, with a firm purpose of not committing them nor any others. The exterior, or fruit of the first, is chastisement for the sins committed, and is chiefly taken in three ways.
 </p><p> <b>First Way</b>. The first is as to eating. That is to say, when we leave off the superfluous, it is not penance, but temperance. It is penance when we leave off from the suitable; and the more and more, the greater and better -- provided that the person does not injure himself, and that no notable illness follows.
 </p><p> <b>Second Way</b>. The second, as to the manner of sleeping. Here too it is not penance to leave off the superfluous of delicate or soft things, but it is penance when one leaves off from the suitable in the manner: and the more and more, the better -- provided that the person does not injure himself and no notable illness follows. Besides, let not anything of the suitable sleep be left off, unless in order to come to the mean, if one has a bad habit of sleeping too much.
 </p><p> <b>Third Way</b>. The third, to chastise the flesh, that is, giving it sensible pain, which is given by wearing haircloth or cords or iron chains next to the flesh, by scourging or wounding oneself, and by other kinds of austerity.
 </p><p> <b>Note. </b>What appears most suitable and most secure with regard to penance is that the pain should be sensible in the flesh and not enter within the bones, so that it give pain and not illness. For this it appears to be more suitable to scourge oneself with thin cords, which give pain exteriorly, rather than in another way which would cause notable illness within.
 </p><p> <b>First Note</b>. The first Note is that the exterior penances are done chiefly for three ends: First, as satisfaction for the sins committed; 
 </p><p> Second, to conquer oneself -- that is, to make sensuality obey reason and all inferior parts be more subject to the superior;
 </p><p> Third, to seek and find some grace or gift which the person wants and desires; as, for instance, if he desires to have interior contrition for his sins, or to weep much over them, or over the pains and sufferings which Christ our Lord suffered in His Passion, or to settle some doubt in which the person finds himself.
 </p><p> <b>Second Note</b>. The second: It is to be noted that the first and second Addition have to be made for the Exercises of midnight and at daybreak, but not for those which will be made at other times; and the fourth Addition will never be made in church in the presence of others, but in private, as at home, etc.
 </p><p> <b>Third Note. </b>The third: When the person who is exercising himself does not yet find what he desires -- as tears, consolations, etc., -- it often helps for him to make a change in food, in sleep and in other ways of doing penance, so that he change himself, doing penance two or three days, and two or three others not. For it suits some to do more penance and others less, and we often omit doing penance from sensual love and from an erroneous judgment that the human system will not be able to bear it without notable illness; and sometimes, on the contrary, we do too much, thinking that the body can bear it; and as God our Lord knows our nature infinitely better, often in such changes He gives each one to perceive what is suitable for him.
 </p><p> <b>Fourth Note</b>. The fourth: Let the Particular Examen be made to rid oneself of defects and negligences on the Exercises and Additions. And so in the SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH WEEKS.
