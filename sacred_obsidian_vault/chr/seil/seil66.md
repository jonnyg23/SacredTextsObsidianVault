 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: He ate the Paschal Lamb with His twelve Apostles, to whom He foretold His death. "`In truth, I say to you that one of you is to sell Me.'"
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He washed the Disciples' feet, even those of Judas, commencing from St. Peter, who, considering the Majesty of the Lord and his own baseness, not wanting to consent, said: "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?" But St. Peter did not know that in that He gave an example of humility, and for this He said: "`I have given you an example, that you may do as I did.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He instituted the most sacred sacrifice of the Eucharist, to be the greatest mark of His love, saying: "`Take and eat.'" The Supper finished, Judas went forth to sell Christ our Lord.
