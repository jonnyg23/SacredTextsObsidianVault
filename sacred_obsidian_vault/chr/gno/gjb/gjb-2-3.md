 <h3 align="center">III.—SOME TYPICAL EXTRACTS.</h3>
 
 <p>UNDER the first two headings readers have been made acquainted with all those pieces from the Mandæan John-Book that can be held to have in any sense a historic intention. To these are now added a few extracts of such specimens of the rest of the contents as do not require a commentary.</p>
 
 <p>   We will begin with 'The Fisher of Souls' tractate from the John-Book. It seems to me to throw great light on the symbolic phrase of the gospels, indeed to give it a background, and not to be explained in reverse order as the Mandæan expansion of an isolated Christian expression.</p>

 <p align="center">THE FISHER OF SOULS SAGA (§§ 36-39)<a name="page_71_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_71_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.</p>

 <p>   A FISHER am I, a Fisher who elect is among fishers. A Fisher am I who among the fishers is chosen, the Head of all catchers of fish. I know the shallows of the waters, the inner . . . and the . . . I fathom; I come to the net-grounds, to the shallows and all fishing-spots, and search the marsh in the dark all over. My boat is not cut off [from the others] and I shall not be stopped in the night.</p>
 
 <p>   I see the fish<a name="page_71_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_71_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> in (? on) the dike. I pressed forward on the way with a . . . that was not of iron. I covered (?) the . . . which was for us an obstruction. Aside did I push the swimmers

 who hinder Life's way. On my head I set up a . . . in whose shadow the fish sit. The fisher-trident which I have in my hand, is instead a <i>margnā</i> select, a staff of pure water, at whose sight tremble the fishers.</p>
 
 <p>   I sit in a boat of glory and come into this world (Tibil) of the fleeting. I come to the water's surface; thither to the surface of the water I drew, and I drew to the crossing's surface. I come in a . . . , in slow, steady course. The water by my boat is not ruffled, and no sound of my boat is heard. Before me stands Hibil (Abel), at my side Shitil (Seth) of sweet name is to be seen, close by me, close in front of me, Anōsh (Enoch) sits and proclaims.</p>
 
 <p>   They say: "O Father, Good Fisher, hallo! O Fisher of loveable name!"</p>
 
 <p>   Close by me, close near my boat, I hear the uproar (?) of the fishers, the fishers who eat fish,<a name="page_72_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_72_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and their stench rushes on me,—the uproar of the fishers and the uproar of their mongers who revile and curse one another. Everyone accuses the other. The buyer says to the fisher: "[Take back?] thy fish! They are stinking already, and no one wants to buy them off of me. Thou makest the catch far out at sea,<a name="page_72_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_72_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> so that loss falls on the buyer."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon speaks the fisher and makes the man, his customer, hear: "A curse on thee, a curse on thy buyers, a curse on thy bell,<a name="page_72_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_72_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> a curse on thy boat for not filling up. Thou hast brought no salt and sprinkled it over thy fish which thou boughtest, so that the fish of thy boat will not be stinking and thou then canst sell for hard cash. Next, hast thou no meal and no dates brought, no salt . . . hast thou brought. If then thou comest with empty hands, one who is of fair favour has no dealing with thee. Go, go, thou godless [fellow], buy not from us to do business with thy fraudulent scales. Thou holdest them down to buy at false weight, [then in selling] keepest them up with thy elbow and gettest ten for five. Now does thy buying flee away, and thy buyer, and is as though it never had been. Thou dost complain of the . . . of men and dost cherish no noble thought."</p>

 <blockquote>
 
 <p>   When the Chief Fisher, the Head of the race of the Living, the highest of all catchers of fish, heard this, he said to him (? Anōsh): "Bring me my . . . , hand me the <i>squbrā</i>,<a name="page_73_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_73_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> that I may make a call sound forth into the marsh, that I may warn the fish of the depths and scare away the foul-smelling birds that pursue after my fish. I will catch the great <i>sidmā</i>,<a name="page_73_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_73_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and tear off his wings on the spot. I will take from him * * * and will blow into my <i>squbrā</i>. A true <i>squbrā</i> is it, so that the water may not mix with pitch."</p>
 
 <p>   When the fishers heard the call, their heart fell down from its stay. One calls to the other and speaks to him: "Go into thy inner ground. For there is the call of the Fisher, the Fisher who eats no fish. His voice is not like that of a fisher, his <i>squbrā</i> not like our <i>squbrā</i>. His voice is not like our voice, his discourse not like to this world."</p>
 
 <p>   But the fishers stand there; they seek not shelter in their inner ground. As the fishers stand there and are thinking it over, the Fisher came swiftly upon them; he opened the cast-net, divided ... . He cast them bound into the ... . He tied them up with knots. They speak to him: "Free us from our bonds, so that thy fish may not leap up to our boat. We catch not those who name thy Name."</p>
 
 <p>   When the fishers thus spake to me, I smote them with a club made of iron. I bound their traders on the shore which lends not . . . (?). I roped them with ropes of bast and broke up their ships * * * * . I burnt up the whole of their netting and the . . . which holds the nets together. I threw chains round them and hung them up aft on my ship's stern. I made them take an oath, took from them their mystery, in order that they may not catch the good fish,—that they may not steal them from me, stick them on a cane, hang them up,<a name="page_73_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_73_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> I cut them in pieces and throw them into baskets (?) with laurel and aloe. They (the fishers) are laid low and cannot rise up. The nets ... ..., and they no longer stab the fisher-trident into the Jordan. They do not cut off * * * * * * and stand not in the river-lands
 
 <!------------------------page 74------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a>
 
 and make not their catch in the shallows. They cast not the cast-net therein and take not . . . and aloe.</p>
 
 <p>   I spake to those who eat the . . . of the fish whose name is eel. They eat the eel and the . . . , which stands upright on its forefeet. They eat the ... ... ... ... . I bound them in the marshes of Deception, and they were caught and were tied up. Water from the Ulai they drink not and know not the way to the Kshash river.<a name="page_74_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_74_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> I bound them fast in their ships, and threw out my ropes to the good ones. To them I speak: "Draw your boat up here, so that it runs not into the dike."</p>
 
 <p>   As the Chief of the fish-catchers thus spake, the fishers made answer unto him and said; "Blessed be thou, a Fisher, and blessed be thy boat and thy bark. How fair is thy cast-net, how fair the yarn that is in it. Fair is thy cord and thy lacing, thou who art not like the fishers of this world. On thy meshes are no shell-fish, and thy trident catches no fish. Whence art thou come hither? Tell us! We will be thy hired servants. We will bake and stir about broth and bring it before thee. Eat, and the crumbs which fall from thy hand,—these will we eat and therewith be filled."</p>
 
 <p>   But I made answer unto them: "O ye fishers, who lap up your filth, no fisher am I who fishes for fish, and I was not formed for an eater of filth. A Fisher am I of souls who bear witness to Life. A Poor Fisher am I who calls to the souls, collects them together and gives them instruction. He calls to them and bids them come and gather together unto him. He says unto them: If ye . . . come, ye shall be saved from the foul-smelling birds I will save my friends, bring them on high and in my ship make them stand upright. I will clothe them with vestures of glory and with precious light will enwrap them. I will put a crown of æther upon them and what else for them the Greatness erects on their head. Then sit they on thrones and in precious light do they glisten. I bear them thither and raise them aloft; but ye Seven shall stay here behind. The portion of filth and of filthy

 doings shall be your portion. On the day when the Light ascends, the Darkness will return to its region. I and my disciples will ascend and behold the Light's region."</p>

 <p align="center">THE LIGHT-SHIP OF THE FISHER (§ 37).</p>
 
 <p align="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</p>
 
 <p>   A FISHER am I of Great Life, a Fisher am I of the Mighty; a Fisher am I of Great Life, an Envoy whom Life has sent. It (Life) spake unto me: "Go, catch fish who do not eat filth, fish who do not eat water-fennel and reek not of foul-smelling fennel. They do not come nigh to devour bad dates and get caught in the nets of the marsh."</p>
 
 <p>   Life knotted for me a noose and built for me a ship that fades not,—a ship whose wings are of glory, that sails along as in flight, and from it the wings will not be torn off. 'Tis a well-furnished ship and sails on in the heart of the heaven. Its ropes are ropes of glory and a rudder of Truth is there to it. Sunday takes hold of the pole, Life's Son seized the rudder. They draw thither to the shekīnahs and dispense Light among the treasures. Thrones in them (<i>sc</i>. the shekīnahs) they set up, and long drawn out come the Jordans upon them. On the bow are set lamps that in the wildest of tempests are not put out. All ships that sight me, make obeisance submissively to me. Submissively they make me obeisance and come to show their devotion unto me.</p>
 
 <p>   In the bows stands the Fisher and delivers wondrous discourses. [There are] lamps [there], whose wicks shift not hither and thither, and a . . . is not by him. He wears no ring of Deception, and with white robes is he clad. He calls to the fish of the sea and speaks to them: "Give heed to yourselves in the world! Beware of the foul-smelling birds who are above you. If you give heed to yourselves my brothers, I will for you

We will make thee familiar with the fishers; be our great partner and take a share as we [do]. Grant us a share in thy ship, and take thou a share in our ship. A bargain!

Join thy ship with ours and clothe thee in black as we [do], so that, if thou holdest thy lantern on high, thou mayst find something, that the fish may not see thy glory and thy ship may take in fish. If thou dost give ear (to us), thou shalt catch fish, throw them into thy ship and do business. If thou givest no ear to our discourse, thou shalt eat salt; but if thou doest our works, thou shalt eat oil and honey. Thou stirrest a broth, thou fillest a bowl and sharest it with all of the fishers. We appoint thee as head over all of us. The fishers gather together beside thee, the first follow behind thee; they will be thy slaves, and thou takest three shares of what falls to our share. Our father shall be thy servant and we will call ourselves thy bondsmen. Our mother shall sit on thy couch (?)

She shall space out the floats of cedar and put the lead-sinkers into the meshes,—meshes, meshes which are then more heavy than all of the world. She shall divide the water by means of the yarns, and when the fish run into them they shall be stopped. Then they know not the way that they seek, and have no wit to turn back to their way. Like walls that collapse, they (the nets) come and fall on the good. They do not let the fish rise, nor turn their face to the boulders.<a name="page_77_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_77_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> They make them sink deep under the mud and shut them into ... ... ... ... .

Woe to the fish who fall into them."<a name="page_77_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_77_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a></p>
 
 <p>   When the Fisher heard this, he stamped on the bows of the ship. The Fisher stamped on the ships of the fishers; the fishers lie in the shallows close crowded together, tied up together like bundles of wheat, and cannot rise up. The reeds swish ...,<a name="page_77_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_77_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> and the fish of the sea lie over the fishers. They snarl in the marsh and the water rings them round in its circle (?).</p>
 
 <p>   Then shrilling he spake with his voice. He discoursed with his voice sublime and spake to the catchers of fish: "Off from me,

I am no Fisher who catches fish, and my fish are tested. They are not caught by the hook with bad dates, a mess which [my?] fish do not eat. They fall not into the nets that are coloured<a name="page_78_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_78_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and turn not to the lamps of the Lie.

If the fishers cast o'er them the cast-net, they tear asunder the net and set themselves free. There will be no day in this world on which the fishers catch [my?] fish. There will be no day in this world on which the dove loves the ravens. Accursèd be ye, ye foul-smelling birds, and accursèd your nest, so that it may not be filled. Woe to your father Sirmā,<a name="page_78_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_78_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> whose bed is in the reeds.

Well for him who frees himself from the talons of those who catch fish. Well for him who frees himself from the men who are watchers of this world. Begone, begone with you, ye Planets, be of your own houses a portion. Water does not mix with pitch, and the Light is not reckoned as Darkness.

 <p>   'TIS the voice of the Pure Fisher who calls and instructs the fish of the sea in the shallows. He speaks to them: "Raise your ... up, on the surface of the water stand upright; then will your force be double as great. Guard yourselves from the fishers who catch the fish and beat on the Jordan.<a name="page_79_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_79_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> Shilmai and Nidbai<a name="page_79_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_79_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> curse them, and they depart and settle themselves down behind me a mile off. The fish curse their casting-net in their place."</p>
 
 <p>   When the Fisher thus spake, warning all [of the fish, when] the fishers his voice heard, they came up and gathered around him. They put themselves forward to ask of him questions, and knew not whence he came. "Where wast thou, Fisher," they ask him, "that we heard not thy voice in the marsh? Thy ship is not like our ship, and thy ... is not * * * * * *. Thy ship is not tarred over with pitch, and thou art not like the fishers of this world."</p>
 
 <p>   The fishers see him, become scarlet for shame and remain standing in their places. They say to him: "Whence comes it

 <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a>
 
 that thou dost fish without finding? Thy ship is not like our ship; it shines by night like the sun. Thy ship is perfected in æther, and wondrous standards are unfurled above it. Our ship sails along in the water, but thy ship between the waters. Our reeds (? rods) grumble at one another and break into pieces. Among them is the fish-trident of wrath, on which ... and ... ... are not. Thy ... ... O Fisher, is such that when the fish see it, they take themselves off.

There are no ... in it, which are a cunning device against the fish of the ... ... ... . Thou keepest thy yarn and hast no clapper and no hatchet. Thy yarn ( = net) fishes not in the water and is not coloured for catching fish."</p>
 
 <p>   When the fishers thus spake, the Fisher made answer unto them: "Have done, ye fishers and fishers' sons; off, get you gone from me! Off, go up to your village, the Ruins, Jerusalem. Ask about me of your father, who knows me, ask of your mother, who is my maid-servant. Say to him: There is a Fisher in the boat, in which are four ... .

They lay waste the land of Jerusalem."</p>
 
 <p>   When they heard this from the Fisher who has come hither, and understood, they spake to him: "Have compassion, forbearance and mercy on us and forgive us our sins and transgressions. We are thy slaves, show thyself indulgent towards us. We will look after thy fish that none of them fails. We will be the servants of thy disciples, who name thy Name in Truth. We will continue to look after all who name thy Name."</p>

 <p align="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</p>
 
 <p>   A SHEPHERD am I who loves his sheep; sheep and lambs I watch over. Round my neck [I carry] the sheep; and the sheep from the hamlet stray not. I carry them not to the sea-shore, that they see not the whirl of the water, may not be afraid of the water, and if they are thirsty may not drink of the water.<a name="page_81_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_81_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> I bear them away [from the sea], and water them with the cup of my hand, until they have drunken their fill.

From the mouth of Euphrates, from the mouth of Euphrates the Radiant,<a name="page_81_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_81_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> things of marvellous goodness I brought them. I brought them myrtle, white sesame brought them and brought them bright standards.<a name="page_81_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_81_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> I cleansed them and washed them and made them to smell the sweet odour of Life. I put round them a girdle, at sight of which the wolves tremble. No wolf leaps into our fold; and of no fierce lion need they be alarmed.

A thief breaks not into their fold; and of a knife<a name="page_81_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_81_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> they need not be anxious. When my sheep were quietly laid down and my head lay there on the threshold, a rift was rent in the height and thunder did thunder behind me. The clouds seized hold one of another,

 and unchained were the raging tempests. Rain poured down in sheets and hail that smites elephants low, hail that shatters the mountains. And the tempests unchain themselves in an hour.<a name="page_82_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_82_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> Seas burst forth; they flooded the whole of the world. There, under the water, no one escaped, once he sank from the height as into a gulf. The water swept off everyone who had no wings or no feet.<a name="page_82_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_82_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> He speeds on, and knows not he speeds; he goes, and knows not he goes. Thereupon I sprang up and I entered the fold to bear my sheep forth from their place. I saw my eyes full.<a name="page_82_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_82_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> I saw the sea, I saw the fierce-raging tempest, I saw the storm-clouds that send forth no [friendly] greeting the one to the other. Ten-thousand times ten-thousand dragons are in each single cloud. I weep for my sheep, and my sheep weep for themselves. The little lambs are lamenting who cannot come out of the fold's door.</p>
 
 <p>   When then * * * * * *, I entered the house,<a name="page_82_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_82_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> I mounted up to the highest place [in it], and I call to my sheep. To the sheep in my care do I call. I pipe to them; I get them to hear, so that they come unto me. To them I pipe on my pipe, and beat on my tabour (?), [leading them] to the water.<a name="page_82_fr_5"></a><a href="#page_82_note_5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a> I call to them: "My little sheep, little sheep, come! Rise up at my call! Come, rise at my call; then will you 'scape the cloud-dragons. Come, come unto me! I am a shepherd whose boat is soon coming. My boat of glory is coming; and I come with it, and bring my sheep and lambs in aboard it. Every one who gives ear to my call and heed gives unto my voice, and who turns his gaze unto me, of him take I hold with my hands and bring him unto me inboard my boat."

 <p>   The next piece I have selected, treats of the source of all glory and enlightenment, called the Treasury of Life, that in which all spiritual powers and blessings are stored. The origin of the motive is without doubt the Iranian concept of the <i>ḥvareno</i>, the divine and kingly glory. In the Mandæan tradition it has become highly developed and is frequently personified as a female greatness. Thus in the Oxford MS. F. it is spoken of as "the Mother of all the Kings [of the Light], from whom all worlds have come forth, who separated herself from the fervency of the Hidden Mysteries." Many <i>rôles</i> are assigned to this Light of Life in the complexities of the celestial and cosmic dramas; and in the human stage it shines forth as the glory with which the perfected are vestured and
 
 <!------------------------page 86------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a>
 
 crowned. I have chosen the simplest of the narratives or discourses on the topic. In the still more complex system of the phase of development represented by the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> collection there is no mention of the Treasury of Life, but the Treasury of Light is one of its most important conceptions. The Mandæan tradition conserves the echoes of an earlier phase, for it is indubitably less over-worked.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <blockquote>
 
 <p align="center">THE TREASURY OF LIFE (§ 57).</p>
 
 <p align="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</p>
 
 <p>   THE Treasury am I, Life's Treasury (Sīmath-Haiyē); the Treasury am I, the Mighty One's Treasury; the Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A crown was I for the Mighty from everlasting. The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. Ever did I give light to the treasures and to the shekīnahs, and was for adornment to Jordan. For adornment became I to Jordan, who was from everlasting, through whom the treasures give light. Great [Life] made me limpid and lucent and made me into a vesture. He made me into his vesture, which day in and day out sings measureless praise of the Æther.</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. To the King of the Splendour became I a crown. The treasures shine through my glory and praise my form beyond measure.</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury—I who as adornment settled down on the King of the Splendour, so that he shone in his mind, that he became bright and shining, and his form glittered more than the [light-] worlds. As I (lit. it) gave light and enlightenment unto the treasures and to the shekīnahs [e'en] in the Æther, the King laid me as vesture round N<sup>e</sup>ṣab the Radiant.<a name="page_86_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_86_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> N<sup>e</sup>ṣab the Radiant then took me, brought me and laid me as vesture o'er Jordan. As vesture o'er Jordan he laid me, through whom the treasures shine beyond measure.</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. The wicked are blind
 
 <!------------------------page 87------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a>
 
 and see not. I call them unto the Light, yet they busy themselves with the Darkness. "O ye wicked," I unto them cry, "ye who sink down in the Darkness, arise and fall not into the deep." I cry unto them; yet the wicked hear not and sink into the great Sea of the Ending. Therefore was Jordan made a bridge for the treasures; a bridge for the treasures became he, while he cut off the wicked and hurled them into the great Sea of the Ending.</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A crown I became for Life's Gnosis. He bestowed on me the rulership over the treasures and the shekīnahs which are there [yonder].</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. Of the light-worlds was I the enlightener. Day in and day out they sing praise to Great [Life], and through me they mount upward and behold the Light's region.</p>
 
 <p>   The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A vesture for the light-worlds became I.</p>
 
 <p>   [The Treasury] am I, Life's Treasury. A King for the Nazōræans became I. I became a King for the Nazōræans, who through my Name find praise and assurance. Praise and assurance they find through my Name, and on my Name they mount up and behold the Light's region. For the Men of purity put to the test—[for them] their eye became full of Light. Full of Light was their eye, and in their heart Life's Gnosis took seat. Whoever of me, Life's Treasury, makes his investment, loves not gold and silver, loves not gold and possessions, [loves not] food of the body, and envy with him has no place. Envy found with him no place, and he did not forget his night-prayer. He forgot not the discourses and writings, and he forsook not his Lord's word. He forsook not the prayer of his Father, Life's Gnosis; wherefor into the great End-Sea he falls not. He forgot not Sunday, nor did he neglect the Day's evening. He forgot not the way of Great [Life, the way] of wages and alms. He will be rapt away in the night-prayer, he will be rapt away in shining vestures which have come from Great [Life]. Treasures for him fill up what falls short, and what is empty they load for him full. If he bears a pure load, he is counted with the Men of piety put to the test who separate themselves [from the world] in the Name of Yawar.<a name="page_87_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_87_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> Life's

 Treasury rested upon them, to their form it gave light, and for them a way to Great [Life's] House has been established.</p>
 
 <p>   I have called with clear voice and directed hereto the disciples: "The vine who bears fruit, doth ascend; who bears none will here be cut off. Whosoever lets himself be enlightened through me and instructed, ascends and beholds the Light's region; whoever does not let himself be enlightened through me and instructed, is cut off and falls into the great End-Sea."</p>

 <p>   That the Mandæan religion preserves echoes of a wealth of ancient mythical elements found in Iranian, Babylonian and Semitic traditions is evident on all hands. A process of syncretism had presumably gone on for generations before an impulse from within caused the blending to assume a distinctively Mandæan form; and when this emerged, the preservation of the memory of the process had no interest for the faith and fell back into the depths of the subconscious. At any-rate the writers or recorders of the tractates throughout seem honestly persuaded of the complete independence of their tradition from every other form of religion. They are for ever proclaiming the blessings of loyalty to what they claim to be the original, the one and only, revelation of Truth vouchsafed to the world throughout the ages, and declaring that continued spiritual contact with instructors from on high who mediated this divine wisdom, was still possible. They certainly do not give one the idea of being intellectualists consciously at work on a syncretic synthesis of prior material; on the contrary they seem to live and move in a milieu of prophetical outpourings and to have been extremely sensitive to psychical impressions. Inspirational discourses and intuitive interpretations of prophetical
 
 <!------------------------page 89------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a>
 
 utterances seem to have been their delight. The following piece may enable the reader to sense somewhat of the peculiar atmosphere of mystical expectancy in which they sought instruction. The topic is one of the chief points of their questioning—the conflict that arose between the Light and the Darkness in the beginnings and how victory is to be achieved. They were not of course absolute Dualists, for always and everywhere victory lies with Life Everlasting, who transcends not only the Darkness but also the Light.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <blockquote>
 
 <p align="center">IN THE BEGINNING (§ 13).</p>
 
 <p align="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</p>
 
 <p>   To you I say and declare, ye chosen and perfect, ye who dwell in the world: Become not of the Darkness a portion, but lift up your eyes to Light's region. From the Evil unto the Good separate yourselves out; from the sinful evil of the region of Darkness separate yourselves out. Love and instruct one another, that your sin and [your] guilt be forgiven you. See and hear and get you instructed, that ye may ascend to Light's region victorious.</p>
 
 <p>   The good sit there and are in search; and all who are understanding let themselves be instructed. The good speak, take counsel together and say: "Who will come, who tell me, who will set [it] forth for me, who give me instruction? Who will come, who will tell me whether there was <i>one</i> King or <i>two</i> [in the beginning]?" The good speak and let themselves be instructed.</p>
 
 <p>   "<i>Two</i> Kings were there, <i>two</i> natures were fashioned—a King of this world and a King from outside of the worlds. The King of this age girt on a sword and [put on] a crown of Darkness. A crown of Darkness he put on his head, and took a sword in his right hand. A sword he took in his right hand; he stands there and slaughters his sons, and his sons slaughter each other. The King from outside of the worlds set a crown of Light on his head. A crown of Light he set on his head, and took Truth in his right hand. Truth in his right hand he took, and stands there and

 instructs his sons. He stands there and instructs his sons, and his sons instruct one another."</p>
 
 <p>   "Who will come, who tell me what was before this? When the heaven was not yet outspread and stars were not yet in it figured, when the earth was not yet condensed and into the water no condensation had fallen, when sun and moon came not as yet into this world, how was the soul then?"</p>
 
 <p>   "When the soul still sat in the Bowl,<a name="page_90_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_90_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> she felt neither hunger nor thirst. When the soul still sat in the Bowl, she had no pains and no faults. When the soul still sat in the Bowl, she felt no cold and no heat. When she still sat in the Bowl, the locks on her forehead<a name="page_90_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_90_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> were incurled, and an æther-crown sat on her head. Her eyes were light-rays (?), and they gazed on the region of the House of Great [Life]. Her mouth was of pure[st] perfection, and sang the praise of the King of Light's region.</p>
 
 <p>   "From the day when the Wicked began to think, evil pictured itself forth in him. He fell into great wrath and ventured a fight with the Light. The Envoy was sent to tread down the power of the rebels.</p>

 <p>   The Mandæans possess a rich collection of liturgical songs and hymns which Lidzbarski has translated for the first time in his excellent edition of them (<i>Mandäische Liturgien</i>, Berlin, 1920). From these 236 hymns we choose one of the most typical as a specimen, and as perhaps of more than ordinary interest to the general reader who may have puzzled over the unqualified beatitude "Blessed are the poor."

    who has kept himself stranger to this world,<br>
 The world of the defect,<br>
    in which the Planets are seated.<br>
 They sit on thrones of rebellion<br>
    and drill their works with the scourge.<br>
 For gold and for silver are they disquiet,<br>
    and strife they cast into the world.<br>
 Disquiet are they and therein cast strife;<br>
    therefore will they go hence and seethe in the fire.<br>
 The wicked shall seethe, and their pomp<br>
    shall vanish and come to an end.<br>
 But I with my offspring and kindred<br>
    shall ascend and see the Light's region,<br>

 <br>
 The region whose sun never sets,<br>
    and whose light-lamps never darken—<br>
 That region, the state [of the Blessed],<br>
    whereto your souls are called and invited.<br>
  <br>
 And so are our good brothers' souls,<br>
    and the souls of our faithful sisters.<br>
  <br>
 Life is exalted and is victorious, and victorious is the Man who has come hither.<br>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_71_note_1"></a><a href="#page_71_fr_1">1</a> This section is the most difficult of all to translate owing to the abundance of technical fishing terms. In spite of marvellous philological industry and wide-flung enquiries L. has been unable to identify a number of words.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_71_note_2"></a><a href="#page_71_fr_2">2</a> <i>Sc</i>. the faithful.</p>

 <p><a name="page_72_note_1"></a><a href="#page_72_fr_1">1</a> <i>Sc</i>. the Seven.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_72_note_2"></a><a href="#page_72_fr_2">2</a> Lit. 'on the high seas' L. glosses this as meaning that they are not river fish; but this seems to me unnecessary, as my rendering suggests.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_72_note_3"></a><a href="#page_72_fr_3">3</a> Used apparently by the fish-seller for advertising his wares.</p>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_73_note_1"></a><a href="#page_73_fr_1">1</a> Evidently a wind-instrument of some kind.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_73_note_2"></a><a href="#page_73_fr_2">2</a> Presumably a water-bird.</p>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_74_note_1"></a><a href="#page_74_fr_1">1</a> K. is the infernal river which the souls have to cross after death; its waters are figured as dragons and its waves as scorpions (§ 51). Ulai is also a river. If it is in any way connected with the Eulæus from which the Kings of Persia are fabled to have drunk, the sense is hard to find. It is more probably an infernal stream, at any rate one from which the evil fishers drank.</p>
 
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_76_note_1"></a><a href="#page_76_fr_1">1</a> Uncertain. Père Anastase of Baghdad informs L. that now-a-days a bell is attached to the rudder-bar; but here it seems to have some connection with the axe.</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 77------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_77_note_1"></a><a href="#page_77_fr_1">1</a> L. suggests so as to seek the spawning places or in order to hide themselves.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_77_note_2"></a><a href="#page_77_fr_2">2</a> The numerous gaps which have to be left owing to uncertainty of translation make a number of the above sentences unintelligible. The concluding paragraphs are presumably an allegory of the attractions of false religions, and can hardly be thought to be part of the speech of the fishers.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_77_note_3"></a><a href="#page_77_fr_3">3</a> Presumably as the waves made by the foundering ships reach the shore.</p>

 <p><a name="page_78_note_2"></a><a href="#page_78_fr_2">2</a> In the M. text, 146, 12, this is given as Sidmā. L. thinks it is a water-fowl of some kind.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_78_note_3"></a><a href="#page_78_fr_3">3</a> Presumably because it is always diving after its prey.</p>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_81_note_1"></a><a href="#page_81_fr_1">1</a> The salt, bitter, water of the sea of death and destruction, as opposed to the fresh, sweet water, the living water or water of Life.</p>

 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 82------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_82_note_1"></a><a href="#page_82_fr_1">1</a> This may mean at a certain period or appointed time.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_82_note_2"></a><a href="#page_82_fr_2">2</a> The faithful are figured as birds as well as sheep.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_82_note_3"></a><a href="#page_82_fr_3">3</a> An untranslatable idiom.</p>

 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 83------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_83_note_1"></a><a href="#page_83_fr_1">1</a> Lidzbarski (p. 465) thinks this refers to the Moslim period. Elsewhere we find the parallel phrase 'age of Bizbat,' which L. also refers to Muhammad. But Bizbat is clearly a corrupt form of Baal-Zebul, and therefore the reference should be more general.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_83_note_2"></a><a href="#page_83_fr_2">2</a> Presumably stars.</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 84------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a>

 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 85------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_85_note_1"></a><a href="#page_85_fr_1">1</a> A still more degraded form of cult is mentioned, but the meaning baffles the translator; it is referred to those who bow down before Rūhā, here in mockery called 'Holy' Spirit.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_85_note_2"></a><a href="#page_85_fr_2">2</a> The above is obscure, especially the 'pen-demon' reference. The general sense. however, seems to be that those who fall away from the Mandæan faith are not to be restrained by force, but let go their way.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_85_note_3"></a><a href="#page_85_fr_3">3</a> <i>Sc</i>. Life. The concluding paragraph runs on without break in the German, being assigned to the same speaker; but the subject is clearly changed and the whole spirit is different. The Good Shepherd now seeks for the lost sheep and does not leave it to perish.</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 86------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_86_note_1"></a><a href="#page_86_fr_1">1</a> In § 9 (<a href="gjb-2-1.htm#page_39">p. 39</a>) N. is called the Watcher who has his station in every region, <i>i.e.</i> the Great Watcher.</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 87------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_87_note_1"></a><a href="#page_87_fr_1">1</a> Y. is the Helper or Saviour. The shekīnah or celestial abode of Yawar, the Chosen, is the Home of the Blessed (<i>cp</i>. J.B. 189<small>4</small>).</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 90------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_90_note_1"></a><a href="#page_90_fr_1">1</a> <i>Kannā</i>. L. leaves this technical term untranslated; but in note 4 to p. 4 he shows that it frequently means a wine-cup or wine-bowl. I would therefore venture to connect it with the widespread notion of the <i>kratēr</i> or mixing-bowl of souls as handed on, for instance, by Plato in the Timæus, presumably from Hither Asian sources. One of the treatises of the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> is called 'The Cup' or 'The Bowl,' or alternatively 'The Monad.' It was not only the source of souls, but also the Mind into which they had to be dowsed for spiritual baptism or regeneration.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_90_note_2"></a><a href="#page_90_fr_2">2</a> Presumably the rays of glory, signifying a state of contemplation.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_90_note_3"></a><a href="#page_90_fr_3">3</a> The supernal powers.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_90_note_4"></a><a href="#page_90_fr_4">4</a> I can find no explanation of this occasionally recurring figure; it indubitably goes back to some ancient myth.</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 91------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_91_note_1"></a><a href="#page_91_fr_1">1</a> In a number of the Gnostic systems of the Early Christian period the body of the first man is said to lie like a log till the light-spark is breathed into him.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_91_note_2"></a><a href="#page_91_fr_2">2</a> <i>Sc</i>. the heavenly powers.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_91_note_3"></a><a href="#page_91_fr_3">3</a> Presumably Adam</p>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_93_note_1"></a><a href="#page_93_fr_1">1</a> Or "One of the Poor am I," Compare the Ebionīm or Poor of early Christianity; the Poor (spiritually) are those who have voluntarily renounced this world's goods.</p>
