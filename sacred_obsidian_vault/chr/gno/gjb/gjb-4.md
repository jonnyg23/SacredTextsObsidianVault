 <h2 align="center">THE FOURTH GOSPEL PROEM:</h2>
 
 <p align="center"><big>A NEW VERSION VENTURE.</big></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p align="center">CONNECTION.</p>
 
 <p>   AFTER I had for some time been making a close study of Lidzbarski's translations of the Mandæan John-Book and Liturgies, I had occasion in another connection to refer to the Greek text (Westcott &amp; Hort) of the prologue to the fourth gospel. As I read, I found that a number of Mandæan associations came welling up from the preconscious, especially with regard to Life and Light, the use of the term Man and the way the sentences about John the Baptist linked on to these concepts. I found I was almost automatically construing parts of this familiar text from a new angle or at any rate envisaging them in a new perspective. I had already for long been convinced that the historical references broke awkwardly into the doctrinal proem proper, and that this contained what may be called some characteristic general gnostic notions. Moreover I had long been of the opinion that the proem was based on a 'source'; but thought that this 'source' was most probably already in Greek when it was made such deft use of by the inspired writer of the 'pneumatic' gospel. I now asked myself, could it possibly have been originally in Aramaic, for there are indubitably some strained constructions in it, that might be explicable as literal renderings of Semitic idioms. Translation into Greek would doubtless make the original appear to be more hellenistically coloured than was actually the case and so 'philosophize' it somewhat. The main difficulty seemed to lie in determining
 
 <!------------------------page 121------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a>
 
 what could have been the Semitic original of the leading term rendered by <i>Logos</i>? Was it Word or Wisdom or some other Divine Power or Potency? On this I could form no conclusion. But further, whatever it was, could it have been translated by any other Greek term than <i>Logos</i>? For the student of comparative Hellenistic theology is not confined to seeking for parallels or associations with the idea behind this term in Stoicism and Philo simply; he has to take into consideration a far wider field of research. In the Trismegistic literature, for instance, in which the Heavenly Man doctrine is prominent, the parallel notion is rendered by <i>Noûs</i>, Mind, and in the Hellenistic poem so beloved by the Later Platonists and generally known as the 'Chaldæan Oracles,'<a name="page_121_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_121_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> the Mind of the Father stands at the summit; while in allied Gnostic tradition connected with the 'Chaldæan Mysteries' or even said to be based on the 'Chaldæan Books,' where again the Divine Man doctrine is prominent, the term preferred is Mind. Mind, moreover, in the Valentinian system stands at the head of the Plērōma. This is solely with regard to translation into Greek in the general Hellenistic theological language of the time, and says nothing about the Semitic or Chaldæan original terms, which may have been numerous, apart from the very general (notably Egyptian) Oriental magical notion of creation by the word. Certainly the Man-doctrine was wide-spread and where personifications were the order of the day, Man and Mind would go better together than Man and Word or Reason or even Wisdom. It is, however, with all hesitation that I have ventured to use the term Mind in my translation,

 <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a>
 
 find more to call attention to the problem than anything else.</p>
 
 <p>   With these ideas—namely the supposal of a probable Aramaic original of the proem-source and the consequent 'philosophizing' by translation into Hellenistic Greek of some terms that in the original were more concretely presented, I attempted the following version. This I did before I had read Prof. C. F. Burney's recent (1922) arresting study, entitled <i>The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel</i> (Oxford, The Clarendon Press). The contention of the Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at Oxford, who is so great an authority on the O.T., is that not only for the proem but for much, if not the whole, of the gospel there is an Aramaic background. Whatever may be ultimately decided on this novel and far-reaching hypothesis, it should inaugurate a fruitful line of N.T. research. My own venture is far more modest in every way; I deal with a single 'source' only, and have not the competence to treat even that technically from the Semitic side. The only remark I would venture to make on Prof. Burney's labours is in respect to the Johannine Greek quotations from the O.T. The problem whether the few of them which differ from the LXX. Greek Targum or Translation,—the Authorised Version of the time so to say,—were made freshly from the Hebrew, does not seem to me necessarily to help to prove the author's contention. They are far more likely to have been taken from what is said to have been probably the earliest Christian Greek document,—a collection of proof-texts to establish the claims of Christian Messianism from O.T. prophecy, at times not without accommodation. They sometimes agree with and sometimes diverge from the Septuagint rendering.

 <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a>
 
 All this has been most thoroughly worked out by Proff. Rendel Harris and Vacher Burch in their indispensable work (Pt. I., 1916, Pt. II., 1920) on the now famous Testimony Book (<i>Testimonia contra Judæos</i>).</p>
 
 <p>   I also conjectured, presumably owing to the rhythms of the Mandæan books running in my head, that the 'source' might have been in verse; and found that the Greek broke up easily into some sort of rhythmic lines. But of course this was pure guesswork on my part. Professor Burney, however, with his wide knowledge of Hebrew and Palestinian Aramaic, has come most definitely to this conclusion as to the proem. If the rest of the gospel cannot be so treated, this seems to me to be an additional indication that in the prologue we are dealing with a 'source.' Though my tentative translation from the Greek differs both in analysis and phrasing from Prof. Burney's, I so far see no compelling reason to alter the phrasing by his, and let the breaking up of the lines stand to indicate rhythm rather than the measured lines he has so ingeniously endeavoured to reconstruct into Aramaic.</p>

 <p><a name="page_123_note_1"></a><a href="#page_123_fr_1">1</a> In the original this was probably the usual cosmological formula 'in the beginning.' The Greek may suggest a more metaphysical meaning and the Vulgate Latin seems to continue the process, for <i>principium</i> might carry the weaning of 'primality'; cp. Cicero, <i>Tusc</i>. i. 23, 54: "There is no origin of primality (<i>principii</i>); for it is out of primality that all things originate"; Tertullian, <i>Adv. Hermog.</i> 19: "In Greek the term primality, namely ἀρχή, takes the primacy (<i>principatum</i>), not only in the category of order (<i>ordinativum</i>), but also in that of potency (<i>potestivum</i>)."</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_123_note_2"></a><a href="#page_123_fr_2">2</a> If there is any Mandæan term with which to seek a parallel it might perhaps be Mānā, which seems generally to mean Mind. Prof. Rendel Harris in his illuminating study of the Proem, would make the original of Logos 'Wisdom' (Ḥokhmah), and brings forward some striking quotations from the O.T. sapiential literature and Patristic commentaries in justification. This Hebrew (O.T.) and Greek (Apocryphal) Wisdom-literature is clearly influenced Hellenistically, and the equation Logos = Sophia in the <i>Gk. version</i> of the 4th gospel is of great interest. In addition to R. H.'s <i>Origin of the Prologue to St. John.'s Gospel</i>, see his interesting paper 'Athena, Sophia and the Logos,' pp. 56-72 of the <i>Bulletin</i> of the John Rylands Library, Manchester, July, 1922. It may be objected that 'Word' is to be preferred, seeing that in the Targums Memrah = the Creative Word, Logos; but my contention is that the Greek Noûs is nearer to the Deity than the Greek Logos.</p>

 <p><a name="page_124_note_1"></a><a href="#page_124_fr_1">1</a> The Gk. phrase πρὸς τὸν θεόν is a grammatical puzzle; this is, however, probably solved by the hypothesis of a literal translation from a Semitic original. The Gnostic Heracleon (2nd cent.); the first known commentator on the fourth gospel, who was apparently ignorant of Semitics, conjectured that ἡνωμένος ('at-one-with,' 'in-co-adunition-with') should be supplied; others think the phrase is Hellenistic (Koinē) for παρὰ τῳ̑ θεόῳ̑—<i>i.e.</i>, 'along with,' 'by the side of,' or simply 'with' God. In the Greek text ὁ θεός is distinguished (and I think deliberately), by the prefixing of the definite article, from the following simple θεός. But 'The God' is clumsy in English, and so I resort to the type-trick of capitalization to mark the distinction.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_124_note_2"></a><a href="#page_124_fr_2">2</a> The Gk. καὶ renders probably a Semitic particle that serves several other purposes than that of a purely copulative function.</p>

Burkitt, <i>Evangelion da-Mepharreshe: The Curetonian Version of the Four Gospels, with the Readings of the Sinai Palimpsest and the Early Syriac Patristic Evidence</i> (Cambridge, 1904), i. 423. The Old (<i>i.e.</i> pre-Peshītṭā) Syriac versions should be a great help in determining the Aram. original, as the two dialects are closely related.</p>

All this connects with the Anthrōpos-doctrine of the Gnosis. Man (the Aram. idiom 'Son of Man,' if translated literally, is misleading in Gk.) is the Celestial or Primal Man, Adam Qadmon. As Thrice-greatest Hermes says, the vast majority of mortals are not worthy to be called 'Men'; all men have Reason, but few as yet have Mind (<i>i.e</i>. are spiritual). The true Men who have the Light of Life are the Prophets and Perfect.</p>

 <p><a name="page_126_note_7"></a><a href="#page_126_fr_7">7</a> <i>Mono-genēs</i>,—this in pre- and post-Christian Gnostic tradition is the general technical term for 'born,' 'emanated' or 'created' from a 'single source (μονο-), <i>i.e.</i> one-and-only parent, and is used of spiritual beings who are superior to the conditions of sex-generation. Cp. the <i>perikopē</i> on Melchi Sedek (King of Peace, Prince of Righteousness) in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb.htm#7:1">Heb. 7:1-21</a>. He is there said to be "father-less, mother-less, [earthly] genealogy-less, without beginning of days or end of life, but made-in-the-likeness of GOD'S Son." In common speech <i>monogenēs</i> is usually found as meaning the only one of a kind; if only one daughter has been born to a man, she would be characterized as <i>monogenēs</i>. But the vulgar tongue is <i>not</i> the language of mysticism. In the above-referred to article (p. 123) Prof. Rendel Harris thinks that the meaning of <i>monogenēs</i> as 'child of one parent only,' as applied to Athena born from the head of Zeus, which he suggests, but rejects, is a 'quite new' idea; but I have been insisting on it for a score of years at least. He would render it as 'darling,' but this is really too <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_126_note_11"></a><a href="#page_126_fr_11">11</a> The Greek translator unquestionably understood this as referring to Yeshū' Messiah. But the puzzling phrasing of the quotation from the Baptist <i>logoi</i>-tradition—'my First'—seems to require 'it' instead of 'him,' <i>viz</i>., the Mind-Life-Light of the 'source,' as in the first interpolation.</p>

 <p><a name="page_127_note_4"></a><a href="#page_127_fr_4">4</a> This seems to me to be a distinct reference to the Gnostic notion of pairs or syzygies in the Plērōma; cp. the "Hence pairing with each other (ἀντιστοιχου̑ντες)" of the <i>Apophasis</i> ascribed to Simon Magus (Hippolytus, <i>Ref</i>. vi. 18). The term is used by Xenophon (<i>Ana</i>. v. 4, 12) of two bands of dancers facing each other in rows or pairs (see my <i>Simon Magus</i>, 1892, p. 20).</p>

 <p><a name="page_127_note_7"></a><a href="#page_127_fr_7">7</a> Cp. the Jewish Gnostic commentator of the Naassene Document, quoting from a prior 'scripture,' or an oral '<i>logos</i>' ('what was spoken'): "His voice we heard, but his form we have not seen." (See my analysis of this very important Gnostic Document in <i>Thrice-greatest Hermes</i>, London, 1906, in Prolegomena, § 'The Myth of Man in the Mysteries'; the quotation is to be found in i. 169.) Compare with this <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#5:37">Jn. 5:37</a>: "Ye have never at any time heard his voice, nor have ye seen his form," addressed to the Jews in general; whereas the Naassene quotation refers to the Perfect. This is very important, for if my analysis of the NN. document, which Hippolytus copied, is correct, the Jewish mystic, who commented on the Hellenistic source, was in all probability contemporary with Philo (c. 30 B.C. -45 A.D.), and therefore we have here an indication of another 'source' of the fourth gospel (of which there may have been a number).</p>
