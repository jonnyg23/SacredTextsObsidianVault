 <p>When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said unto them: "Now, therefore, let him whom his spirit stirreth, come forward and speak the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia."</p>  
 <p>Peter answered and said: "O Lord, concerning this thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David in the one-hundred-and-nineteenth Psalm; saying:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Peter interpreteth the tenth repentance from Psalm cxix.</font></span>"'1. I cried unto thee, O Lord, in my oppression, and thou hearkenest unto me.</p>  
 <p>"'2. O Lord, save |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>101</b>.</font></span> my soul from unjust lips and from crafty tongues.</p>  
 <p>"'3. What will be given unto thee or what will be added unto thee with a crafty tongue?</p>  
 <p>"'4. The arrows of the strong [one] are made sharp with the coal of the desert.</p>

 <p>"'5. Woe unto me, that my dwelling is far off, and I dwelt in the tents of Kedar.</p>  
 <p>"'6. My soul hath dwelt in many regions as a guest.</p>  
 <p>"'7. I was peaceful with them who hate peace; if I spake unto them, they fought against me without a cause.'</p>  
 <p>"This is now, therefore, O Lord, the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia, which she hath uttered when the material emanations of Self-willed oppressed her, they and his lion-faced power, and when they oppressed her exceedingly."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus commendeth Peter.</font></span>Jesus said unto him: "Well said, Peter, and finely. This is the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia."</p>
