 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus putteth on his vesture.</font></span>"It came to pass then, when I saw the mystery of all these words in the vesture which was sent me, that straightway I clothed myself therewith, and I shone most exceedingly and soared into the height.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">He entereth the firmament.</font></span>"I came before the [first] gate of the firmament, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me, and the gates of the firmament were shaken one over against another and all opened at once.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The powers of the firmament are amazed and fall down and adore him.</font></span>"And all rulers and all authorities and all angels therein were thrown all together into agitation because of the great light which was on me. And they gazed at the radiant vesture of</p>

And all their bonds with which they were bound, were unloosed and every one left his order, and they all fell down before me, adored and said: 'How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing?' And they all sang praises together to the interiors of the interiors; but me they saw not, but they saw only the light. And they were in great fear and were exceedingly agitated and sang praises to the interiors of the interiors.</p>
