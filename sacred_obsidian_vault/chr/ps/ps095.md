 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary again questioneth Jesus.</font></span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forward again, continued and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, in what type will</p>  
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></a></p>  
 <p>be those who have received the mystery of the Light, in the midst of the last Helper?"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of those who receive the mystery in the last Helper.</font></span>And Jesus answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the disciples: "They who have received the mystery of the Light, if they come out of the body of the matter of the rulers, then will every one be in his order according to the mystery which he hath received. Those who have received the higher mysteries, will abide in the higher order; those who have received the lower mysteries will be in the lower orders. In a word, up to what region every one hath received mysteries, there will he abide in his order in the Inheritance of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you aforetime: 'Where your heart is, there will your treasure be,'--that is up to what region every one hath received mysteries, there shall he be."</p>  
 <p>It came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that John came forward and said unto Jesus: "My Lord and my Saviour, give me also commandment that I discourse before thee, and be not wroth with me if I question concerning all with precision and certainty; for thou, my Lord, hast promised me in a promise to make revelation unto us of all concerning which I shall question thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, hide nothing from us at all in the matter on which we shall question thee."</p>  
 <p>And Jesus answered in great compassion and said unto John: "To thee also, blessed John, and beloved, I give commandment to speak the word which pleaseth thee, and I will reveal it unto thee face to face without similitude, and I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></a></p>  
 <p>will say unto thee |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>203</b>.</font></span> all on which thou wilt question me with precision and certainty."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">John questioneth Jesus.</font></span>And John answered and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, will then every one abide in the region up to which he hath received the mysteries, and hath he no power to go. into other orders which are above him; and hath he no power to go into the orders which are below him?"</p>
