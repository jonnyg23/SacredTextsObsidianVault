 <p>Mary continued again and said: "My Lord, a man who hath known the godhead and hath received of the mysteries of the Light, and hath turned and transgressed and done lawlessly and hath not turned to repent, and a man on the other hand who hath not found the godhead nor known it, and that man is a sinner and moreover impious, and they both have come out of the body,--which of them will get more suffering in the judgments?"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The fate of the gnostic who sinneth is more terrible than that of the ignorant sinner.</font></span>The Saviour answered again and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto thee: The man who hath known the godhead and hath received the mysteries of the Light, and sinned and hath not turned to repent, he will get suffering in the chastisements of the judgments in great sufferings and |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>316</b>.</font></span> judgments exceedingly far more in comparison with the impious and law-breaking man who hath not known the godhead.

For from every one to whom more is entrusted, of him will more be demanded, and to whom much is handed over, of him much is required,'--that is, my Lord: He who knew the godhead and hath found the mysteries of the Light and hath transgressed, will be chastized in a far greater chastisement than he who hath not known the godhead. This, my Lord, is the solution of the word."</p>
