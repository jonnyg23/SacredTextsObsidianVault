 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The emanations of Self-willed cease for a time to oppress Sophia.</font></span>When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he answered again and said unto them: "It came to pass then, when the lion-faced power had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up altogether out of the chaos, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>85</b>.</font></span> that it came again with all the other material emanations of Self-willed, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia again. It came to pass then, when they oppressed her, that she cried out in the same repentance, saying:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">She continueth her repentance.</font></span>"'9. Have mercy upon me, O Light, for they have oppressed me again. Because of thy commandment, the light in me is distracted and my power and my understanding.</p>  
 <p>"'10. My power hath begun to wane whiles I am in these afflictions, and the number of my time whiles I am in the chaos. My light is diminished, for they have taken away my power from me, and all the powers in me are tossed about.</p>  
 <p>"'11. I am become powerless in the presence of all the rulers of the æons, who hate me, and in the presence of the four-and-twenty emanations, in whose region I was. And my brother, my</p>  
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></a></p>  
 <p>pair, was afraid to help me, because of that in which they have set me.</p>  
 <p>"'12. And all the rulers of the height have counted me as matter in which is no light. I am become as a material power which hath fallen out of the rulers,</p>  
 <p>"'13. And all who are in the æons said: She hath become chaos. And thereafter all the pitiless powers encompassed me together and proposed to take away the whole light in me.</p>  
 <p>"'14. But I have trusted in thee, O Light, and said: Thou art my saviour.</p>  
 <p>"'15. And my commandment, which thou hast decreed for me, is in thy hands. Save me out of the hands of the emanations of Self-willed, which oppress me and persecute me.</p>  
 <p>"'16. Send thy light over me, for I am as naught before thee, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>86</b>.</font></span> and save me according to thy compassion.</p>  
 <p>"'17. Let me not be despised, for I have sung praises unto thee, O Light. Let chaos cover the emanations of Self-willed, let them be led down into the darkness.</p>  
 <p>"'18. Let the mouth of them be shut up, who would devour me with guile, who say: Let us take the whole light in her,--although I have done them no ill.'"</p>
