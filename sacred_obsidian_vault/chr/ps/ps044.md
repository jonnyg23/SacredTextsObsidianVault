 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">John asketh and receiveth permission to speak.</font></span>It came to pass while Jesus spake these words unto his disciples, saying unto them: "This is the fourth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered; now, therefore, let him who understandeth, understand,"--it came to pass then, when Jesus had spoken these words, that John came forward, adored the breast of Jesus and said unto him: "My Lord, give commandment to me also, and grant me to speak the solution of the fourth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>  
 <p>Jesus said unto John: "I give thee commandment, and I grant thee to speak the solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>  
 <p>John answered and said: "My Lord and Saviour, concerning this repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, thy light-power which was in David, hath prophesied aforetime in the one-hundred-and-first Psalm:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">John interpreteth the repentance from Psalm ci.</font></span>"'1. Lord, give ear unto my supplication and let my voice reach unto thee.</p>  
 <p>"'2. Turn not away thy face from me; incline thine ear unto me in the day when I am oppressed; quickly give ear to me on the day when I shall cry unto thee.</p>  
 <p>"'3. For |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>66</b>.</font></span> my days are vanished as smoke and my bones are parched as stone.</p>  
 <p>"'4. I am scorched as the grass, and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'5. From the voice of my groaning my bones cleaved to my flesh.</p>  
 <p>"'6. I am become as a pelican in the desert; I am become as a screech-owl in the house.</p>  
 <p>"'7. I have passed the night watching; I am become as a sparrow alone on the roof.</p>  
 <p>"'8. My enemies have reviled me all the day long, and they who honour me, have injured me.</p>  
 <p>"'9. For I have eaten ashes instead of my bread and mixed my drink with tears,</p>  
 <p>"'10. Because of thy wrath and thy rage; for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.</p>  
 <p>"'11. My days have declined as a shadow, and I am dried up as the grass,</p>  
 <p>"'12. But thou, O Lord, thou endurest for ever, and thy remembrance unto the generation of generation[s].</p>  
 <p>"'13. Arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time is come to have mercy upon her; the proper time is come.</p>  
 <p>"'14. Thy servants have longed for her stones, and will take pity on her land.</p>  
 <p>"'15. And the nations will have fear of the name of the Lord, and the kings of the earth have fear of thy sovereignty.</p>  
 <p>"'16. For the Lord will build up Zion and reveal himself in his sovereignty.</p>  
 <p>"17. He hath regarded the prayer of the humble and hath not despised their supplication.</p>  
 <p>"'18. This shall be recorded for another generation, and the people who shall be created will praise the Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'19. Because he hath looked down on his holy height; the Lord hath looked down from the heaven on the earth,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'20. To hear the sighing |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>67</b>.</font></span> of those in chains, to loose the sons of those who are slain,</p>  
 <p>"'21. To proclaim the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem.'</p>  
 <p>"This, my Lord, is the solution of the mystery of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>
