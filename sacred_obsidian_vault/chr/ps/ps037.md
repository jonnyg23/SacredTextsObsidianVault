 <p>It came to pass then, when Jesus had spoken</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: "This is the song of praise which Pistis Sophia uttered in her first repentance, repenting of her sin, and reciting all which had befallen her. Now, therefore: 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.'"</p>  
 <p>Mary again came forward and said: "My Lord, my indweller of light hath ears, and I hear with my light-power, and thy spirit which is with me, hath sobered me. Hearken then that I may speak concerning the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, speaking of |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>53</b>.</font></span> her sin and all that befell her. Thy light-power hath prophesied thereof aforetime through the prophet David in the sixty-eighth Psalm:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary interpreteth the first repentance from Psalm lxviii</font></span>"'1. Save me, O God, for the waters are come in even unto my soul.</p>  
 <p>"'2. I sank, or am submerged, in the slime of the abyss, and power was not. I have gone-down into the depths of the sea; a tempest hath submerged me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. I have kept on crying; my throat is gone, my eyes faded, waiting patiently for God.</p>  
 <p>"'4. They who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; mighty are my foes, who violently pursued me. They required of me that which I took not from them.</p>  
 <p>"'5. God, thou hast known my foolishness, and my faults are not hid from thee.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord, Lord of powers, be ashamed for my sake; let not those who seek thee be ashamed for my sake, O Lord, God of Israel, God of powers.</p>  
 <p>"'7. <a href="errata.htm#0">For</a> thy sake have I endured shame; shame hath covered my face.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'8. I am become a stranger to my brethren, a stranger unto the sons of my mother.</p>  
 <p>"'9. For the zeal of thy house hath consumed me; the revilings of them that revile thee have fallen upon me.</p>  
 <p>"'10. I bowed my soul with fasting, and it was turned to my reproach.</p>  
 <p>"'11. I put on sackcloth; I became unto them a bye-word.</p>  
 <p>"'12. They who sit at the gates, chattered at me; and they who drink wine, harped about me.</p>  
 <p>"'13. But I prayed with my soul unto thee, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>54</b>.</font></span> O Lord; the time of thy well-liking is [now], O God. In the fulness of thy grace give ear unto my salvation in truth.</p>  
 <p>"'14. Save me out of this slime, that I sink not therein; let me be saved from them that hate me, and from the deep of waters.</p>  
 <p>"'15. Let not a water-flood submerge me, let not the deep swallow me, let not a well close its mouth above me.</p>  
 <p>"'16. Hear me, O Lord, for thy grace is good; according to the fulness of thy compassion look down upon me.</p>  
 <p>"'17. Turn not thy face away from thy servant, for I am oppressed.</p>  
 <p>"'18. Hear me quickly, give heed to my soul and deliver it.</p>  
 <p>"'19. Save me because of my foes, for thou knowest my disgrace, my shame and my dishonour; all my oppressors are before thee.</p>  
 <p>"'20. My heart awaiteth disgrace and misery; I waited for him who should sorrow with me, but I could not come at him, and for him who should comfort me, and I found him not.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'21. They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>  
 <p>"'22. Let their table be unto them for a trap and for a snare and for a retribution and for a stumbling-block.</p>  
 <p>"'23. Mayest thou bend their backs at all time.</p>  
 <p>"'24. Pour out thy anger upon them, and let the wrath of thy anger lay hold upon them.</p>  
 <p>"'25. Let their encampment be desolate, let there be no dweller in their habitations.</p>  
 <p>"'26. For they persecuted him whom thou hast smitten, and added to the smart of their woundings.</p>  
 <p>"'27. They added iniquity to their iniquities; let them not come into |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>55</b>.</font></span> thy righteousness.</p>  
 <p>"'28. Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, and let them not be written in among the righteous.</p>  
 <p>"'29. I am a poor wretch who is heart-broken too; it is the salvation of thy face which hath taken me unto itself.</p>  
 <p>"'30. I will praise the name of God in the ode, and exalt it in the song of thanksgiving.</p>  
 <p>"'31. This shall please God better than a young bull which putteth forth horns and hoofs.</p>  
 <p>"'32. May the wretched see and make merry; seek ye God, that your souls may live.</p>  
 <p>"'33. For God hath heard the wretched and despiseth not the prisoners.</p>  
 <p>"'34. Let heaven and earth praise the Lord, the sea and all that is therein.</p>  
 <p>"'35. For God will save Zion, and the cities of Judæa will be built up, and they will dwell there and inherit it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'36. The seed of his servants shall possess it, and they who love his name shall dwell therein.'"</p>
