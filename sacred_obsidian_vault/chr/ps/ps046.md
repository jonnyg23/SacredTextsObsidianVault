 <p>When then Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, he said unto them: "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear; and let him whose spirit seetheth up in him, come forward and speak the solution of the thought of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Philip the scribe complaineth.</font></span>And when Jesus had finished saying these words, Philip started forward, held up and laid down the book in his hand,--for he is the scribe of all the discourses which Jesus spake, and of all of that which he did,--Philip then |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>70</b>.</font></span> came forward and said unto him: "My Lord, surely then it is not on me alone that thou hast enjoined to take care for the world and write down all</p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>the discourses which we shall speak and [all we shall] do? And thou hast not suffered me to come forward to speak the solution of the mysteries of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. For my spirit hath ofttimes seethed in me and been unloosed and constrained me to come forward and speak the solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia; and I could not come forward because I am the scribe of all the discourses."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus explaineth that the appointed scribes are Philip and Thomas and Matthew.</font></span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Philip, that he said unto him: "Hearken, Philip, blessed one, that I may discourse with thee; for it is thou and Thomas and Matthew on whom it is enjoined by the First Mystery to write all the discourses which I shall speak and [all which I shall] do, and all things which ye shall see. But as for thee, the number of the discourses which thou hast to write, is so far not yet completed. When it is then completed, thou art to come forward and proclaim what pleaseth thee. Now, therefore, ye three have to write down all the discourses which I shall speak and [all things which I shall] do and which ye shall see, in order that ye may bear witness to all things of the kingdom of heaven."</p>
