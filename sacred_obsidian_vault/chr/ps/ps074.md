 <p>It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Thomas came forward, and said: "My Lord, my light-dweller hath ears and my mind hath understood the words which thou hast said. Now, therefore, give commandment unto me to set forth clearly the solution of the words."</p>  
 <p>And the First Mystery answered and said unto Thomas: "I give thee commandment to set forth the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia sang unto me."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Thomas interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon.</font></span>Thomas answered and said: "My Lord, concerning the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, because she was saved out of the chaos, thy light-power prophesied aforetime thereon through Solomon, the son of David, in his Odes:</p>  
 <p>"'1. I am saved |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>150</b>.</font></span> from the bonds and am fled unto thee, O Lord.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'2. For thou hast been on my right hand, saving me and helping me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. Thou hast hindered my adversaries and they have not been revealed, because thy face was with me, saving me in thy grace.</p>  
 <p>"'4. I was despised in the sight of many and cast out; I have become as lead in their sight.</p>  
 <p>"'5. Through thee I have gotten a power which helped me; for thou hast set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me may be without light.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Thou hast overshadowed me with the shadow of thy grace, and I was relieved of the coats of skin.</p>  
 <p>"'7. It is thy right hand which hath raised me up, and thon hast taken the sickness from me.</p>  
 <p>"'8. I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in thy righteousness.</p>  
 <p>"'9. My adversaries have withdrawn themselves from me, and I am justified by thy goodness, for thy rest endureth unto all eternity.'</p>  
 <p>"This then, my Lord, is the solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was saved out of the chaos. Hearken, therefore, that I may say it in openness.</p>  
 <p>"The word then which thy light-power hath spoken through Solomon: 'I am saved from the bonds and am fled unto thee, O Lord,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'I am loosed from the bonds of the darkness and am come unto thee, O Light.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thou wert on my right hand, saving |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>151</b>.</font></span> and helping me,'--it is again the word which Pistis Sophia</p>  
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></a></p>  
 <p>hath spoken: 'Thou art become a light on all sides of me, [saving me] and helping me.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy light-power hath spoken: 'Thou hast hindered my adversaries and they have not been revealed,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And the emanations of Self-willed which fought against me, thou hast hindered through thy light, and they could not come nigh me.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thy face was with me, saving me in thy grace,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'Thy light was with me, saving me in thy light-stream.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'I was despised in the sight of many and cast out,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken:</p>  
 <p>The emanations of Self-willed constrained me and took my power from me, and I have been despised before them and cast out into the chaos, with no light in me.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken:</p>  
 <p>I have become as lead in their sight,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'When they had taken my light from me, I became as heavy-weighing matter before them.'</p>  
 <p>"And moreover the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Through thee |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>152</b>.</font></span> I have gotten a power for me which helped me,'--it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thereafter came a light-power unto me through thee which saved me.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'Thou hast set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me may be without light,'--it</p>  
 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken:</p>  
 <p>'Thy power shone on my right and on my left and surrounded me on all sides of me, so that no part of me was without light.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken:</p>  
 <p>'Thou hast overshadowed me with the shadow of thy grace,'--it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And thou hast covered me with the light of the stream.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: I was relieved of the coats of skin,'--it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And they have purified me of all my evil matters, and I raised myself above them in thy light.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: 'It is thy right hand which hath raised me up, and hath taken the sickness from me,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'And it is thy light-stream which hath raised me up in thy light and hath taken from me the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me.' |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>153</b>.</font></span></p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in thy righteousness,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'I have become powerful in thy light and purified light in thy stream.'</p>  
 <p>And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'My adversaries have withdrawn themselves from me,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'The emanations of Self-willed which constrained me, have withdrawn themselves from me.'</p>  
 <p>"And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: 'And I am justified in thy</p>  
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></a></p>  
 <p>goodness, for thy rest endureth unto all eternity,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: 'I am saved in thy goodness; for thou savest every one.'</p>  
 <p>"This then, O my Lord, is the whole solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was saved out of the chaos and loosed from the bonds of the darkness."</p>
