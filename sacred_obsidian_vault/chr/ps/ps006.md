 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus and his disciples are seated on the Mount of Olives.</font></span>It came to pass then, when the disciples were sitting together on the Mount of Olives, speaking of these words and rejoicing in great joy, and exulting exceedingly and saying one to another: "Blessed are we before all men who are on the earth, because the Saviour hath revealed this unto us, and we have received the Fulness and the total completion,"--they said this to one another, while Jesus sat a little removed from them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">A great light-power descendeth on Jesus.</font></span>And it came to pass then, on the fifteenth day of the moon in the month Tybi, which is the day on which the moon is full, on that day then, when the sun had come forth in his going, that there came forth behind him a great light-power shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light conjoined with it.

 <p>last mystery, which is the four-and-twentieth |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>5</b>.</font></span>mystery, from within without,--those which are in the orders of the second space of the First Mystery. And that light-power came down over Jesus and surrounded him entirely, while he was seated removed from his disciples, and he had shone most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was on him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">It surroundeth him entirely.</font></span>And the disciples had not seen Jesus because of the great light in which he was, or which was about him; for their eyes were darkened because of the great light in which he was. But they saw only the light, which shot forth many light-rays. And the light-rays were not like one another, but the light was of divers kind, and it was of divers type, from below upwards, one [ray] more excellent than the other, . . ., in one great immeasurable glory of light; it stretched from under the earth right up to heaven.--And when the disciples saw that light, they fell into great fear and great agitation.|<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">6.</font></span></p>
