 <p>It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"</p>  
 <p>Andrew came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the solution of the sixth repentance of Pistis Sophia, thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David in the one-hundred-and-twenty-ninth Psalm, saying: |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>75</b>.</font></span></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Andrew interpreteth the sixth repentance from Psalm cxxix.</font></span>"'1. Out of the depths I have cried unto thee, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'2. Hearken unto my voice; let thine ears give heed to the voice of my supplication.</p>  
 <p>"'3. O Lord, if thou heedest my iniquities, who will be able to pass [the test]?</p>  
 <p>"'4. For pardon is in thy hands; for the sake of thy name have I waited for thee, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'5. My soul hath waited for thy word.</p>  
 <p>"'6. My soul hath hoped in the Lord from the morning until the evening. Let Israel hope in the Lord from the morning until the evening.</p>  
 <p>"'7. For grace standeth by the Lord and with him is great redemption.</p>

He promiseth that the tyrants shall be judged and consumed by the wise fire.</font></span>Jesus said unto him: "Well said, Andrew, blessed one. This is the solution of her repentance. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: I will perfect you in all mysteries of the Light and all gnoses from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors, from the Ineffable down to the darkness of darknesses, from the Light of lights down to the . . . . of matter, from all the gods down to the demons, from all the lords down to the decans, from all the authorities down to the servitors, from the creation of men down to [that] of the wild-beasts, of the cattle and of the reptiles, in order that ye may be called perfect, perfected in |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>76</b>.</font></span> all fulness. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: In the region where I shall be in the kingdom of my Father, ye will also be with me. And when the perfect number is completed, so that the Mixture shall be dissolved, I will give commandment that they bring all tyrant gods, who have not given up the purification of their light, and will give commandment to the wise fire, over which the perfect pass, to eat into those tyrants, until they give up the last purification of their light."</p>
