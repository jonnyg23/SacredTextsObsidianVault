 <p>It came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: "Who is sober among you, let him proclaim their solution."</p>  
 <p>James came forward, kissed the breast of Jesus and said: "My Lord, thy spirit hath sobered me, and I am ready to proclaim their solution. Concerning them indeed thy power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the thirty-fourth Psalm, saying thus concerning the ninth repentance of Pistis Sophia:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">James interpreteth the ninth repentance from Psalm xxxiv.</font></span>"'1. Give sentence, O Lord, on them who do me injustice, and fight against them who fight against me.</p>  
 <p>"'2. Lay hand on weapon and shield and stand up to help me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'3. Draw forth a sword and conceal it [<i>sic</i>] from my oppressors. Say unto my soul: I am thy salvation.</p>  
 <p>"'4. Let them be put to shame and abashed who strive after my soul; let them fall back and be put to shame who imagine evil against me.</p>  
 <p>"'5. Let them be as chaff |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>94</b>.</font></span> before the wind, and let the angel of the Lord pursue after them.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Let their way be darkness and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord oppress them.</p>  
 <p>"'7. For without cause have they hid a snare for me for their own spoiling, and they have mocked at my soul in vain.</p>  
 <p>"'8. Let a snare come upon them which they know not, and let the net which they have hid for me, catch them, and let them fall into this snare.</p>  
 <p>"'9. But my soul will exult in the Lord and rejoice in its salvation.</p>  
 <p>"'10. All my bones shall say: O Lord, who can be like unto thee?--thou who settest free the wretched from the hand |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>95</b>.</font></span> of him who is stronger than him; and thou savest a wretched and poor [one] from the hands of them who spoil him.</p>  
 <p>"11. Unjust witnesses came forward and have asked me that which I knew not.</p>  
 <p>"'12. They have requited me evil for good and childlessness for my soul.</p>  
 <p>"13. But when they molested me, I clothed me in a sack and humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer will return into my breast.</p>  
 <p>"'14. I was pleasing unto thee, as unto my neighbour and as unto my brother; and I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>humbled myself as one in mourning and as one who is sad.</p>  
 <p>"'15. They have rejoiced over me, and they are put to shame. Scourges have gathered themselves together against me and I knew not; they were cut off and were troubled.</p>  
 <p>"'16. They have brought me to trial and mocked me with mocking; they have ground |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>96</b>.</font></span> their teeth against me.</p>  
 <p>"'17. O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? Restore again my soul from their evil works and save my only one from the hands of the lions.</p>  
 <p>"'18. I will confess to thee, O Lord, in the great assembly, and I will sing praises to thee in the midst of a countless people.</p>  
 <p>"'19. Let not them who unjustly treat me as a foe, rejoice over me, who hate me without a cause and wink with their eyes.</p>  
 <p>"'20. For indeed they discourse with me with words of peace, though they plot wrath with craft.</p>  
 <p>"'21. They opened their chops wide against me and said: Well indeed, our eyes have filled our sight with him.</p>  
 <p>"'22. Thou hast seen, O Lord. Keep not silence, O Lord, withdraw not thyself from me.</p>  
 <p>"'23. Arise, O Lord, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>97</b>.</font></span> and give heed to my vindication, give heed to my vengeance, my God and my Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'24. Judge me, O Lord, according to thy justice; let them not rejoice over me, my God.</p>  
 <p>"'25. And let them not say: Well done, our soul. Let them not say: We have consumed him.</p>  
 <p>"'26. Let them be put to shame and be scorned, who rejoice at my mischance. Let</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>them be clothed with shame and disgrace who speak boastingly against me.</p>  
 <p>"'27. Let them who desire my justification, exult and rejoice and let them who desire the peace of his slave, say: May the Lord be great and arise.</p>  
 <p>"'28. My tongue will exult over thy justification and over thy honour all the day long.'" |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>98</b>.</font></span></p>
