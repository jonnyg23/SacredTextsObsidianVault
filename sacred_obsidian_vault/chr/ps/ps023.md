 <p>It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words, that he said: "Well said, Mary, for thou art blessed before all women on the earth, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>29</b>.</font></span> because thou shalt be the fulness of all fulnesses and the perfection of all perfections."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus commendeth Mary. She further questioneth him on the changing of the spheres.</font></span>Now when Mary had heard the Saviour speak these words, she exulted greatly, and she came before Jesus, fell down before him, adored his feet and said unto him: "My Lord, hearken unto me, that I may question thee on this word, before that thou discoursest with us about the regions whither thou didst go."</p>  
 <p>Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Discourse in openness and fear not; all things on which thou questionest, I will reveal unto thee."</p>
