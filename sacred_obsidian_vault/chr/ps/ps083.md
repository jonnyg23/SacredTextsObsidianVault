 <p>It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto the disciples, that he said: "Who hath understood the words which I have spoken, let him come forward and set forth their solution."</p>  
 <p>James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this song which Pistis Sophia hath sung, thus thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm:</p>

 <p>"'2. That in sooth he may never steal away my soul as a lion, without any one to deliver and save.</p>  
 <p>"'3. O Lord, my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,</p>  
 <p>"'4. If I have requited those who requite me with evil, then let me fall down empty through my foes.</p>  
 <p>"'5. And let the foe pursue after my soul and seize it, and trample my life to the ground and lay my honour in the dust. (Selah.)</p>  
 <p>"'6. Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, raise thyself up for the end of my foes.</p>  
 <p>"'7. Arise according to the commandment which thou hast commanded.'" |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>173</b>.</font></span></p>
