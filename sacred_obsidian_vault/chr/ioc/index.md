 The 15th century treatise <cite>Of the Imitation of Christ</cite>
 is one of the most popular Christian books of all time.
 Although its authorship was disputed for a long time, it
 is generally now regarded as the product of Thomas a Kempis.
 The work is a manual of devotion assisting the soul in its pursuit
 of holiness and communion with God.
 Written as it was for the monastic life, it presents a high standard
 for spiritual life, and an ideal for devout Christians to aspire to.
 --J.B. Hare
