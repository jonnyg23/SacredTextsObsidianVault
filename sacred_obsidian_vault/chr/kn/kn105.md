 <p>   And thou dost not understand that they were justified by faith—<small>ABRAHAM</small>, and <small>DAVID</small> and all the Prophets, one after the other, who prophesied concerning the coming of the Son of God. And <small>ABRAHAM</small> said, "Wilt Thou in my days, O Lord, cast Thy word upon the ground?" And God said unto him, "By no means. His time hath not yet come, but I will shew thee a similitude of His coming. Get thee over the <small>JORDAN</small>, and dip thyself in the water as thou goest over, and arrive at the city of <small>SÂLÊM</small>, where thou shalt meet <small>MELCHIZEDEK</small>, and I will command him to show thee the sign and similitude of Him." And <small>ABRAHAM</small> did this and he found <small>MELCHIZEDEK</small>, and he gave him the mystery of the bread and wine,<a name="page_200_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_200_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> that same which is celebrated in our Passover for our salvation through our Lord <small>JESUS CHRIST</small>. This was the desire and the joy of <small>ABRAHAM</small> as he went round the altar which <small>MELCHIZEDEK</small> had made, carrying branch and palm on the day of the Sabbath. See how he rejoiced in his belief, and see how he was justified by his belief, O blind <small>JEW</small>, who though having eyes seest not, and having ears hearest not, even as the Prophet <small>ISAIAH</small> saith concerning you, "Their eyes are blind, and their hearts are covered with darkness, so that they may not understand and God may not show compassion unto them."<a name="page_200_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_200_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a></p>
