 <p>   And the city rejoiced because the King had made his son King, and had appointed him King from his own territory to that of another. But the city sorrowed also because the King had commanded that they should give their children who were called "firstborn". And those who were on the right hand should sit in the same way as their fathers sat with King <small>SOLOMON</small>, even so should they sit at the right hand of his son <small>DAVID</small>, the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>; and those who were on the left hand should sit as their fathers sat with King <small>SOLOMON</small>, even so should they sit on the left hand of his son <small>DAVID</small>, the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>; and their rank should be like that of their fathers, and their names should be like those of their fathers. And each should be according to his ordinance, and each according to his greatness, and each according to his position of authority, and each according to his wages, and each according to his rank; in this wise shall they be. As <small>SOLOMON</small> did to his nobles so shall <small>DAVID</small> do to his nobles; and as

 <p>   These are all those who were given to <small>DAVID</small>, king of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, the son of <small>SOLOMON</small>, King of <small>ISRAEL</small>. And <small>SOLOMON</small> also gave him horses, and chariots, and riding-camels, and mules, and wagons for carrying loads, and gold, and silver, and splendid apparel, and byssus, and purple, and gems, and pearls and precious stones; and he gave his son everything that would be wished for in the country of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>.</p>
 
 <p>   And then they made ready to set out, and [though] there was great joy with the nobles of the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, there was sadness with the nobles of the King of <small>ISRAEL</small>, because through the firstborn son of <small>SOLOMON</small>, King of <small>ISRAEL</small>, that is to say, the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, the firstborn sons of the nobles of <small>ISRAEL</small> were given to rule over the country of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> with the son of <small>SOLOMON</small> the King. Then they assembled together and wept, together with their fathers, and their mothers, and their relations, and their kinsfolk, and their peoples, and their countrymen. And they cursed the King secretly and reviled him because he had seized their sons against their will. But unto the King they said, "Because of this thou hast done well. Thy wisdom is so good that the kingdom of <small>ISRAEL</small>, by the Will of God and by thy wisdom, extendeth to the country of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>. And God will gather together the other kingdoms [of the world] into thy hand, for thou hast a right mind towards God, and thou wishest that they shall serve the God of <small>ISRAEL</small>, and that idols may be destroyed out of the world."</p>
 
 <p>   And they praised him and said unto him, "Now know we that God spake concerning thee to our father <small>ABRAHAM</small> [when He said], 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.'" And they made their faces to appear happy, and they jested before him, and they praised him exceedingly (i.e., fulsomely) because of his wisdom. And when they said these things unto him, he understood them in [his] wisdom, and bore with them

 patiently; now God beareth with us patiently knowing well all our sins. And the whole earth, and the heavens, and the ends of the world, and the sea, and the dry land, are the kingdom of God. He judgeth. And He hath given the earth to the king to be subject unto him, that he may judge (or, rule), as He doth, those who do evil so that he may requite them with evil, and those who do good so that he may reward them with good. For the Spirit of God resteth in the heart of the king, and His hands are in his mind, and His knowledge is in his understanding.</p>
