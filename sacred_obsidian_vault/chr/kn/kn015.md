 <p>   And <small>ISAAC</small> his son became king, and he did not transgress the commandment of God; and he was pure in his soul and in his body, and he died in honour. And his son <small>JACOB</small> reigned, and he also did not transgress the commandment of God, and his possessions became numerous, and his children were many; and God blessed him and he died in honour.</p>
