 <p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">by S. Anatolius.</font></p>  
 <p align="center">τὴν ἡμέραν διελθών.</p>  
 <p>This little hymn, which, I believe, is not used in the public service of the Church, is a great favourite in the Greek Isles. Its peculiar style and evident antiquity may well lead to the belief that it is the work of our present author. It is, to the scattered hamlets of Chios and Mitylene, what Bishop Ken's Evening Hymn is to the villages of our own land; and its melody singularly plaintive and soothing.</p>  
 <p>The day is past and over;<br>   All thanks, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, to Thee!<br> I pray Thee, that offenceless<br>   The hours of dark may be.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jesu</span>! keep me in Thy sight,<br>   And save me through the coming night!</p>  
 <p>The joys of day are over:<br>   I lift my heart to Thee;<br> And call on Thee, that sinless<br>   The hours of sin may be.<br> O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jesu</span>! make their darkness light,<br>   And save me through the coming night!</p>  
 <p>The toils of day are over:<br>   I raise the hymn to Thee;<br> And ask that free from peril<br>   The hours of fear may be.<br> O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jesu</span>! keep me in Thy sight,<br>   And guard me through the coming night!</p>  
 <p>Lighten mine eyes, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Saviour</span>,<br>   Or sleep in death shall I;<br> And he, my wakeful tempter,<br>   Triumphantly shall cry: <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a><br> "He could not make their darkness light,<br>  Nor guard them through the hours of night!"</p>  
 <p>Be Thou my soul's preserver,<br>   O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span>! for Thou dost know<br> How many are the perils<br>   Through which I have to go:<br> Lover of men! O hear my call,<br>   And guard and save me from them all!</p>  
 <p>[Set by Mr. Helmore: also by Mr. Arthur Brown. Both settings have reached a second Edition.]</p>
