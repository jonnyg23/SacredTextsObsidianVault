 This is John Nelson Darby's commentary on the Book of Revelation.
 This is the text of the second edition
 (the first edition was published in London in 1839); 
 Material added to the second edition is apparently marked by
 square brackets in the text.
 Note that this book originally had no chapters;
 the internal divisions into 'parts' is arbitrary.
 These divisions were added by the redactor to assist 
 low-bandwidth users of this site.
