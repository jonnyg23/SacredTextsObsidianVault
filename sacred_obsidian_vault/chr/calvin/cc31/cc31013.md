 <p><a name="ix.v-p7"></a><b>21.</b> <i>And the people were waiting</i> Luke now relates that the people were witnesses of this vision. Zacharias had tarried in the temple longer than usual. This leads to the supposition that something uncommon has happened to him. When he comes out, he makes known, by looks and gestures, that he 			 has been struck dumb. There is reason to believe, also, that there were traces of alarm in his countenance. Hence they conclude that God has appeared to him. True, there were few or no visions in that age, but the people remembered that formerly, in the time of their fathers, they were of frequent occurrence. It is not without reason, therefore, that they draw this conclusion from obvious symptoms: for it was not an ordinary occurrence, [it was not a common accident, but rather an astonishing 			 work of God,   			  <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">22</font></a>
  			 ] that he became suddenly dumb without disease, and after a more than ordinary delay came out of the temple in a state of amazement. The word <i>temple, </i>as we have already mentioned, is put for the sanctuary, where the altar of incense stood, (<a name="ix.v-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001">Ex 30:1</a><a name="ix.v-p8.2"></a>.) From this place the priests, after performing their sacred functions, were wont to go out into their own court, for the purpose of blessing the people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p9"></a><a name="ix.v-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p10"></a><b>23.</b> <i>When the days were fulfilled</i> <a name="ix.v-p10.1"></a>Λειτουργία is employed by Luke to denote a charge or office, which passed, as we have said, to each of them in regular order, (<a name="ix.v-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003">1Ch 24:3</a><a name="ix.v-p10.2"></a>.) We are told that, when the time of his office had expired, Zacharias returned home. Hence we conclude that, so long as the priests were attending in their turns, they did not enter their own houses, that they might be entirely devoted and attached to the worship of God. For this purpose galleries were constructed around the walls of the temple, in which they had “chambers,” 			 (<a name="ix.v-p10.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005">1Ki 6:5</a><a name="ix.v-p10.3"></a>.) The law did not, indeed, forbid a priest to enter his house, but, as it did not permit those who ate the show-bread to come near their wives, (<a name="ix.v-p10.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004">1Sa 21:4</a><a name="ix.v-p10.4"></a>,) and as many persons were disposed to treat sacred things in an irreverent manner, this was probably discovered 			 to be a remedy, that, being removed from all temptations, they might preserve themselves pure and clear from every defilement. And they were not only discharged from intercourse with their wives, but from the use of wine and every kind of intoxicating drink, (<a name="ix.v-p10.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009">Le 10:9</a><a name="ix.v-p10.5"></a>.) While they were commanded to change their mode of living, it was advantageous for them 			 not to depart from the temple, that the very sight of the place might remind them to cultivate such purity as the Lord had enjoined. It was proper also to withdraw every means of gratification, that they might devote themselves more unreservedly to their office.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p11"></a>The Papists of the present day employ this as a pretense for defending the tyrannical law of celibacy. They argue thus. The priests were formerly enjoined to withdraw from their wives, while they were engaged in religious services. Most properly is perpetual continence now demanded from the priests, who not in their turn, but every day, offer sacrifices; more especially since the importance of religious services is far higher than it was under 			 the law. But I should like to know why they do not also abstain from wine and strong drink. For we are not at liberty to separate commandments which God has joined, so as to keep the one half and disregard the other. Intercourse with wives is not so expressly forbidden as the drinking of wine, (<a name="ix.v-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021">Eze 44:21</a><a name="ix.v-p11.1"></a>.) If, under the pretense of the law, the Pope enjoins celibacy on his priests, why does he allow them 			 wine? Nay, on this principle, all priests ought to be thrown into some retired apartments of the churches, to pass their whole life immured in prisons, and excluded from the society of women and of the people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p12"></a>It is now abundantly clear that they wickedly shelter themselves under the law of God, to which they do not adhere. But the full solution of the difficulty depends on the distinction between the law and the gospel. A priest stood in the presence of God, to expiate the sins of the people, to be, as it were, a mediator between God and men. He who sustained that character ought to have had something peculiar about him, that he might be 			 distinguished from the common rank of men, and recognised as a figure of the true Mediator. Such, too, was the design of the holy garments and the anointing. In our day the public ministers and pastors of the church have nothing of this description. I speak of the ministers whom Christ has appointed to feed his flock, not of those whom the Pope commissions, as executioners rather than priests, to murder Christ. Let us therefore rest in the decision of the Spirit, which pronounces that “marriage 			 is honorable in all,” (<a name="ix.v-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004">Heb 13:4</a><a name="ix.v-p12.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p13"></a><a name="ix.v-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p14"></a><b>24.</b> <i>And hid herself</i> This appears very strange, as if she had been ashamed of the blessing of God. Some think that she did not, venture to appear in public, so long as the matter was uncertain, for fear of exposing herself to ridicule, if her expectation were disappointed. In my opinion, 			 she was so fully convinced of the promise made to her, that she had no doubt of its accomplishment. When she saw a severe punishment inflicted on her husband for <i>“</i>speaking unadvisedly with his lips,” (<a name="ix.v-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033">Ps 106:33</a><a name="ix.v-p14.1"></a>,) did she, for five successive months, cherish in her mind a similar doubt? 			 But her words show clearly that her expectation was not doubtful or uncertain. By saying, <i>thus hath the Lord done to me, </i>she expressly and boldly affirms that his favor was ascertained. There might be two reasons for the delay. Until this extraordinary work of God was manifest, she might hesitate to expose it to the diversified opinions of men, for the world frequently indulges in 			 light, rash, and irreverent talking about the works of God. Another reason might be that, when she was all at once discovered to be pregnant, men might be more powerfully excited to praise God. [For, when the works of God show themselves gradually, in process of time we make less account of them than if the thing had been accomplished all at once, without our having ever heard of it—<i>Fr</i>.] It was not, therefore, on her own account, but rather with 			 a view to others, that Elisabeth <i>hid herself</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p15"></a><a name="ix.v-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p16"></a><b>25.</b> <i>Thus hath the Lord done to me</i> She extols in private the goodness of God, until the time is fully come for making it generally known. There is reason to believe that her husband had informed her by writing of the promised offspring, in consequence of which she affirms with greater 			 certainty and freedom that God was the author of this favor. This is confirmed by the following words, <i>when he looked, that he might take away my reproach; </i>for she assigns it as the cause of her barrenness that the favor of God had been at that time withdrawn from her. Among earthly blessings, Scripture speaks in the highest terms of the gift of offspring. And justly: for, if the 			 productiveness of the inferior animals is his blessing, the increase and fruitfulness of the human race ought to be reckoned a much higher favor. It is no small or mean honor, that God, who alone is entitled to be regarded as a Father, admits the children of the dust to share with him this title. Let us, therefore, hold this doctrine, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.v-p17"></a>“children are an heritage of the Lord, <br> 			 and the fruit of the womb is his reward,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.v-p17.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003">Ps 127:3</a><a name="ix.v-p17.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p18"></a>But Elisabeth looked farther; for, though barren and old, she had conceived by a remarkable miracle, and contrary to the ordinary course of nature.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p19"></a><i>That he might take away my reproach</i> Not without reason has barrenness been always accounted a <i>reproach: </i>for the blessing of the womb is enumerated among the signal instances of the divine kindness. Some think that this was 			 peculiar to the ancient people: because Christ was to come from the seed of Abraham. But this had no reference, except to the tribe of Judah. Others think more correctly that the multiplication of the holy people was happy and blessed, as was said to Abraham, “I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth,” (<a name="ix.v-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016">Ge 13:16</a><a name="ix.v-p19.1"></a>;) and again,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.v-p20"></a>“Tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: so shall thy seed be,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.v-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005">Ge 15:5</a><a name="ix.v-p20.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p21"></a>But we ought to connect the universal blessing, which extends to the whole human race, with the promise made to Abraham, which is peculiar to the church of God, (<a name="ix.v-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015">Ge 13:15</a><a name="ix.v-p21.1"></a>.) Let parents learn to be thankful to God for the children which he has given them, and let those who have no offspring acknowledge that God has 			 humbled them in this matter. Elisabeth speaks of it exclusively as a reproach <i>among men: </i>for it is a temporal chastisement, from which we will suffer no loss in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
