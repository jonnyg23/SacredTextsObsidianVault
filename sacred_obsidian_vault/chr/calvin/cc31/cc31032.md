 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p9"></a><b>19.</b> <i>But when Herod was dead</i> These words show the perseverance of Joseph’s faith. He kept his feet firm in Egypt, till he was recalled to his native country by a command of God. We see, at the same time, that the Lord never disappoints his own people, but renders them seasonable aid. It 			 is probable that Joseph returned from Egypt immediately after the death of Herod, before Augustus Caesar had issued his decree, appointing Archelaus to be governor of Judea. Having been declared by his father’s will to be successor to the throne, he undertook the whole charge of the government, but abstained from taking the title of king, saying that this depended on the will and pleasure of Caesar. He afterwards went to Rome, and obtained confirmation; only the name of king was refused, until 			 he had merited it by his actions. The governor of Galilee was Philip, a man of gentle disposition, and almost like a private individual. Joseph complied with the suggestion of the angel, because, under a prince who had no delight in shedding blood, and who treated his subjects with mildness, there was less danger.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p10"></a>We must always bear in mind the purpose of God, in training his Son, from the commencement, under the discipline of the cross, because this was the way in which he was to redeem his Church. He bore our infirmities, and was exposed to dangers and to fears, that he might deliver his Church from them by his divine power, and might bestow upon it everlasting peace. His danger was our safety: his fear was our confidence. Not that he ever in his 			 life felt alarm; but as he was surrounded, on every hand, by the fear of Joseph and Mary, he may be justly said to have taken upon him our fears, that he might procure for us assured confidence.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p11"></a><a name="ix.xxiv-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p12"></a><b>23.</b> <i>He shall be called a Nazarene</i> Matthew does not derive <i>Nazarene </i>from <i>Nazareth, </i>as if this were its strict and proper etymology, but only makes an allusion. The word <a name="ix.xxiv-p12.1"></a>נזיר, or <i>Nazarite, </i>signifies <i>holy and devoted to God, </i>and is derived from <a name="ix.xxiv-p12.2"></a>נזר, <i>to separate.</i> The 			 noun <a name="ix.xxiv-p12.3"></a>נזר, indeed, signifies a <i>flower:</i>   			  <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">221</font></a>
  			  but Matthew refers, beyond all doubt, to the former meaning. For we nowhere read that <i>Nazarites</i> meant <i>blooming</i> or <i>flourishing, </i>but persons who were <i>consecrated to God, 			 </i>according to the directions given by the Law, (<a name="ix.xxiv-p13.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001">Nu 6:1-21</a><a name="ix.xxiv-p13.7"></a>) The meaning is: though it was by fear that Joseph was driven into a corner of Galilee, yet God had a higher design, and appointed <i>the city of Nazareth</i> as the place of Christ’s residence, 			 that he might justly be called a <i>Nazarite</i> But it is asked, who are the prophets that gave this name to Christ? for there is no passage to be found that answers to the quotation. Some think it a sufficient answer, that Scripture frequently calls him <i>Holy: </i>but that 			 is a very poor explanation. For Matthew, as we perceive, makes an express reference to the very word, and to the ancient Nazarites, whose holiness was of a peculiar character. He tells us, that what was then shadowed out in the Nazarites, who were, in some sense, selected as the first-fruits to God, must have been fulfilled in the person of Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p14"></a>But it remains to be seen, in what part of Scripture the prophets have stated that this name would be given to Christ. Chrysostom, finding himself unable to loose the knot, cuts it by saying, that many books of the prophets have perished. But this answer has no probability: for, though the Lord, in order to punish the indifference of his ancient people, deprived them of some part of Scripture, or left out what was less necessary, yet, since 			 the coming of Christ, no part of it has been lost. In support of that view, a strange blunder has been made, by quoting a passage of Josephus, in which he states that Ezekiel left two books: for Ezekiel’s prophecy of a new temple and kingdom is manifestly distinct from his other predictions, and may be said to form a new work. But if all the books of Scripture which were extant in the time of Matthew, remain entire to the present day, we must find somewhere the passage quoted from the 			 prophets.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p15"></a><i>Bucer</i>  			  <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">222</font></a>
  			  has explained it, I think, more correctly than any other writer. He thinks that the reference is to a passage in the Book of Judges: <i>The child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb, </i>(<a name="ix.xxiv-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005">Jud 13:5</a><a name="ix.xxiv-p16.1"></a>.) These words, no doubt, were spoken with regard to Samson. But Samson is called the “Redeemer” or “Deliverer”  			  <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">223</font></a>
  			 of the people, only because he was a figure of Christ, and because the salvation, which was accomplished by his instrumentality, was a sort of prelude of the full salvation, which was at length exhibited to the world by the Son of God.  			  <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">224</font></a>
  			 All that Scripture predicts, in a favorable manner, about Samson, may justly be applied to Christ. To express it more clearly, Christ is the original model: Samson is the inferior antitype.  			  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">225</font></a>
  			 When he assumed the character of a <i>Redeemer,</i>  			  <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">226</font></a>
  			  we ought to understand, that none of the titles bestowed on that illustrious and truly divine office apply so strictly to himself as to Christ: for the fathers did but taste the grace of redemption, which we have been permitted to receive fully in Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxiv-p21"></a>Matthew uses the word <i>prophets</i> in the plural number. This may easily be excused: for the Book of Judges was composed by many <i>prophets. </i>But I think that what is here said about <i>the 			 prophets</i> has a still wider reference. For Joseph, who was a temporal Savior of the Church, and was, in many respects, a figure, or rather a lively image of Christ, is called <i>a Nazarite of his brethren,</i>   			  <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">227</font></a>
  			  (<a name="ix.xxiv-p22.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026">Ge 49:26</a><a name="ix.xxiv-p22.4"></a>; <a name="ix.xxiv-p22.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016">De 33:16</a><a name="ix.xxiv-p22.5"></a>.) God determined that the distinguished honor, of which he had given a specimen in Joseph, should shine again in Samson, and gave him the name of <i>Nazarite, 			 </i>that believers, having received those early instructions, might look more earnestly at the Redeemer who was to come, who was to be <i>separated</i> from all,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.xxiv-p23"></a>“That he might be the first-born among many brethren,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xxiv-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029">Ro 8:29</a><a name="ix.xxiv-p23.2"></a>.)</p>
