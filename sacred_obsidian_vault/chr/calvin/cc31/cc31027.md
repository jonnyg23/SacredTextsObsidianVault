 <p><a name="ix.xix-p8"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Now when Jesus had been born</i> How it came about that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Matthew does not say. The Spirit of God, who had appointed the Evangelists to be his clerks,   			  <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>
  			  appears purposely to have regulated their style in such a manner, that they all wrote one and the same history, with the most perfect agreement, but in different ways. It was intended, that the truth of God should more clearly and strikingly appear, when it was manifest that his witnesses did not speak by a preconcerted plan, but that each of them separately, without paying any attention to another, wrote freely and honestly what the Holy Spirit dictated.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p10"></a>This is a very remarkable narrative. God brought <i>Magi </i>from Chaldea, to come to the land of Judea, for the purpose of adoring Christ, in the stable where he lay, amidst the tokens, not of honor, but of contempt. It was a truly wonderful purpose of God, that he caused the entrance of his Son into the world to be attended by deep meanness, and yet bestowed upon him illustrious ornaments, both of commendation and of other outward signs, 			 that our faith might be supplied with everything necessary to prove his Divine Majesty.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p11"></a>A beautiful instance of real harmony, amidst apparent contradiction, is here exhibited. A star from heaven announces that he is a king, to whom a manger, intended for cattle, serves for a throne, because he is refused admittance among the lowest of the people. His majesty shines in the East, while in Judea it is so far from being acknowledged, that it is visited by many marks of dishonor. Why is this? The heavenly Father chose to appoint the 			 star and the Magi as our guides, to lead directly to his Son: while he stripped him of all earthly splendor, for the purpose of informing us that his kingdom is spiritual. This history conveys profitable instruction, not only because God brought the <i>Magi </i>to his Son, as the first-fruits of the Gentiles, but also because he appointed the kingdom of his Son to receive their commendation, and that of the star, for the confirmation of our faith; that the wicked and malignant contempt of his 			 nation might not render him less estimable in our eyes.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p12"></a><i>Magi</i> is well known to be the name given by the Persians and Chaldees to astrologers and philosophers: and hence it may readily be conjectured that those men came from Persia.   			  <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
  			  As the Evangelist does not state what was their number, it is better to be ignorant of it, than to affirm as certain what is doubtful. Papists have been led into a childish error, of supposing that they were <i>three </i>in number: because Matthew says, that they brought <i>gold, frankincense, and myrrh, </i>(<a name="ix.xix-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011">Mt 2:11</a><a name="ix.xix-p13.3"></a>.) But the historian does not say, that each of them separately presented his own gift. He rather says, that those three gifts were presented by them in common. That ancient author, whoever he may be, whose imperfect Commentary on Matthew bears the name of Chrysostom, and is reckoned among Chrysostom’s works, says that they were fourteen. This carries as little 			 probability as the other. It may have come from a tradition of the Fathers, but has no solid foundation. But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is, that those men were kings, because they found in another passage a prediction, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.xix-p14"></a>the kings of Tarshish, and of the Isles, and of Sheba, <br> 			 would offer gifts to the Lord, (<a name="ix.xix-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010">Ps 72:10</a><a name="ix.xix-p14.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p15"></a>Ingenious workmen, truly, who, in order to present those men in a new shape, have begun with turning the world from one side to another: for they have changed the south and west into <i>the east! </i>Beyond all doubt, they have been stupified by a righteous judgment of God, that all might laugh at the gross ignorance of those who have not scrupled to adulterate “and, change the truth of God into a lie,” (<a name="ix.xix-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025">Ro 1:25</a><a name="ix.xix-p15.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p16"></a><i>The first</i> inquiry here is: Was this <i>star </i>one of those which the Lord created<i> in the beginning</i> (<a name="ix.xix-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001">Gen. 1:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016">16</a><a name="ix.xix-p16.1"></a>) to “garnish 			 the heavens?” (<a name="ix.xix-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013">Job 26:13</a><a name="ix.xix-p16.2"></a>.) <i>Secondly, </i>Were the <i>magi </i>led by their acquaintance with astrology to conclude that it pointed out the birth of Christ? On these points, there is no necessity for angry disputation: but it may be inferred from the words of Matthew, that it 			 was not a natural, but an extraordinary star. It was not agreeable to the order of nature, that it should disappear for a certain period, and afterwards should suddenly become bright; nor that it should pursue a straight course towards Bethlehem, and at length remain stationary above the house where Christ was. Not one of these things belongs to natural stars. It is more probable that it resembled   			  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">179</font></a>
  			  a comet, and was seen, not in the heaven, but in the air. Yet there is no impropriety in Matthew, who uses popular language, calling it incorrectly a <i>star.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p18"></a>This almost decides likewise the second question: for since astrology is undoubtedly confined within the limits of nature, its guidance alone could not have conducted the <i>Magi </i>to Christ; so that they must have been aided by a secret revelation of the Spirit. I do not go so far as to say, that they derived no assistance whatever from the art: but I affirm, that this would have been of no practical advantage, if they had not been aided 			 by a new and extraordinary revelation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p19"></a><a name="ix.xix-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p20"></a><b>2. </b><i>Where is he who has been born King? </i>The notion of some commentators, that he is said to have been <i>born King, </i>by indirect contrast with one who has been <i>made </i>or <i>created </i>a king, appears to me too trifling. I rather suppose the <i>Magi</i> to have simply meant, that this king had been recently born, and was still a child, by way of distinguishing him from a king who is of age, and who holds the reins of government: for they immediately add, that they had been drawn, not by the fame of his exploits, or by any present exhibitions of his 			 greatness, but by a heavenly presage of his future reign. But if the sight of a star had so powerful an effect on the <i>Magi, </i>woe to our insensibility, who, now that Christ the King has been revealed to us, are so cold in our inquiries after him!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p21"></a><i>And have come that we may worship him</i> The reason why the <i>star </i>had been exhibited was, to draw the <i>Magi</i> into Judea, that they might be witnesses and heralds of the new 			 King.   			  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  			  So far as respects themselves, they had not come to render to Christ such pious worship, as is due to the Son of God, but intended to salute him, according to the Persian custom,   			  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  			  as a very eminent King. For their views, with regard to him, probably went no farther, than that his power and exalted rank would be so extraordinary as to impress all nations with just admiration and reverence. It is even possible, that they wished to gain his favor beforehand, that he might treat them favorably and kindly, if he should afterwards happen to possess dominion in the east.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p24"></a><a name="ix.xix-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p25"></a><b>3. </b><i>Herod the king was troubled</i> Herod was not unacquainted with the predictions, which promised to the Jews a King, who would restore their distressful and ruinous affairs to a prosperous condition. He had lived from a child among that nation, and was thoroughly acquainted with their affairs. Besides, the 			 report was spread everywhere, and could not be unknown to the neighboring nations. Yet he is <i>troubled, </i>as if the matter had been new and unheard of; because he put no trust in God, and thought it idle to rely on the promises of a Redeemer; and particularly because, with the foolish confidence incident to proud men, he imagined that the kingdom was secure to himself and his descendants. But though, in the intoxication of prosperity, he was 			 formerly accustomed to view the prophecies with scorn, the recollection of them now aroused him to sudden alarm. For he would not have been so strongly moved by the simple tale of the <i>Magi, </i>if he had not remembered the predictions, which he had formerly looked upon as harmless,   			  <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  			  and of no importance. Thus, when the Lord has permitted unbelievers to sleep, he suddenly breaks their rest.   			  <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p28"></a><i>And all Jerusalem with him</i> This may be explained in two ways. Either the people were roused, in a tumultuous manner, by the novelty of the occurrence, though the glad tidings of a king who had been born to them were cordially welcomed. Or the people, accustomed to distresses, and rendered callous by long endurance, dreaded a change 			 which might introduce still greater calamities. For they were so completely worn down, and almost wasted, by continued wars, that their wretched and cruel bondage appeared to them not only tolerable, but desirable, provided it were accompanied by peace. This shows how little they had profited under God’s chastisements: for they were so benumbed and stupified, that the promised redemption and salvation almost stank   			  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
  			  in their nostrils. Matthew intended, I have no doubt, to express their ingratitude, in being so entirely broken by the long continuance of their afflictions, as to throw away the hope and desire of the grace which had been promised to them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p30"></a><a name="ix.xix-p30.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p31"></a><b>4. </b><i>Having assembled the priests</i> Though deep silence prevailed respecting Christ in the Hall of Herod, yet, as soon as the <i>Magi</i> have thrown out the mention of a <i>King, </i>predictions are remembered, which formerly lay in oblivion. Herod instantly conjectures, that the <i>King, </i>about whom the <i>Magi</i> inquire, is the <i>Messiah</i> whom God had formerly promised, (<a name="ix.xix-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025">Da 9:25</a><a name="ix.xix-p31.1"></a>.) Here again it appears, that Herod is seriously alarmed, when he puts such earnest inquiries; and no wonder. All tyrants are cowards, and their cruelty produces stronger alarm in their own breasts than in the breasts of others. Herod must 			 have trembled more than others, because he perceived that he was reigning in opposition to God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p32"></a>This new investigation shows, that the contempt of Christ, before the arrival of the <i>Magi, </i>must have been very deep. At a later period, the scribes and high priests labored with fury to corrupt the whole of the Scripture, that they might not give any countenance to Christ. But on the present occasion they reply 			 honestly out of the Scripture, and for this reason, that Christ and his Gospel have not yet given them uneasiness. And so all ungodly persons find no difficulty in giving their assent to God on general principles; but when the truth of God begins to press them more closely, they throw out the venom of their rebellion.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p33"></a>We have a striking instance of this, in our own day, among the Papists. They freely own, that he is the only-begotten Son of God, clothed with our flesh, and acknowledge the one person of God-man, as subsisting in the two natures. But when we come to the power and office of Christ, a contest immediately breaks out; because they will not consent to take a lower rank, and much less to be reduced to nothing. In a word, so long as wicked men 			 think that it is taking nothing from themselves, they will yield to God and to Scripture some degree of reverence. But when Christ comes into close conflict with ambition, covetousness, pride, misplaced confidence, hypocrisy, and deceit, they immediately forget all modesty, and break out into rage. Let us therefore learn, that the chief cause of blindness in the enemies of truth is to be found in their wicked affections, which change light into darkness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p34"></a><a name="ix.xix-p34.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p35"></a><b>6. </b><i>And thou, Bethlehem</i> The scribes quoted faithfully, no doubt, the words of the passage in their own language, as it is found in the prophet. But Matthew reckoned it enough to point out the passage; and, as he wrote in Greek, he followed the ordinary reading. This passage, and others of the same kind, readily 			 suggest the inference, that Matthew did not compose his Gospel in the Hebrew language. It ought always to be observed that, whenever any proof from Scripture is quoted by the apostles, though they do not translate word for word, and sometimes depart widely from the language, yet it is applied correctly and appropriately to their subject. Let the reader always consider the purpose for which passages of Scripture are brought forward by the Evangelists, so as not to stick too closely to the 			 particular words, but to be satisfied with this, that the Evangelists never torture Scripture into a different meaning, but apply it correctly in its native meaning. But while it was their intention to supply with milk children and “novices” (<a name="ix.xix-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006">1Ti 3:6</a><a name="ix.xix-p35.1"></a>) in faith, who were not yet able to endure <i>“</i>strong meat,” (<a name="ix.xix-p35.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012">Heb 5:12</a><a name="ix.xix-p35.2"></a>,) there is nothing to prevent the children of God from making careful and diligent inquiry into the meaning of Scripture, and thus being led to the fountain by the taste which the apostles afford.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p36"></a>Let us now return to the prediction. Thus it stands literally in the Prophet:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.xix-p37"></a>“And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little <br> 			 among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall <br> 			 he come forth to me, who is Ruler in Israel,” (<a name="ix.xix-p37.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</a><a name="ix.xix-p37.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xix-p38"></a>For <i>Ephratah</i> Matthew has put <i>Judah, </i>but the meaning is the same; for Micah only intended, by this mark, to distinguish the Bethlehem of which he speaks, from another Bethlehem, which was in the 			 tribe of Zebulun. There is greater difficulty in what follows: for the Prophet says, that Bethlehem is <i>little, </i>when reckoned among the governments of Judah, while Matthew, on the contrary: speaks highly of its rank as one of the most distinguished: <i>thou art by no means the least among the princes of Judah</i> This reason has induced 			 some commentators to read the passage in the prophet as a question, <i>Art thou little among the thousands of Judah? </i>But I rather agree with those who think that Matthew intended, by this change of the language, to magnify the grace of God in making an inconsiderable and unknown town the birth-place of the highest King. Although Bethlehem received this distinguished honor, it was of 			 no advantage to its inhabitants, but brought upon them a heavier destruction: for there an unworthy reception was given to the Redeemer. For he is <i>to be Ruler, </i>Matthew has put <i>he shall feed, </i>(<a name="ix.xix-p38.1"></a>ποιμανεῖ) But he has expressed both, when he says, that Christ is the <i>leader, (</i><a name="ix.xix-p38.2"></a>ἡγούμενος<i>,) </i>and that to him is committed the office of <i>feeding </i>his people.</p>

Of astrology he speaks more doubtfully. If he had lent the countenance of his name to that pretended science, we ought not to have blamed him severely. Long after he had left the world, men of powerful minds, and of extensive attainments in science, found it no easy matter to disentangle themselves from its meshes, and to proclaim their freedom.
