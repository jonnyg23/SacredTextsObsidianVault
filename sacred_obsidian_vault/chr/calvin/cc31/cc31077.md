He represents two 			 houses, one of which was built without a foundation, while the other was well-founded. Both have the same external appearance: but, when the wind and storms blow, and the floods dash against them, the former will immediately fall, while the latter will be sustained by its strength against every assault. Christ therefore compares a vain and empty profession of the Gospel to a beautiful, but not solid, building, which, however elevated, is exposed every moment to downfall, because it wants a 			 foundation. Accordingly, Paul enjoins us to be well and thoroughly founded on Christ, and to have deep roots, (<a name="ix.lxix-p8.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007">Col 2:7</a><a name="ix.lxix-p8.3"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.lxix-p9"></a>“that we may not be tossed and driven about by every wind of doctrine,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.lxix-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14</a><a name="ix.lxix-p9.2"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.lxix-p10"></a>that we may not give way at every attack. The general meaning of the passage is, that true piety is not fully distinguished from its counterfeit,  			  <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">485</font></a>
  			 till it comes to the trial. For the temptations, by which we are tried, are like billows and storms, which easily overwhelm unsteady minds, whose lightness is not perceived during the season of prosperity.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.lxix-p12"></a><i>Who heareth these sayings</i>  The relative <i>these </i>denotes not one class of sayings, but the whole amount of doctrine. He means, that the Gospel, if it be not deeply rooted in the mind, is like a wall, which has been raised to a great height, but does not rest on 			 any foundation. “That faith (he says) is true, which has its roots deep in the heart, and rests on an earnest and steady affection as its foundation, that it may not give way to temptations.” For such is the vanity of the human mind, that all build upon the sand, who do not dig so deep as to deny themselves.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.lxix-p14"></a><b>28. </b><i>When Jesus had finished these sayings</i>  By <i>these sayings </i>I understand not only the discourse which he delivered when he came down from the mountain, but the rest of the doctrine, which had already been made known to the people. The 			 meaning therefore is, that, where he had given the people, on all sides, a taste of his doctrine, all were seized with astonishment, because a strange, indescribable, and unwonted majesty drew to him the minds of men. What is meant by his <i>teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes, </i>I have already explained.   			  <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">486</font></a>
