 <p><a name="xxv-p3"></a>David, with the view of encouraging the faithful to contemplate the glory of God, sets before them in the first place, a mirror of it in the fabric of the heavens, and in the exquisite order of their workmanship which we behold; and in the second place, he recalls our thoughts to the Law, in which God made himself more familiarly known to his chosen people. Taking occasion from this, he continues to discourse at considerable length on this peculiar 		  gift of Heaven, commending and exalting the use of the law. Finally, he concludes the psalm with a prayer.</p>  <a name="xxv.i"></a>

  			  I have already said, that this psalm consists of two parts, in the first of which David celebrates the glory of God as manifested in his works; and, in the other, exalts and magnifies the knowledge of God which shines forth more clearly in his word. He only makes mention of the heavens; but, under this part of creation, which is the noblest, and the excellency of which is more conspicuous, he doubtless includes by synecdoche the whole fabric 			 of the world. There is certainly nothing so obscure or contemptible, even in the smallest corners of the earth, in which some marks of the power and wisdom of God may not be seen; but as a more distinct image of him is engraven on the heavens, David has particularly selected them for contemplation, that their splendor might lead us to contemplate all parts of the world. When a man, from beholding and contemplating the heavens, has been brought to acknowledge God, he will learn also to reflect 			 upon and to admire his wisdom and power as displayed on the face of the earth, not only in general, but even in the minutest plants. In the first verse, the Psalmist repeats one thing twice, according to his usual manner. He introduces the heavens as witnesses and preachers of the glory of God, attributing to the dumb creature a quality which, strictly speaking, does not belong to it, in order the more severely to upbraid men for their ingratitude, if they should pass over so clear a testimony 			 with unheeding ears. This manner of speaking more powerfully moves and affects us than if he had said, The heavens <i>show </i>or <i>manifest </i>the glory of God. It is indeed a great thing, that in the splendor of the heavens there is presented to our view a lively image of God; but, as the living voice has a greater effect in exciting our attention, or at least teaches us more surely and with greater profit 			 than simple beholding, to which no oral instruction is added, we ought to mark the force of the figure which the Psalmist uses when he says, that the heavens by their preaching declare the glory of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.i-p9"></a>The repetition which he makes in the second clause is merely an explanation of the first. David shows how it is that the heavens proclaim to us the glory of God, namely, by openly bearing testimony that they have not been put together by chance, but were wonderfully created by the supreme Architect. When we behold the heavens, we cannot but be elevated, by the contemplation of them, to Him who is their great Creator; and the beautiful 			 arrangement and wonderful variety which distinguish the courses and station of the heavenly bodies, together with the beauty and splendor which are manifest in them, cannot but furnish us with an evident proof of his providence. Scripture, indeed, makes known to us the time and manner of the creation; but the heavens themselves, although God should say nothing on the subject, proclaim loudly and distinctly enough that they have been fashioned by his hands: and this of itself abundantly suffices 			 to bear testimony to men of his glory. As soon as we acknowledge God to be the supreme Architect, who has erected the beauteous fabric of the universe, our minds must necessarily be ravished with wonder at his infinite goodness, wisdom, and power.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.i-p11"></a><b>2.</b> <i>Day unto day uttereth speech.</i> Philosophers, who have more penetration into those matters than others, understand how the stars are arranged in such beautiful order, that notwithstanding their immense number there is no confusion; but to the ignorant and unlettered, the continual 			 succession of days is a more undoubted proof of the providence of God. David, therefore, having spoken of the heavens, does not here descend from them to other parts of the world; but, from an effect more sensible and nearer our apprehension, he confirms what he has just now said, namely, that the glory of God not only shines, but also resounds in the heavens. The words may be variously expounded, but the different expositions which have been given of them make little difference as to the 			 sense. Some explain them thus, that no day passes in which God does not show some signal evidence of his power. Others are of opinion that they denote the augmentations of instruction and knowledge, - that every succeeding day contributes something new in proof of the existence and perfections of God. Others view them as meaning that the days and nights talk together, and reason concerning the glory of their Creator’, but this is a somewhat forced interpretation. David, I have no doubt, here 			 teaches, from the established alternations of days and nights, that the course and revolutions of the sun, and moon, and stars, are regulated by the marvellous wisdom of God. Whether we translate the words <i>Day after day, </i>or <i>one day to another day, </i>is of little consequence; for all that David means is the beautiful arrangement of time which the succession of days and nights effects. If, indeed, we 			 were as attentive as we ought to be, even one day would suffice to bear testimony to us of the glory of God, and even one night would be sufficient to perform to us the same office. But when we see the sun and the moon performing their daily revolutions, — the sun by day appearing over our heads, and the moon succeeding in its turns — the sun ascending by degrees, while at the same time he approaches nearer us, — and afterwards bending his course so as to depart from us by little and little; — 			 and when we see that by this means the length of the days and nights is regulated, and that the variation of their length is arranged according to a law so uniform, as invariably to recur at the same points of time in every successive year, we have in this a much brighter testimony to the glory of God. David, therefore, with the highest reason, declares, that although God should not speak a single word to men, yet the orderly and useful succession of days and nights eloquently proclaims the 			 glory of God, and that there is now left to men no pretext for ignorance; for since the days and nights perform towards us so well and so carefully the office of teachers, we may acquire, if we are duly attentive, a sufficient amount of knowledge under their tuition.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.i-p13"></a><b>3.</b> <i>There is no language nor speech [where] their voice is not heard.</i> This verse receives two almost contrary interpretations, each of which, however, has the appearance of probability. As the words, when rendered literally, read thus — <i>No language, and no words, their voice is not heard</i> — some connect the third and fourth verses together, as if this sentence were incomplete without the clause which follows in the beginning of the fourth verse, <i>Their writing has gone forth through all the earth, </i>etc. According to them, the meaning is this:— 			 The heavens, it is true, are mute and are not endued with the faculty of speech; but still they proclaim the glory of God with a voice sufficiently loud and distinct. But if this was David’s meaning, what need was there to repeat three times that they have not articulate speech? It would certainly be spiritless and superfluous to insist so much upon a thing so universally known. The other exposition, therefore, as it is more generally received, seems also to be more suitable. In the Hebrew 			 tongue, which is concise, it is often necessary to supply some word; and it is particularly a common thing in that language for the relatives to be omitted, that is to say, the words <i>which, in which, </i>etc., as here, <i>There is no language, there is no speech, </i>[<i>where</i>   			  <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">445</font></a>
  			 ]<i> their voice is not heard.</i>   			  <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">446</font></a>
  			  Besides, the third negation, <a name="xxv.i-p15.2"></a>בלי, <i>beli,</i>   			  <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">447</font></a>
  			  rather denotes an exception to what is stated in the preceding members of the sentence, as if it had been said, The difference and variety of languages does not prevent the preaching of the heavens and their language from being heard and understood in every quarter of the world. The difference of languages is a barrier which prevents different nations from maintaining mutual intercourse, and it makes him who in his own country is distinguished for his eloquence, 			 when he comes into a foreign country either dumb or, if he attempt to speak, barbarous. And even although a man could speak all languages, he could not speak to a Grecian and a Roman at the same time; for as soon as he began to direct his discourse to the one, the other would cease to understand him. David, therefore, by making a tacit comparison, enhances the efficacy of the testimony which the heavens bear to their Creator. The import of his language is, Different nations differ from each 			 other as to language; but the heavens have a common language to teach all men without distinction, nor is there any thing but their own carelessness to hinder even those who are most strange to each other, and who live in the most distant parts of the world, from profiting, as it were, at the mouth of the same teacher.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.i-p17"></a><b>4.</b><i> Their writing has gone forth, etc.</i> Here the inspired writer declares how the heavens preach to all nations indiscriminately, namely, because men, in all countries and in all parts of the earth, may understand that the heavens are set before their eyes as witnesses to bear testimony 			 to the glory of God. As the Hebrew word <a name="xxv.i-p17.2"></a>קו, <i>kav signifies </i>sometimes <i>a line, </i>and sometimes <i>a building, </i>some deduce from it this meaning, that the fabric of the heavens being framed in a regular manner, and as it were by line, proclaims the 			 glory of God in all parts of the world. But as David here metaphorically introduces the splendor and magnificence of the heavenly bodies, as preaching the glory of God like a teacher in a seminary of learning, it would be a meagre and unsuitable manner of speaking to say, that the line of the heavens goes forth to the uttermost ends of the earth. Besides, he immediately adds, in the following clause, that <i>their words </i>are every where heard; but 			 what relation is there between words and the beauty of a building? If, however, we render <a name="xxv.i-p17.3"></a>קו, <i>kav, writing, </i>these two things will very well agree, first, that the glory of God is written and imprinted in the heavens, as in an open volume which all men may read; and, secondly, that, at the same time, they give forth a loud and distinct voice, 			 which reaches the ears of all men, and causes itself to be heard in all places.   			  <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">448</font></a>
  			  Thus we are taught, that the language of which mention has been made before is, as I may term it, a visible language, in other words, language which addresses itself to the sight; for it is to the eyes of men that the heavens speak, not to their ears; and thus David justly compares the beautiful order and arrangement, by which the heavenly bodies are distinguished, to a writing. That the Hebrew word <a name="xxv.i-p18.2"></a>קו, <i>kav, </i>signifies a line in writing,   			  <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">449</font></a>
  			  is sufficiently evident from <a name="xxv.i-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010">Isa 28:10</a><a name="xxv.i-p19.2"></a>, where God, comparing the Jews to children who are not yet of sufficient age to make great proficiency, speaks thus:</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xxv.i-p20"></a>“For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.i-p21"></a>In my judgment, therefore, the meaning is, that the glory of God is not written in small obscure letters, but richly engraven in large and bright characters, which all men may read, and read with the greatest ease. Hitherto I have explained the true and proper meaning of the inspired writer. Some have wrested this part of the psalm by putting upon it an allegorical interpretation; but my readers will easily perceive that 			 this has been done without reason. I have shown in the commencement, and it is also evident from the scope of the whole discourse, that David, before coming to the law, sets before us the fabric of the world, that in it we might behold the glory of God. Now, if we understand the heavens as meaning the apostles, and the sun Christ, there will be no longer place for the division of which we have spoken; and, besides, it would be an improper arrangement to place the gospel first and then the law. 			 It is very evident that the inspired poet here treats of the knowledge of God, which is naturally presented to all men in this world as in a mirror; and, therefore, I forbear discoursing longer on that point. As, however, these allegorical interpreters have supported their views from the words of Paul, this difficulty must be removed. Paul, in discoursing upon the calling of the Gentiles, lays down this as an established principle, that, “Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, 			 shall be saved;” and then he adds, that it is impossible for any to call upon him until they know him by the teaching of the gospel. But as it seemed to the Jews to be a kind of sacrilege that Paul published the promise of salvation to the Gentiles, he asks whether the Gentiles themselves had not heard? And he answers, by quoting this passage, that there was a school open and accessible to them, in which they might learn to fear God, and serve him, inasmuch as “the writing  			  <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">450</font></a>
  			 of the heavens has gone forth <i>through all the earth, </i>and their words unto the ends of the world,” (<a name="xxv.i-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018">Ro 10:18</a><a name="xxv.i-p22.2"></a>.) But Paul could not at that time have said with truth, that the voice of the gospel had been heard through the whole world from the mouth of the apostles, since it had scarcely as yet reached even a few countries. The preaching of the other apostles certainly had not then extended to 			 far distant parts of the world, but was confined within the boundaries of Judea. The design of the apostle it is not difficult to comprehend. He intended to say that God, from ancient times, had manifested his glory to the Gentiles, and that this was a prelude to the more ample instruction which was one day to be published to them. And although God’s chosen people for a time had been in a condition distinct and separate from that of the Gentiles, it ought not to be thought strange that God at 			 length made himself known indiscriminately to both, seeing he had hitherto united them to himself by certain means which addressed themselves in common to both; as Paul says in another passage, that when God,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xxv.i-p23"></a>“in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, he nevertheless left not himself without a witness,” <br> 			 (<a name="xxv.i-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016">Acts 14:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017">17</a><a name="xxv.i-p23.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.i-p24"></a>Whence we conclude, that those who have imagined that Paul departed from the genuine and proper sense of David’s words are grossly mistaken. The reader will understand this still more clearly by reading my commentaries on the above passage of St. Paul.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.i-p25"></a><i>He hath set in them a tabernacle [or pavilion] for the sun.</i> As David, out of the whole fabric of the world, has especially chosen the heavens, in which he might exhibit to our view an image of God, because there it is more distinctly to be seen, even as a man is better seen when set on an elevated stage; so now he shows us the sun as 			 placed in the highest rank, because in his wonderful brightness the majesty of God displays itself more magnificently than in all the rest. The other planets, it is true, have also their motions, and as it were the appointed places within which they run their race,   			  <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">451</font></a>
  			  and the firmament, by its own revolution, draws with it all the fixed stars, but it would have been lost time for David to have attempted to teach the secrets of astronomy to the rude and unlearned; and therefore he reckoned it sufficient to speak in a homely style, that he might reprove the whole world of ingratitude, if, in beholding the sun, they are not taught the fear and the knowledge of God. This, then, is the reason why he says that a tent or pavilion has 			 been erected for the sun, and also why he says, that he goes forth from one end of the heaven, and quickly passes to the other and opposite end. He does not here discourse scientifically (as he might have done, had he spoken among philosophers) concerning the entire revolution which the sun performs, but, accommodating himself to the rudest and dullest, he confines himself to the ordinary appearances presented to the eye, and, for this reason, he does not speak of the other half of the sun’s 			 course, which does not appear in our hemisphere. He proposes to us three things to be considered in the sun, — the splendor and excellency of his forms — the swiftness with which he runs his course, — and the astonishing power of his heat. The more forcibly to express and magnify his surpassing beauty and, as it were, magnificent attire, he employs the similitude of a bridegroom. He then adds another similitude, that of a valiant man who enters the lists as a racer to carry off the prize of the 			 course. The swiftness of those who in ancient times contended in the stadium, whether on chariots or on foot, was wonderful; and although it was nothing when compared with the velocity with which the sun moves in his orbit, yet David, among all that he saw coming under the ordinary notice of men, could find nothing which approached nearer to it. Some think that the third clause, where he speaks of the heat of the sun, is to be understood of his vegetative heat, as it is called; in other words, 			 that by which the vegetating bodies which are in the earth have their vigor, support, and growth.   			  <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">452</font></a>
  			  But I do not think that this sense suits the passage. It is, indeed, a wonderful work of God, and a signal evidence of his goodness, that the powerful influence of the sun penetrating the earth renders it fruitful. But as the Psalmist says, that <i>no man </i>or <i>nothing is hidden from his heat, </i>I am rather 			 inclined to understand it of the violent heat which scorches men and other living creatures as well as plants and trees. With respect to the enlivening heat of the sun, by which we feel ourselves to be invigorated, no man desires to avoid it.</p>  <a name="xxv.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p8"></a><b>7.</b><i> The law of the Lord.</i> Here the second part of the psalm commences. After having shown that the creatures, although they do not speak, nevertheless serve as instructors to all mankind, and teach all men so clearly that there is a God, as to render them inexcusable, the Psalmist now turns towards the Jews, to 			 whom God had communicated a fuller knowledge of himself by means of his word. While the heavens bear witness concerning God, their testimony does not lead men so far as that thereby they learn truly to fear him, and acquire a well-grounded knowledge of him; it serves only to render them inexcusable. It is doubtless true, that if we were not very dull and stupid, the signatures and proofs of Deity which are to be found on the theater of the world, are abundant enough to incite us to acknowledge 			 and reverence God; but as, although surrounded with so clear a light, we are nevertheless blind, this splendid representation of the glory of God, without the aid of the word, would profit us nothing, although it should be to us as a loud and distinct proclamation sounding in our ears. Accordingly, God vouchsafes to those whom he has determined to call to salvation special grace, just as in ancient times, while he gave to all men without exception evidences of his existence in his works, he 			 communicated to the children of Abraham alone his Law, thereby to furnish them with a more certain and intimate knowledge of his majesty. Whence it follows, that the Jews are bound by a double tie to serve God. As the Gentiles, to whom God has spoken only by the dumb creatures, have no excuse for their ignorance, how much less is their stupidity to be endured who neglect to hear the voice which proceeds from his own sacred mouth? The end, therefore, which David here has in view, is to excite 			 the Jews, whom God had bound to himself by a more sacred bond, to yield obedience to him with a more prompt and cheerful affection. Farther, under the term <i>law, </i>he not only means the rule of living righteously, or the Ten Commandments, but he also comprehends the covenant by which God had distinguished that people from the rest of the world, and the whole doctrine of Moses, the parts of which he afterwards enumerates under the terms <i>testimonies, statutes, </i>and other names. These titles and commendations by which he exalts the dignity and excellence of the Law would not agree with the Ten Commandments alone, unless there were, at the same time, joined to them a free adoption and the promises which depend upon it; and, in short, the whole body of doctrine of which true religion and godliness consists. As to the Hebrew words which are here used, I will not spend much time in endeavoring 			 very exactly to give the particular signification of each of them, because it is easy to gather from other passages, that they are sometimes confounded or used indifferently. <a name="xxv.ii-p8.1"></a>עדות, <i>eduth, </i>which we render <i>testimony, </i>is generally taken for the covenant, in which God, on the one hand, promised 			 to the children of Abraham that he would be their God, and on the other required faith and obedience on their part. It, therefore, denotes the mutual covenant entered into between God and his ancient people. The word <a name="xxv.ii-p8.2"></a>פקודים, <i>pikkudim, </i>which I have followed others in translating <i>statutes, </i>is 			 restricted by some to ceremonies, but improperly in my judgment: for I find that it is every where taken generally for ordinances and edicts. The word <a name="xxv.ii-p8.3"></a>מצוה, <i>mitsvah, </i>which follows immediately after, and which we translate <i>commandment, </i>has almost the same signification. As to the other words, 			 we shall consider them in their respective places.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p9"></a>The first commendation of the law of God is, that it is <i>perfect. </i>By this word David means, that if a man is duly instructed in the law of God, he wants nothing which is requisite to perfect wisdom. In the writings of heathen authors there are no doubt to be found true and useful sentences scattered here and there; and it is also true, that God has put into the minds of men some knowledge of justice and uprightness; but in consequence of 			 the corruption of our nature, the true light of truth is not to be found among men where revelation is not enjoyed, but only certain mutilated principles which are involved in much obscurity and doubt. David, therefore, justly claims this praise for the law of God, that it contains in it perfect and absolute wisdom. As <i>the conversion of the soul, </i>of which he speaks immediately after, is doubtless to be understood of its <i>restoration, </i>I have felt no difficulty in so rendering it. 			 There are some who reason with too much subtilty on this expression, by explaining it as referring to the repentance and regeneration of man. I admit that the soul cannot be restored by the law of God, without being at the same time renewed unto righteousness; but we must consider what is David’s proper meaning, which is this, that as the soul gives vigor and strength to the body, so the law in like manner is the life of the soul. In saying that the soul is restored, he has an allusion to the 			 miserable state in which we are all born. There, no doubt, still survive in us some small remains of the first creation; but as no part of our constitution is free from defilement and impurity, the condition of the soul thus corrupted and depraved differs little from death, and tends altogether to death. It is, therefore, necessary that God should employ the law as a remedy for restoring us to purity; not that the letter of the law can do this of itself, as shall be afterwards shown more at 			 length, but because God employs his word as an instrument for restoring our souls.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p10"></a>When the Psalmist declares, <i>The testimony of Jehovah is faithful,</i> it is a repetition of the preceding sentence, so that <i>the integrity </i>or <i>perfection of the law </i>and <i>the faithfulness 			 </i>or <i>truth of his testimony, </i>signify the same thing; namely, that when we give ourselves up to be guided and governed by the word of God, we are in no danger of going astray, since this is the path by which he securely guides his own people to salvation. <i>Instruction in wisdom</i> seems here to be added as the commencement of the restoration of the soul. Understanding is the most excellent endowment of the soul; and David teaches us that it is to be derived from the law, for we are naturally destitute of it. By the word <i>babes, </i>he is not to be understood as meaning any particular class of persons, as if others were sufficiently 			 wise of themselves; but by it he teaches us, in the first place, that none are endued with right understanding until they have made progress in the study of the law. In the second place, he shows by it what kind of scholars God requires, namely, those who are fools in their own estimation, (<a name="xxv.ii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018">1Co 3:18</a><a name="xxv.ii-p10.1"></a>,) and who come down to the rank of children, that the loftiness of their 			 own understanding may not prevent them from giving themselves up, with a spirit of entire docility, to the teaching of the word of God.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p12"></a><b>8.</b> <i>The statutes of Jehovah are right.</i> The Psalmist at first view may seem to utter a mere common-place sentiment when he calls the statutes of the Lord <i>right. </i>If we, however, more attentively consider the contrast which he no doubt makes 			 between the rectitude of the law and the crooked ways in which men entangle themselves when they follow their own understandings, we will be convinced that this commendation implies more than may at first sight appear. We know how much every man is wedded to himself, and how difficult it is to eradicate from our minds the vain confidence of our own wisdom. It is therefore of great importance to be well convinced of this truth, that a man’s life cannot be ordered aright unless it is framed 			 according to the law of God, and that without this he can only wander in labyrinths and crooked bypaths. David adds, in the second place, <i>that God’s statutes rejoice the heart. </i>This implies that there is no other joy true and solid but that which proceeds from a good conscience; and of this we become partakers when we are certainly persuaded that our life is pleasing and acceptable to God. No doubt, the source from which true peace of conscience 			 proceeds is faith, which freely reconciles us to God. But to the saints who serve God with true affection of heart there arises unspeakable joy also, from the knowledge that they do not labor in his service in vain, or without hope of recompense, since they have God as the judge and approver of their life. In short, this joy is put in opposition to all the corrupt enticements and pleasures of the world, which are a deadly bait, luring wretched souls to their everlasting destruction. The import 			 of the Psalmist’s language is, Those who take delight in committing sin procure for themselves abundant matter of sorrow; but the observance of the law of God, on the contrary, brings to man true joy. In the end of the verse, the Psalmist teaches that <i>the commandment of God is pure, enlightening the eyes</i> By this he gives us tacitly to understand that it is only in the 			 commandments of God that we find the difference between good and evil laid down, and that it is in vain to seek it elsewhere, since whatever men devise of themselves is mere filth and refuse, corrupting the purity of the life. He farther intimates that men, with all their acuteness, are blind, and always wander in darkness, until they turn their eyes to the light of heavenly doctrine. Whence it follows, that none are truly wise but those who take God for their conductor and guide, following the 			 path which he points out to them, and who are diligently seeking after the peace which he offers and presents by his word.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p13"></a>But here a question of no small difficulty arises; for Paul seems entirely to overthrow these commendations of the law which David here recites. How can these things agree together: that the law restores the souls of men, while yet it is a dead and deadly letter? that it rejoices men’s hearts, and yet, by bringing in the spirit of bondage, strikes them with terror? that it enlightens the eyes, and yet, by casting a veil before our minds, 			 excludes the light which ought to penetrate within? But, in the first place, we must remember what I have shown you at the commencement, that David does not speak simply of the precepts of the Moral Law, but comprehends the whole covenant by which God had adopted the descendants of Abraham to be his peculiar people; and, therefore, to the Moral Law, the rule of living well — he joins the free promises of salvation, or rather Christ himself, in whom and upon whom this adoption was founded. But 			 Paul, who had to deal with persons who perverted and abused the law, and separated it from the grace and the Spirit of Christ, refers to the ministry of Moses viewed merely by itself, and according to the letter. It is certain, that if the Spirit of Christ does not quicken the law, the law is not only unprofitable, but also deadly to its disciples. Without Christ there is in the law nothing but inexorable rigour, which adjudges all mankind to the wrath and curse of God. And farther, without 			 Christ, there remains within us a rebelliousness of the flesh, which kindles in our hearts a hatred of God and of his law, and from this proceed the distressing bondage and awful terror of which the Apostle speaks. These different ways in which the law may be viewed, easily show us the manner of reconciling these passages of Paul and David, which seem at first view to be at variance. The design of Paul is to show what the law can do for us, taken by itself; that is to say, what it can do for us 			 when, without the promise of grace, it strictly and rigorously exacts from us the duty which we owe to God; but David, in praising it as he here does, speaks of the whole doctrine of the law, which includes also the gospel, and, therefore, under the law he comprehends Christ.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.ii-p14"></a><a name="xxv.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p15"></a><b>9.</b> <i>The fear of Jehovah is clean.</i> By the <i>fear of God </i>we are here to understand the way in which God is to be served; and therefore it is taken in an active sense for the doctrine which prescribes to us the manner in which we ought to fear 			 God. The way in which men generally manifest their fear of God, is by inventing false religions and a vitiated worship; in doing which they only so much the more provoke his wrath. David, therefore, here indirectly condemns these corrupt inventions, about which men torment themselves in vain,   			  <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">456</font></a>
  			  and which often sanction impurity; and in opposition to them he justly affirms, that in the keeping of the law there is an exemption from every thing which defiles. He adds, that <i>it endures for ever; </i>as if he had said, This is the treasure of everlasting happiness. We see how mankind, without well thinking what they are doing, pursue, with impetuous and ardent affections, the transitory things of this world; but, in 			 thus catching at the empty shadow of a happy life, they lose true happiness itself. In the second clause, by calling the commandments of God <i>truth, </i>David shows that whatever men undertake to do at the mere suggestion of their own minds, without having a regard to the law of God as a rule, is error and falsehood. And, indeed, he could not have more effectually stirred us up to love, and zealously to live according to the law, than by giving us 			 this warning, that all those who order their life, without having any respect to the law of God, deceive themselves, and follow after mere delusions. Those who explain the word <i>judgments, </i>as referring only to the commandments of the second table, are, in my opinion, mistaken: for David’s purpose was to commend, under a variety of expressions, the advantages which the faithful receive from the law of God. When he says, <i>They are justified together, </i>the meaning is, They are all righteous from the greatest to the least, without a single exception. By this commendation he distinguishes the law of God from all the doctrines of men, for no blemish or fault can be found in it, but it is in all points absolutely perfect.</p>  <a name="xxv.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.iii-p6"></a><b>10. </b><i>More to be desired are they than gold.</i> The Psalmist now exalts the law of God both on account of its price and sweetness. This commendation depends on the commendations given in the preceding verses; for the many and great advantages which he has just now enumerated, ought justly to make us account heavenly 			 truth the highest and most excellent treasure, and to despise, when compared with it, all the gold and silver of the world. Instead of the word <i>fine gold, </i>which the Latins have called <i>Aurum obryzum,</i>   			  <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">458</font></a>
  			  some render the Hebrew word <i>a jewel, </i>or <i>precious stones,</i>   			  <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">459</font></a>
  			  but the other translation is more generally received, namely, <i>fine gold, </i>that is, gold which is pure and well refined in the furnace; and there are many passages of Scripture by which this rendering is confirmed.   			  <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">460</font></a>
  			  The Hebrew word <a name="xxv.iii-p9.3"></a>פז, <i>paz, </i>is derived from <a name="xxv.iii-p9.4"></a>פזה, <i>pazah, </i>which signifies <i>to strengthen;</i>   			  <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">461</font></a>
  			  from which we may conjecture that the Psalmist does not mean the gold of any particular country, as if one should say the gold of Ophir, but gold completely refined and purified by art. So far is <a name="xxv.iii-p10.2"></a>פז, <i>paz, </i>from being derived from the name of a country, that, on the contrary, it appears 			 from <a name="xxv.iii-p10.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009">Jer 10:9</a><a name="xxv.iii-p10.3"></a>, that the land of Uphaz took its name from this Hebrew word, because it had in it mines of the finest gold. As to the origin of the word <i>obrizum, </i>which the Latins have used, we cannot say any thing with certainty, except that, according to the conjecture of Jerome, it signifies <i>brought from 			 the land of Ophir, </i>as if it had been said, <i>aurum Ophrizum. </i>In short, the sense is, that we do not esteem the law as it deserves, if we do not prefer it to all the riches of the world. If we are once brought thus highly to prize the law, it will serve effectually to deliver our hearts from an immoderate desire of gold and silver. To this esteem of the law there must be added love to it, and delight in it, so that it may 			 not only subdue us to obedience by constraint, but also allure us by its sweetness; a thing which is impossible, unless, at the same time, we have mortified in us the love of carnal pleasures, with which it is not wonderful to see us enticed and ensnared, so long as we reject, through a vitiated taste, the righteousness of God. From this we may again deduce another evidence, that David’s discourse is not to be understood simply of the commandments, and of the dead letter, but that he 			 comprehends, at the same time, the promises by which the grace of God is offered to us. If the law did nothing else but command us, how could it be loved, since in commanding it terrifies us, because we all fail in keeping it?   			  <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">462</font></a>
  			  Certainly, if we separate the law from the hope of pardon, and from the Spirit of Christ, so far from tasting it to be sweet as honey, we will rather find in it a bitterness which kills our wretched souls.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.iii-p13"></a><b>11. </b><i>Moreover, by them is thy servant made circumspect.</i> These words may be extended generally to all the people of God; but they are properly to be understood of David himself, and by them he testifies that he knew well, from his own experience, all that he had stated in the preceding verses respecting the 			 law. No man will ever speak truly and in good earnest of heavenly truth, but he who has it deeply fixed in his own heart. David therefore acknowledges, that whatever prudence he had for regulating and framing his life aright, he was indebted for it to the law of God. Although, however, it is properly of himself that he speaks, yet by his own example he sets forth a general rule, namely, that if persons wish to have a proper method for governing the life well, the law of God alone is perfectly 			 sufficient for this purpose; but that, on the contrary, as soon as persons depart from it, they are liable to fall into numerous errors and sins. It is to be observed that David, by all at once turning his discourse to God, appeals to him as a witness of what he had said, the more effectually to convince men that he speaks sincerely and from the bottom of his heart. As the Hebrew word <a name="xxv.iii-p13.1"></a>זהר, <i>zahar, </i>which I have translated <i>made circumspect, </i>signifies <i>to teach, </i>as well as <i>to be on one’s guard, </i>some translate it in this place, <i>Thy servant is taught, </i>or <i>warned, </i>by the 			 commandments of the law. But the sentence implies much more, when it is viewed as meaning that he who yields himself to God to be governed by him is made circumspect and cautious, and, therefore, this translation seems to me to be preferable. In the second clause the Psalmist declares, that whoever yield themselves to God to observe the rule of righteousness which he prescribes, do not lose their labor, seeing he has in reserve for them a great and rich reward: <i>In keeping of them there is great reward. </i>It is no mean commendation of the law when it is said, that in it God enters into covenant with us, and, so to speak, brings himself under obligation to recompense our obedience. In requiring from us whatever is contained in the law, he demands nothing but what he has a right to; yet such is his free and undeserved liberality, that he promises to his servants a reward, which, in 			 point of justice, he does not owe them. The promises of the law, it is true, are made of no effect; but it is through our fault: for even he who is most perfect amongst us comes far short of full and complete righteousness; and men cannot expect any reward for their works until they have perfectly and to the full satisfied the requirements of the law. Thus these two doctrines completely harmonize: first, that eternal life shall be given as the reward of works to him who fulfils the law in all 			 points; and, secondly, that the law notwithstanding denounces a curse against all men, because the whole human family are destitute of the righteousness of works. This will presently appear from the following verse. David, after having celebrated this benefit of the law - that it offers an abundant reward to those who serve God — immediately changes his discourse, and cries out, <i>Who</i> <i>can understand his errors?</i> by which he pronounces all men liable to eternal death, and thus utterly overthrows all the confidence which men may be disposed to place in the merit of their works. It may be objected, that this commendation, <i>In the keeping of thy commandments there is great reward, </i>is in vain ascribed to the law, seeing it is without effect. The answer is easy, namely, that as in the covenant of adoption there is included the free pardon of sins, upon which depends the imputation of righteousness, God bestows a recompense upon the works of his people, although, in point of justice, it is not due to them. What God promises in the law to those who perfectly obey it, true believers obtain by his gracious liberality and fatherly goodness, inasmuch as he accepts 			 for perfect righteousness their holy desires and earnest endeavors to obey.</p>  <a name="xxv.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p8"></a><b>12. </b><i>Who can understand his errors?</i> This exclamation shows us what use we should make of the promises of the law, which have a condition annexed to them. It is this: As soon as they come forth, every man should examine his own life, and compare not only his actions, but also his 			 thoughts, with that perfect rule of righteousness which is laid down in the law. Thus it will come to pass, that all, from the least to the greatest, seeing themselves cut off from all hope of reward from the law, will be constrained to flee for refuge to the mercy of God. It is not enough to consider what the doctrine of the law contains; we must also look into ourselves, that we may see how far short we have come in our obedience to the law. Whenever the Papists hear this promise,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xxv.iv-p9"></a>“He who doeth these things shall live in them,” <br> 			 (<a name="xxv.iv-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="xxv.iv-p9.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p10"></a>they do not hesitate at once to connect eternal life with the merit of their works, as if it were in their own power to fulfill the law, of which we are all transgressors, not only in one point, but in all its parts. David, therefore, being involved as it were in a labyrinth on all sides, acknowledges with astonishment that he is overwhelmed under a sense of the multitude of his sins. We ought then to remember, in the first 			 place, that as we are personally destitute of the righteousness which the law requires, we are on that account excluded from the hope of the reward which the law has promised; and, in the next place, that we are guilty before God, not of one fault or of two, but of sins innumerable, so that we ought, with the bitterest sorrow, to bewail our depravity, which not only deprives us of the blessing of God, but also turns to us life into death. This David did. There is no doubt that when, after 			 having said that God liberally offers a reward to all who observe his law, he cried out, <i>Who can understand his errors? it</i> was from the terror with which he was stricken in thinking upon his sins. By the Hebrew word <a name="xxv.iv-p10.1"></a>שגיאות, <i>shegioth, </i>which we have 			 translated <i>errors, </i>some think David intends lesser faults; but in my judgment he meant simply to say, that Satan has so many devices by which he deludes and blinds our minds, that there is not a man who knows the hundredth part of his own sins. The saints, it is true, often offend in lesser matters, through ignorance and inadvertence; but it happens also that, being entangled in the snares of Satan, they do not perceive even the grosser faults 			 which they have committed. Accordingly, all the sins to the commission of which men give themselves loose reins, not being duly sensible of the evil which is in them, and being deceived by the allurements of the flesh, are justly included under the Hebrew word here used by David, which signifies <i>faults </i>or <i>ignorances.</i>   			  <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">466</font></a>
  			  In summoning himself and others before the judgment-seat of God, he warns himself and them, that although their consciences do not condemn them, they are not on that account absolved; for God sees far more clearly than men’s consciences, since even those who look most attentively into themselves, do not perceive a great part of the sins with which they are chargeable.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p12"></a>After making this confession, David adds a prayer for pardon, <i>Cleanse thou me from my secret sins.</i> The word <i>cleanse </i>is to be referred not to the blessing of regeneration, but to free forgiveness; for the Hebrew verb <a name="xxv.iv-p12.1"></a>נקה, <i>nakah, </i>here used, comes from a word which signifies <i>to</i> <i>be innocent. </i>The Psalmist explains more clearly what he intended by the word <i>errors, </i>in now calling them <i>secret sins; </i>that is to say, those with respect to which men deceive themselves, by thinking that they are no sins, and who thus deceive themselves not only purposely and by expressly aiming at doing so, but because they do not enter into the due consideration of the majesty of the judgment of God. It is in vain to attempt to justify ourselves under the pretext and excuse of ignorance. Nor does it avail any thing to be blind as to our faults, since no man is a competent judge in his own cause. 			 We must, therefore, never account ourselves to be pure and innocent until we are pronounced such by God’s sentence of absolution or acquittal. The faults which we do not perceive must necessarily come under the review of God’s judgment, and entail upon us condemnation, unless he blot them out and pardon them; and if so, how shall he escape and remain unpunished who, besides these, is chargeable with sins of which he knows himself to be guilty, and on account of which his own conscience compels 			 him to judge and condemn himself? Farther, we should remember that we are not guilty of one offense only, but are overwhelmed with an immense mass of impurities. The more diligently any one examines himself, the more readily will he acknowledge with David, that if God should discover our secret faults, there would be found in us an abyss of sins so great as to have neither bottom nor shore, as we say;   			  <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">467</font></a>
  			  for no man can comprehend in how many ways he is guilty before God. From this also it appears, that the Papists are bewitched, and chargeable with the grossest hypocrisy, when they pretend that they can easily and speedily gather all their sins once a year into a bundle. The decree of the Lateran Council commands every one to confess all his sins once every year, and at the same time declares that there is no hope of pardon but in complying with that decree. 			 Accordingly, the blinded Papist, by going to the confessional, to mutter his sins into the ear of the priest, thinks he has done all that is required, as if he could count upon his fingers all the sins which he has committed during the course of the whole year; whereas, even the saints, by strictly examining themselves, can scarcely come to the knowledge of the hundredth part of their sins, and, therefore, with one voice unite with David in saying, <i>Who can understand his errors?</i> Nor will it do to allege that it is enough if each performs the duty of reckoning up his sins to the utmost of his ability. This does not diminish, in any degree, the absurdity of this famous decree.   			  <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">468</font></a>
  			  As it is impossible for us to do what the law requires, all whose hearts are really and deeply imbued with the principle of the fear of God must necessarily be overwhelmed with despair, so long as they think themselves bound to enumerate all their sins, in order to their being pardoned; and those who imagine they can disburden themselves of their sins in this way must be persons altogether stupid. I know that some explain these words in a different sense, viewing 			 them as a prayer, in which David beseeches God, by the guidance of his Holy Spirit, to recover him from all his errors. But, in my opinion, they are to be viewed rather as a prayer for forgiveness, and what follows in the next verse is a prayer for the aid of the Holy Spirit, and for success to overcome temptations.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.iv-p15"></a><a name="xxv.iv-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p16"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins.</i> By <i>presumptuous sins </i>he means known and evident transgressions,   			  <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">469</font></a>
  			  accompanied with proud contempt and obstinacy. By the word <i>keep back, </i>he intimates, that such is the natural propensity of the flesh to sin, that even the saints themselves would immediately break forth or rush headlong into it, did not God, by his own guardianship and protection, keep them back. It is to be observed, that while he calls himself <i>the servant of God, </i>he 			 nevertheless acknowledges that he had need of the bridle, lest he should arrogantly and rebelliously break forth in transgressing the law of God. Being regenerated by the Spirit of God, he groaned, it is true, under the burden of his sins; but he knew, on the other hand, how great is the rebellion of the flesh, and how much we are inclined to forgetfulness of God, from which proceed contempt of his majesty and all impiety. Now, if David, who had made so much progress in the fear of God, was not 			 beyond the danger of transgressing, how shall the carnal and unrenewed man, in whom innumerable lusts exercise dominion, be able to restrain and govern himself by his own free will? Let us learn, then, even although the unruliness of our wayward flesh has been already subdued by the denial of ourselves, to walk in fear and trembling; for unless God restrain us, our hearts will violently boil with a proud and insolent contempt of God. This sense is confirmed by the reason added immediately 			 after, <i>that they may not have dominion over me.</i> By these words he expressly declares, that unless God assist him, he will not only be unable to resist, but will be wholly brought under the dominion of the worst vices. This passage, therefore, teaches us not only that all mankind are naturally enslaved to sin, but that the faithful themselves would become the bond-slaves of sin 			 also, if God did not unceasingly watch over them to guide them in the path of holiness, and to strengthen them for persevering in it. There is also another useful lesson which we have here to attend to, namely, that we ought never to pray for pardon, without, at the same time, asking to be strengthened and fortified by the power of God for the time to come, that temptations, in future, may not gain advantage over us. And although we may feel in our hearts the incitements of concupiscence 			 goading and distressing us, we ought not, on that account, to become discouraged. The remedy to which we should have recourse is to pray to God to restrain us. No doubt, David could have wished to feel in his heart no stirrings of corruption; but knowing that he would never be wholly free from the remains of sin, until at death he had put off this corrupt nature, he prays to be armed with the grace of the Holy Spirit for the combat, that iniquity might not reign victorious over him. In the end 			 of the verse there are two things to be observed. David, in affirming that <i>he shall then be upright and clean from much wickedness,</i> attributes, in the first place, the honor of preserving him innocent to the spiritual assistance of God; and depending upon it, he confidently assures himself of victory over all the armies of Satan. In the second place, he acknowledges, that unless 			 he is assisted by God, he will be overwhelmed with an immense load, and plunged as it were into a boundless abyss of wickedness: for he says, that aided by God, he will be clear not of one fault or of two, but of many. From this it follows, that as soon as we are abandoned by the grace of God, there is no kind of sin in which Satan may not entangle us. Let this confession of David then quicken us to earnestness in prayer; for in the midst of so many and various snares, it does not become us to 			 fall asleep or to be indolent. Again, let the other part of the Psalmist’s exercise predominate in our hearts — let us boast with him, that although Satan may assault us by many and strong armies, we will nevertheless be invincible, provided we have the aid of God, and will continue, in despite of every hostile attempt, to hold fast our integrity.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p19"></a><b>14. </b><i>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart.</i> David asks still more expressly to be fortified by the grace of God, and thus enabled to live an upright and holy life. The substance of the verse is this: I beseech thee, O God, not only to keep me from breaking forth into the external acts of 			 transgression, but also to frame my tongue and my heart to the obedience of thy law. We know how difficult it is, even for the most perfect, so to bridle their words and thoughts, as that nothing may pass through their heart or mouth which is contrary to the will of God; and yet this inward purity is what the law chiefly requires of us. Now, the rarer this virtue — the rarer this strict control of the heart and of the tongue is, let us learn so much the more the necessity of our being governed 			 by the Holy Spirit, in order to regulate our life uprightly and honestly. By the word <i>acceptable, </i>the Psalmist shows that the only rule of living well is for men to endeavor to please God, and to be approved of him. The concluding words, in which he calls God <i>his strength and his redeemer, </i>he employs to confirm himself in the 			 assured confidence of obtaining his requests.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p3"></a> “<a name="xxv.i-p3.1"></a>L’entour du ciel et de l’air.” —<i> Note, Fr. marg. </i>“That is, the cope or vault of the heaven and of the air.” <i>Bishop</i> <i>Mant</i> reads also <i>expanse, </i>which he considers more correct than <i>firmament. </i>“The latter word,” says he, “is adopted from the Greek version; but the Hebrew word is derived from a verb, signifying <i>to spread abroad, stretch forth, extend, 						expand. </i>The proper rendering therefore is, ‘expanse,’ agreeably to other passages of Scripture which speak of the Creator as <i>stretching out </i>the heavens as a curtain, and spreading them out as a tent to dwell in.” (See <a name="xxv.i-p3.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002">Ps 104:2</a><a name="xxv.i-p3.2"></a>; <a name="xxv.i-p3.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022">Isa 40:22</a><a name="xxv.i-p3.3"></a>.) “The expanse of heaven is a frequent phrase with <i>Milton</i>, as with 						other poets.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p8"></a> <i>Dr Geddes</i> has remarked, in reference to this psalm, that “no poem ever contained a finer argument against Atheism, nor one better expressed.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p14"></a> Both Calvin and the translators of our English version appear to have followed the Septuagint and Vulgate versions in inserting the word <i>where, </i>which is not in the Hebrew text.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p15"></a> “<a name="xxv.i-p15.1"></a>C’est as avoir ces mots, Lequel, Laquelle, etc., comme yci Il n’y a langage, il n’y a paroles esquelles la voix de ceux ne soit ouye.” — <i>Fr</i>.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p16"></a> <a name="xxv.i-p16.1"></a>בלי, <i>beli, </i>commonly signifies <i>not; </i>but it is also often used for all sort of exclusive particles, <i>without, besides, unless. </i>Hence <i>Grotius</i> renders it here <i>without. </i>As, <a name="xxv.i-p16.2"></a>בל <i>bal, </i>means in Arabic <i>but, </i>and as the Arabic is just a dialect of the Hebrew, Hammond concludes that this may have been its meaning among the Jews; and therefore proposes to render the verse thus:— 				  “Not speech, nor words, but, or notwithstanding, [<a name="xxv.i-p16.3"></a>בלי, <i>beli,</i>] their voice is, or has been heard.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p19"></a> The reading in the English Geneva Bible is, “Their line is gone forth through all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.” The marginal note in explanation of this is, “The heavens are as a line of great capital letters to show unto us God’s glory.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.i-p22"></a> Paul reads, “their sound,” quoting from the Septuagint, the version of the Old Testament then chiefly used, and it employs here the word <a name="xxv.i-p22.1"></a>φθόγγος.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.ii-p3"></a> Here our author uses <a name="xxv.ii-p3.1"></a>Dominus, but in the Hebrew text it is <a name="xxv.ii-p3.2"></a>יהוה, <i>Yehovah.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.iv-p4"></a> The word which our author uses denotes literally <i>arrogances </i>or <i>proudnesses; </i>and this is also the literal rendering of the Hebrew word here used.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.iv-p5"></a> <i>From much wickedness.</i> This translation conveys the precise meaning of what David intended. He was afraid of incurring accumulated guilt. In our English translation it is “the great transgression,” on which <i>Walford</i> remarks, “The insertion of the definite article ‘the’ is not authorised by the original, and leads to a supposition which is incorrect, that some definite crime, such as ‘the sin against the Holy Ghost,’ is 						intended.”</p>
