 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="v.i"></a> 		  <h2 align="center"><a name="v.i-p0.1"></a>BOOK 1 </h2>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p1"></a>1. The true wisdom of man consists in the knowledge of God the Creator and Redeemer.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p2"></a>2. This knowledge is naturally implanted in us, and the end of it ought to be the worship of God rightly performed, or reverence for the Deity accompanied by fear and love.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p3"></a>3. But this seed is corrupted by ignorance, whence arises superstitious worship; and by wickedness, whence arise slavish dread and hatred of the Deity.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p4"></a>4. It is also from another source that it is derived namely, from the structure of the whole world, and from the Holy Scriptures.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p5"></a>5. This structure teaches us what is the goodness, power, justice, and wisdom of God in creating all things in heaven and earth, and in preserving them by ordinary and extraordinary government, by which his Providence is more clearly made known. It teaches also what are our wants, that we may learn to place our confidence in the goodness, power, and wisdom of God, to obey his commandments, to flee to him in adversity, and to offer thanksgiving to him for the gifts which 			 we enjoy.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p6"></a>6. By the Holy Scriptures, also, God the Creator is known. We ought to consider what these Scriptures are; that they are true, and have proceeded from the Spirit of God; which is proved by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, by the efficacy and antiquity of the Scriptures, by the certainty of the Prophecies, by the miraculous preservation of the Law, by the calling and writings of the Apostles, by the consent of the Church, and by the steadfastness of the martyrs, whence 			 it is evident that all the principles of piety are overthrown by those fanatics who, laying aside the Scripture, fly to revelations.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p7"></a>7. Next, what they teach; or, what is the nature of God in himself, and in the creation and government of all things.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p8"></a>8. The nature of God in himself is infinite, invisible, eternal, almighty; whence it follows that they are mistaken who ascribe to God a visible form. In his one essence there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p9"></a>9. In the creation of all things there are chiefly considered, 1. Heavenly and spiritual substances, that is, angels, of which some are good and the protectors of the godly, while others are bad, not by creation, but by corruption; 2. Earthly substances, and particularly man, whose perfection is displayed in soul and in body.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p10"></a>10. In the government of all things the nature of God is manifested. Now his government is, in one respect, universal, by which he directs all the creatures according to the properties which he bestowed on each when he created them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p11"></a>11. In another respect, it is special; which appears in regard to contingent events, so that if any person is visited either by adversity or by any prosperous result, he ought to ascribe it wholly to God; and with respect to those things which act according to a fixed law of nature, though their peculiar properties were naturally bestowed on them, still they exert their power only so far as they are directed by the immediate hand of God.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p12"></a>12. It is viewed also with respect to time past and future. <i>Past</i>, that we may learn that all things happen by the appointment of God, who acts either by means, or without means, or contrary to means; so that everything which happens yields good to the godly and evil to the wicked. <i>Future</i>, to which belong human deliberations, and which shows that we ought to employ lawful means; since that Providence on which we rely furnishes its own means.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.i-p13"></a>13. Lastly, by attending to the advantage which the godly derive from it. For we know certainly, 1. That God takes care of the whole human race, but especially of his Church. 2. That God governs all things by his will, and regulates them by his wisdom. 3. That he has most abundant power of doing good; for in his hand are heaven and earth, all creatures are subject to his sway, the godly rest on his protection, and the power of hell is restrained by his authority. That 			 nothing happens by chance, though the causes may be concealed, but by the will of God; by his secret will which we are unable to explore, but adore with reverence, and by his will which is conveyed to us in the Law and in the Gospel.</p>
