 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p5"></a><b>3</b> but hath manifested in his own times his word (or, <i>by his word,) </i>in the preaching which hath been committed to me, according to the appointment of God our Savior;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p6"></a><b>4</b> To Titus, my own son, according to the common faith, grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p7"></a><b>5</b> For this reason I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest continue to correct those things which are still wanting, f   				 <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">283</font></a>
  				 and mightst ordain presbyters f   				 <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">284</font></a>
  				 in each city, as I appointed thee:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p10"></a><b>6</b> If any one is blameless, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of licentiousness, not disobedient.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p11"></a><b>7</b> For a bishop ought to be blameless, as a governor of the house of God; not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, not a striker, not wickedly desirous of gain;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p12"></a><b>8</b> But hospitable, devoted to kindness, prudent, just, holy, temperate;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p13"></a><b>9</b> Holding fast the faithful word, which is according to instruction, that he maybe able both to exhort by sound doctrine, and to convince adversaries.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p14"></a><b>10</b> For there are many unruly,  				 <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">285</font></a>
  				 and vain talkers, and deceivers of minds’ chiefly they who are of the circumcision;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p16"></a><b>11</b> Whose month must be stopped, who overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p17"></a><b>12</b> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p18"></a><b>13</b> This testimony is true; wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p19"></a><b>14</b> And may not give heed to Jewish fables, and to commandments of men who turn aside from the truth.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p20"></a><b>15</b> To the pure all things indeed are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure, but their mind and conscience are polluted.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.i-p21"></a><b>16</b> They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him; for they are abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</p>  <a name="vii.iii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p5"></a><b>3</b> That aged women, in like manner, wear raiment which becomes religious persons, that they be not slanderers, not slaves to much wine, (that they be) teachers of what is good;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p6"></a><b>4</b> That they may teach the young women temperance to love their husbands and their children,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p7"></a><b>5</b> To be temperate, chaste, keepers of the house, kind, subject to their husbands f   				 <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">286</font></a>
  				 that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</p>

 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p10"></a><b>7</b> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine, (chewing) integrity, gravity;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p11"></a><b>8</b> Sound speech, unblameable, that the adversary may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p12"></a><b>9</b> Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, endeavoring to please them in all things, not answering again;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p13"></a><b>10</b> Not thievish, but shewing all good faith, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p14"></a><b>11</b> For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p15"></a><b>12</b> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live temperately and righteously and piously, in this world,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p16"></a><b>13</b> Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of Jesus Christ, the great God and our Savior,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p17"></a><b>14</b> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar, people, zealous of good works. f   				 <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">287</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p19"></a><b>15</b> Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>  <a name="vii.iii.iii"></a>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p1"></a>  			 
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="vii.iii.iii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 3</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p3"></a><b>1</b> Remind them to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p4"></a><b>2</b> To speak evil of no one, not to be given to fighting, (to be) kind, shew shewing all meekness towards all men.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p5"></a><b>3</b> For we ourselves were also formerly foolish, disobedient, going astray, serving various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,  				 <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">288</font></a>
  				 and hating one another.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p7"></a><b>4</b> But after that the goodness and love of God our Savior towards men appeared,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p8"></a><b>5</b> Not by works, which were in righteousness, which we had done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and of the renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p9"></a><b>6</b> Which (or, <i>whom) </i>he shed abundantly on us, through Jesus Christ our Savior,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p10"></a><b>7</b> That, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p11"></a><b>8</b> A faithful saying: I wish thee to affirm these things, that they who have believed in God may be careful to excel in good works, <i>(or, to extol good works, or, to assign to them the highest rank.) </i>For these things are honorable and profitable to men</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p12"></a><b>9</b> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and unnecessary.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p13"></a><b>10</b> Avoid an heretical man after the first and second admonition;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p14"></a><b>11</b> Knowing that he who is such is ruined, being condemned by himself.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p15"></a><b>12</b> When I shall send to thee Artemas, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me to Nicopolis for I have determined to winter there.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p16"></a><b>13</b> Be careful to help forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollo, that they may not be in want of anything.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p17"></a><b>14</b> And let ours also learn to excel in good works (or, as formerly, to <i>assign to them the highest rank, that they may excel,) </i>for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p18"></a><b>15</b> All who are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in faith. Grace (be) with you all. Amen.</p>
