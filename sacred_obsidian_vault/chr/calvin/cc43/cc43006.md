 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.iv.i-p1"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001">1 Timothy 2:1-4</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></a></p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p2"></a><b>1</b>. I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p3"></a><b>1</b>. Adbortor igitur, ut ante omnia fiant deprecationes, obsecrationes, interpellationes, gratiarum actiones pro omnibus hominibus,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p4"></a><b>2.</b> For kings, and <i>for</i> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p5"></a><b>2</b>. Pro regibus et omnibus in eminentia constitutis, ut placidam et quietam vitam degamus cum omni pietate et honestate.</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p6"></a><b>3</b>. For this <i>is</i> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p7"></a><b>3</b>. Hoc enim bonum et acceptum coram Salvatore nostro Deo,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p8"></a><b>4</b>. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p9"></a><b>4</b>. Qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis venire.</p> 				    				  			   			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p10"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p10.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p11"></a><b>1</b> <i>I exhort therefore</i>. These exercises of godliness maintain and even strengthen us in the sincere worship and fear of God, and cherish the good conscience of which he had spoken. Not inappropriately does he make use of the word <i>therefore</i>, to denote an inference; for those exhortations depend on 				the preceding commandment.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p12"></a><i>That, above all, prayers be made</i>. First, he speaks of public prayers, which he enjoins to be offered, not only for believers, but for all mankind. Some might reason thus with themselves: “Why should we be anxious about the salvation of unbelievers, with whom we have no connection? Is it not enough, if we, who are brethren, pray mutually for our brethren, and recommend to God the whole of his 				Church? for we have nothing to do with strangers.” This perverse view Paul meets, and enjoins the Ephesians to include in their prayers all men, and not to limit them to the body of the Church.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p13"></a>What is the difference between three out of the four kinds which Paul enumerates, I own that I do not thoroughly understand. The view given by Augustine, who twists Paul’s words so as to denote ceremonial observances customary at that time, is quite childish. A simpler exposition is given by those who think that “requests” are when we ask to be delivered from what is evil; “prayers,” when we desire to obtain something profitable; and 				“supplications,” when we deplore before God injuries which we have endured. Yet for my own part, I do not draw the difference so ingeniously; or, at least, I prefer another way of distinguishing them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p14"></a>Προσευχαὶ is the Greek word for every kind of prayer; and δεήσεις denotes those forms of petitions in which something definite is asked. In this way the two words agree with each other, as genus and species. ᾿Εντεύξεις is the word commonly used by Paul to signify those prayers which we offer for 				one another. The word used for it in the Latin Translation is “<a name="iii.iv.i-p14.1"></a>intercessiones,” <i>intercessions</i>. Yet Plato, in his second dialogue, styled Alcibiades, uses it in a different sense, to moan a definite petition offered by a person for himself; and in the very inscription of the book, and in many passages, he shows plainly, as I have said, 				that προσευχὴ is a general term.   				 <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p16"></a>But not to dwell longer than is proper on a matter that is not essential, Paul, in my own opinion, simply enjoins that, whenever public prayers are offered, petitions and supplications should be made <i>for all men</i>, even for those who at present are not at all related to us. And yet this heaping up of words is not superfluous; but Paul appears to me purposely to join together three terms for the same purpose, in order to recommend 				more warmly, and urge more strongly, earnest and constant prayer. We know now sluggish we are in this religious duty; and therefore we need not wonder if, for the purpose of arousing us to it, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, employs various excitements.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p17"></a><i>And thanksgivings</i>. As to this term, there is no obscurity; for, as he bids us make supplication to God for the salvation of unbelievers, so also to give thanks on account of their prosperity and success. That wonderful goodness which he shews every day, when</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.i-p18"></a>“he maketh his sun to rise on the good and the bad,”<br> 				(<a name="iii.iv.i-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045">Mt 5:45</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p18.2"></a>,)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p19"></a>is worthy of being praised; and our love of our neighbor ought also to extend to those who are unworthy of it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p20"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p20.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p21"></a><b>2</b> <i>For kings</i>  He expressly mentions kings and other magistrates because, more than all others, they might be hated by Christians. All the magistrates who existed at that time were so many sworn enemies of Christ; and therefore this thought might occur to them, that they ought not to pray for those who devoted all their 				power and all their wealth to fight against the kingdom of Christ, the extension of which is above all things desirable. The apostle meets this difficulty, and expressly enjoins Christians to pray for them also. And, indeed, the depravity of men is not a reason why God’s ordinance should not be loved. Accordingly, seeing that God appointed magistrates and princes for the preservation of mankind, however much they fall short of the divine appointment, still we must not on that account cease to 				love what belongs to God, and to desire that it may remain in force. That is the reason why believers, in whatever country they live, must not only obey the laws and the government of magistrates, but likewise in their prayers supplicate God for their salvation. Jeremiah said to the Israelites,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.i-p22"></a>“Pray for the peace of Babylon, for in their peace ye shall have peace.” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007">Jer 29:7</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p22.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p23"></a>The universal doctrine is this, that we should desire the continuance and peaceful condition of those governments which have been appointed by God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p24"></a><i>That we may lead a peaceful and quiet life</i>  By exhibiting the advantage, he holds out an additional inducement, for he enumerates the fruits which are yielded to us by a well regulated government. The first is a <i>peaceful life</i>; for magistrates are armed with the sword, in order to keep us in peace. If they did not restrain 				the hardihood of wicked men, every place would be full of robberies and murders. The true way of maintaining peace, therefore, is, when every one obtains what is his own, and the violence of the more powerful is kept under restraint.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p25"></a><i>With all godliness and decency</i>  The second fruit is the preservation of <i>godliness</i>, that is, when magistrates give themselves to promote religion, to maintain the worship of God, and to take care that sacred ordinances be observed with due reverence. The third fruit is the care of public <i>decency</i>; for it is also the business of magistrates to prevent men from abandoning themselves to brutal filthiness or flagitious conduct, but, on the contrary, to promote decency and moderation. If these three things are taken away, what will be the condition of human life? If, therefore, we are at all moved by solicitude about the peace of society, or godliness, or decency, let us remember that we ought also to be solicitous about those through whose agency 				we obtain such distinguished benefits.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p26"></a>Hence we conclude, that fanatics, who wish to have magistrates taken away, are destitute of all humanity, and breathe nothing but cruel barbarism. How different is it to say, that we ought to pray for kings, in order that justice and decency may prevail, and to say, that not only the name of kingly power, but all government, is opposed to religion! We have the Spirit of God for the Author of the former sentiment, and therefore the latter 				must be from the Devil.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p27"></a>If any one ask, Ought we to pray for kings, from whom we obtain none of these advantages? I answer, the object of our prayer is, that, guided by the Spirit of God, they may begin to impart to us those benefits of which they formerly deprived us. It is our duty, therefore, not only to pray for those who are already worthy, but we must pray to God that he may make bad men good. We must always hold by this principle, that magistrates were 				appointed by God for the protection of religion, as well as of the peace and decency of society, in exactly the same manner that the earth is appointed to produce food.   				 <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
  				Accordingly, in like manner as, when we pray to God for our daily bread, we ask him to make the earth fertile by his blessing; so in those benefits of which we have already spoken, we ought to consider the ordinary means which he has appointed by his providence for bestowing them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p29"></a>To this must be added, that, if we are deprived of those benefits the communication of which Paul assigns to magistrates, that is through our own fault. It is the wrath of God that renders magistrates useless to us, in the same manner that it renders the earth barren; and, therefore, we ought to pray for the removal of those chastisements which have been brought upon us by our sins.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p30"></a>On the other hand, princes, and all who hold the office of magistracy, are here reminded of their duty. It is not enough, if, by giving to every one what is due, they restrain all acts of violence, and maintain peace; but they must likewise endeavor to promote religion, and to regulate morals by wholesome discipline. The exhortation of David (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012">Ps 2:12</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></a>) 				to “kiss the Son,” and the prophecy of Isaiah, that they shall be nursing — fathers of the Church, (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023">Isa 49:23</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></a>,) are not without meaning; and, therefore, they have no right to flatter themselves, if they neglect to lend their assistance to maintain the worship of God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p31"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p31.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p32"></a><b>3</b> <i>For this is good and acceptable before God</i>. After having taught that what he enjoined is useful, he now brings forward a stronger argument — that it pleases God; for when we know what is His will, this ought to have the force of all possible reasons. By <i>good</i> he means 				what is proper and lawful; and, since the will of God is the rule by which all our duties must be regulated, he proves that it is right because it pleases God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p33"></a>This passage is highly worthy of observation; and, first, we draw from it the general doctrine, that the true rule for acting well and properly is to look to the will of God, and not to undertake anything but what he approves. Next, there is likewise laid down a rule for godly prayer, that we should follow God as our leader, and that all our prayer should be regulated by his will and command. If due force had been allowed to this 				argument, the prayers of Papists, in the present day, would not have abounded with so many corruptions. For how will they prove that they have the authority of God for having recourse to dead men as their intercessors, or for praying for the dead? In short, in all their form of prayer, what can they point out that is pleasing to God?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p34"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p34.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p35"></a><b>4</b> <i>Who wishes that all men may be saved</i>. Here follows a confirmation of the second argument; and what is more reasonable than that all our prayers should be in conformity with this decree of God?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p36"></a><i>And may come to the acknowledgment of the truth</i>. Lastly, he demonstrates that God has at heart the salvation of all, because he invites all to the acknowledgment of his truth. This belongs to that kind of argument in which the cause is proved from the effect; for, if</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.i-p37"></a>“the gospel is the power of God for salvation to every one that believeth,” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016">Ro 1:16</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></a>,)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p38"></a>it is certain that all those to whom the gospel is addressed are invited to the hope of eternal life. In short, as the calling is a proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes partakers of his gospel are admitted by him to possess salvation; because the gospel reveals to us the righteousness of God, which is a sure entrance into life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p39"></a>Hence we see the childish folly of those who represent this passage to be opposed to predestination. “If God” say they, “wishes all men indiscriminately to be saved, it is false that some are predestined by his eternal purpose to salvation, and others to perdition.” They might have had some ground for saying this, if Paul were speaking here about individual men; although even then we should not have wanted the means of replying to their 				argument; for, although the will of God ought not to be judged from his secret decrees, when he reveals them to us by outward signs, yet it does not therefore follow that he has not determined with himself what he intends to do as to every individual man.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p40"></a>But I say nothing on that subject, because it has nothing to do with this passage; for the Apostle simply means, that there is no people and no rank in the world that is excluded from salvation; because God wishes that the gospel should be proclaimed to all without exception. Now the preaching of the gospel gives life; and hence he justly concludes that God invites all equally to partake salvation. But the present discourse relates to 				classes of men, and not to individual persons; for his sole object is, to include in this number princes and foreign nations. That God wishes the doctrine of salvation to be enjoyed by them as well as others, is evident from the passages already quoted, and from other passages of a similar nature. Not without good reason was it said, “Now, kings, understand,” and again, in the same Psalm,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.i-p41"></a>“I will give thee the Gentiles for an inheritance, and the ends of the earth for a possession.” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p41.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008">Ps 2:8-10</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p41.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p42"></a>In a word, Paul intended to shew that it is our duty to consider, not what kind of persons the princes at that time were, but what God wished them to be. Now the duty arising out of that love which we owe to our neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do our endeavor for the salvation of all whom God includes in his calling, and to testify this by godly prayers.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p43"></a>With the same view does he call <i>God our Savior</i>; for whence do we obtain salvation but from the undeserved kindness of God? Now the same God who has already made us partakers of salvation may sometime extend his grace to them also. He who hath already drawn us to him may draw them along with us. The Apostle takes for granted that God will do so, because it had been thus 				foretold by the predictions of the prophets, concerning all ranks and all nations.</p>  <a name="iii.iv.ii"></a>  			  				 				     				  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p1"></a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p2"></a><b>5</b>. For <i>there is </i>one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p3"></a><b>5</b>. Unus enim Deus, unus et Mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus Iesus,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p4"></a><b>6</b>. Who gave himself for all, to be testified in due time.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p5"></a><b>6</b>. Qui dedit semetipsum pretium redemtionis pro omnibus, (<i>ut esset</i>) testimonium temporibus suis,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p6"></a><b>7</b>. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <i>and</i> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p7"></a><b>7</b>. In quod positus sum praeco et Apostolus: veritatem dico in Christo, non menitor, Doctor Gentium in fide et veritate.</p> 				    				  			   			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p8"></a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p9"></a><b>5</b> <i>For there is one God</i>  This argument might, at first sight, appear to be not very strong, that God wishes all men to be saved, because he is one; if a transition had not been made from God to men. Chrysostom — and, after him, others — view it in this sense, that there are not many gods, as idolaters imagine. But I think 				that Paul’s design was different, and that there is here an implied comparison of one God with the whole world and with various nations, out of which comparison arises a view of both, as they mutually regard each other. In like manner the Apostle says,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p10"></a>“Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yea, it is one God who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.’ (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029">Ro 3:29</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p11"></a>Accordingly, whatever diversity might at that time exist among men, because many ranks and many nations were strangers to faith, Paul brings to the remembrance of believers the unity of God, that they may know that they are connected with all, because there is one God of all — that they may know that they who are under the power of the same God are not excluded for ever from the hope of salvation.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p12"></a><i>And one Mediator between God and men</i>  This clause is of a similar import with the former; for, as there is one God, the Creator and Father of all, so he says that there is but one Mediator,   				 <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">33</font></a>
  				 through whom we have access to the Father; and that this Mediator was given, not only to one nation, or to a small number of persons of some particular rank, but to all; because the fruit of the sacrifice, by which he made atonement for sins, extends to all. More especially because a large portion of the world was at that time alienated from God, he expressly mentions the Mediator, through whom they that were afar off now approach.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p14"></a>The universal term <i>all </i>must always be referred to classes: of men, and not to persons; as if he had said, that not only Jews, but Gentiles also, not only persons of humble rank, but princes also, were redeemed by the death of Christ. Since, therefore, he wishes the benefit of his death to be common to all, an insult is offered to him by those who, by their opinion, shut out any person from the hope of salvation.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p15"></a><i>The man Christ Jesus</i>. When he declares that he is “a man,” the Apostle does not deny that the Mediator is God, but, intending to point out the bond of our union with God, he mentions the human nature rather than the divine. This ought to be carefully observed. From the beginning, men, by contriving for themselves this or that mediator, departed farther from God; and the reason was, that, being 				prejudiced in favor of this error, that God was at a great distance from them, they knew not to what hand to turn. Paul remedies this evil, when he represents God as present with us; for he has descended even to us, so that we do not need to seek him above the clouds. The same thing is said in <a name="iii.iv.ii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015">Heb 4:15</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p15.1"></a>,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p16"></a>“We have not a high priest who cannot sympathize within our infirmities, for in all things he was tempted.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p17"></a>And, indeed, if this were deeply impressed on the hearts of all, that the Son of God holds out to us the hand of a brother, and that we are united to him by the fellowship of our nature, in order that, out of our low condition, he may raise us to heaven; who would not choose to keep by this straight road, instead of wandering in uncertain and stormy paths! Accordingly, whenever we ought to pray to God, if we call to remembrance that 				exalted and unapproachable majesty, that we may not be driven back by the dread of it, let us, at the same time, remember “the man Christ,” who gently invites us, and takes us, as it were, by the hand, in order that the Father, who had been the object of terror and alarm, may be reconciled by him and rendered friendly to us. This is the only key to open for us the gate of the heavenly kingdom, that we may appear in the presence of God with confidence.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p18"></a>Hence we see, that Satan has, in all ages, followed this course, for the purpose of leading men astray from the right path. I say nothing of the various devices by which, before the coming of Christ, he alienated the minds of men, to contrive methods of approaching to God. At the very commencement of the Christian Church, when Christ, with so excellent a pledge, was fresh in their remembrance, and while the earth was still ringing with 				that delightfully sweet word from his mouth,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p19"></a>“Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,<br> 				and I will give you rest,” (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mt 11:28</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></a>,)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p20"></a>there were, nevertheless, some persons skilled in deception, who thrust angels into his room as mediators; which is evident from <a name="iii.iv.ii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p20.1"></a>. But what Satan, at that time, contrived secretly, he carried to such a pitch, during the times of Popery, that scarcely one person in a thousand acknowledged Christ, even in words, to be the Mediator. And 				while the name was buried, still more was the reality unknown.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p21"></a>Now that God has raised up good and faithful teachers, who have labored to restore and bring to the remembrance of men what ought to have been one of the best-known principles of our faith, the sophists of the Church of Rome have resorted to every contrivance for darkening a point so clear. First, the name is so hateful to them, that, if any one mentions Christ as Mediator, without taking notice of the saints, he instantly falls under a 				suspicion of heresy. But, because they do not venture to reject altogether what Paul teaches in this passage, they evade it by a foolish exposition, that he is called “one Mediator,” not “the only Mediator.” As if the Apostle had mentioned God as one out of a vast multitude of gods; for the two clauses are closely connected, that “there is one God and one Mediator;” and therefore they who make Christ one out of many mediators must apply the same interpretation in speaking of God. Would they 				rise to such a height of impudence, if they were not impelled by blind rage to crush the glory of Christ?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p22"></a>There are others who think themselves more acute, and who lay down this distinction, that Christ is the only Mediator of redemption, while they pronounce the saints to be mediators of intercession. But the folly of these interpreters is reproved by the scope of the passage, in which the Apostle speaks expressly about prayer. The Holy Spirit commands us to pray for all, because our only Mediator admits all to come to him; just as by his 				death he reconciled all to the Father. And yet they who thus, with daring sacrilege, strip Christ of his honor, wish to be regarded as Christians.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p23"></a>But it is objected that this has the appearance of contradiction; for in this very passage Paul enjoins us to intercede for others, while, in the Epistle to the Romans, he declares that intercession belongs to Christ alone. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034">Ro 8:34</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p23.1"></a>.) I reply, the intercessions of the saints, by which they aid each other in their addresses to God, do not contradict 				the doctrine, that all have but one Intercessor; for no man’s prayers are heard either in behalf of himself, or in behalf of another, unless he rely on Christ as his advocate. When we intercede for one another, this is so far from setting aside the intercession of Christ, as belonging to him alone, that the chief reliance is given, and the chief reference made, to that very intercession.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p24"></a>Some person will perhaps think, that it will, therefore, be easy for us to come to an agreement with the Papists, if they place below the only intercession of Christ, all that they ascribe to the saints. This is not the case; for the reason why they transfer to the saints the office of interceding is, that they imagine that otherwise we are destitute of an advocate. It is a common opinion among them, that we need intercessors, because in 				ourselves we are unworthy of appearing in the presence of God. By speaking in this manner, they deprive Christ of his honor. Besides, it is a shocking blasphemy, to ascribe to saints such excellence as would procure for us the favor of God: and all the prophets, and apostles, and martyrs, and even the angels themselves — are so far from making any pretension to this, that they too have need of the same intercession as ourselves.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p25"></a>Again, it is a mere dream, originating in their own brain, that the dead intercede for us; and, therefore, to found our prayers on this is altogether to withdraw our trust from calling upon God. But Paul lays down, as the rule for calling on God in a proper manner, faith grounded on the word of God. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">Ro 10:17</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p25.1"></a>.) Justly, therefore, everything that 				men contrive, in the exercise of their own thoughts, without the authority of the word of God, is rejected by us.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p26"></a>But not to dwell on this subject longer than the exposition of the passage demands, let it be summed up in this manner; that they who have actually learned the office of Christ will be satisfied with having him alone, and that none will make mediators at their own pleasure but those who neither know God nor Christ. Hence I conclude, that the doctrine of the Papists — which darkens, and almost buries, the intercession of Christ, and 				introduces pretended intercessors without any support from Scripture — is full of wicked distrust, and also of wicked rashness.</p>

  				 The mention of redemption in this passage is not superfluous; for there is a necessary connection between the two things, the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and his continual intercession. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.16"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034">Ro 8:34</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.16"></a>.) These are the two parts of his priesthood; for, when Christ is called our priest, it is in this sense, that he once made atonement for our sins by 				his death, that he might reconcile us to God; and now having entered into the sanctuary of heaven, he appears in presence of the Father, in order to obtain grace for us, that we may be heard in his name. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.17"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Ps 110:4</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.17"></a>; <a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.18"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017">Heb 7:17</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.18"></a>.) So much the more does he expose the 				wicked sacrilege of the Papists, who, by making dead saints to be companions of Christ in this affair, transfer to them likewise the glory of the priesthood. Read the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, towards the conclusion, and the beginning of the fifth chapter, [<a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.19"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014">Heb 4:14-5:10</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.19"></a>,] and you will find what I maintain, that the intercession by which God is 				reconciled to us is founded on the sacrifice; which, indeed, is demonstrated by the whole system of the ancient priesthood. It follows, therefore, that it is impossible to take from Christ any part of the office of intercession, and bestow it on others, without stripping him of the title of priesthood.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p30"></a>Besides, when the Apostle calls him ἀντίλυτρον, <i>“</i>a ransom,”   				 <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
  				 he overthrows all other satisfactions. Yet I am not ignorant of the injurious devices of the Papists, who pretend that the price of redemption, which Christ paid by his death, is applied to us in baptism, so that original sin is effaced, and that afterwards we are reconciled to God by satisfactions. In this way they limit to a small period of time, and to a single class, that benefit which was universal and perpetual. But a full illustration of this subject will 				be found in the Institutes.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p32"></a><i>That there might be a testimony in due time; </i>that is, in order that this grace might be revealed at the appointed time. The phrase, <i>for all, </i>which the Apostle had used, might have given rise to the question, “Why then had God chosen a peculiar people, if he revealed himself as a reconciled Father to all without 				distinction, and if the one redemption through Christ was common to all?” He cuts off all ground for that question, by referring to the purpose of God the season   				 <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">36</font></a>
  				 for revealing his grace. For if we are not astonished that in winter, the trees are stripped of their foliage, the fields are covered with snow, and the meadows are stiff with frost, and that, by the genial warmth of spring, what appeared for a time to be dead, begins to revive, because God appointed the seasons to follow in succession; why should we not allow the same authority to his providence in other matters? Shall we accuse God of instability, because he 				brings forward, at the proper time, what he had always determined, and settled in his own mind?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p34"></a>Accordingly, although it came upon the world suddenly and was altogether unexpected, that Christ was revealed as a Redeemer to Jews and Gentiles, without distinction; let us not think that it was sudden with respect to God but, on the contrary, let us learn to subject all our sense to his wonderful providence. The consequence will be, that there will be nothing that comes from him which shall not appear to us to be highly seasonable. On 				that account this admonition frequently occurs in the writings of Paul and especially when he treats of the calling of the Gentiles, by which, at that time, on account of its novelty, many persons were startled and almost confounded. They who are not satisfied with this solution, that God, by his hidden wisdom, arranged the succession of the seasons, will one day feel, that, at the time when they think that he was idle, he was framing a hell for inquisitive persons.</p>

And on this account he labors very hard in asserting it, as there are many who received it with no small difficulty.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p37"></a><i>I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie</i>.

  				 in order that we may call on God in a proper manner. Thus, after having exhibited the grace of Christ to all, and after having mentioned that he was given to the Gentiles for the express purpose, that they might enjoy the same benefit of redemption in common with the Jews, he invites all in the same manner to pray; for faith leads to calling on God.

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p16"></a>The material argument holds good, from faith to prayer, and from prayer to faith, whether we reason from the cause to the effect, or from the effect to the cause. This is worthy of observation, because it reminds us that God reveals himself to us in his word, that we may call upon him; and this is the chief exercise of faith.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p19"></a>so that there is now no difference between Gentile and Jew, between Greek and barbarian, because all in common have God as their Father; and in Christ is now fulfilled what Malachi had foretold, that not only in Judea, but throughout the whole world, pure sacrifices are offered. (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011">Mal 1:11</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p19.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p20"></a><i>Lifting up pure hands</i>  As if he had said, “Provided that it be accompanied by a good conscience, there will be nothing to prevent all the nations from calling upon God everywhere. But he has employed the sign instead of the reality, for “pure hands” are the expressions of a pure heart; just as, on the contrary, Isaiah rebukes the Jews for lifting up “bloody hands,” when 				he attacks their cruelty. (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015">Isa 1:15</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></a>.) Besides, this attitude has been generally used in worship during all ages; for it is a feeling which nature has implanted in us, when we ask God, to look upwards, and has always been so strong, that even idolaters themselves, although in other respects they make a god of images of wood and stone, still retained the custom of lifting up their 				hands to heaven. Let us therefore learn that the attitude is in accordance with true godliness, provided that it be attended by the corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely, that, having been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first, we should form no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and, secondly, that we should lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing may prevent our hearts from rising above the world. But idolaters and hypocrites, when they lift up 				their hands in prayer, are apes; for while they profess, by the outward symbol, that their minds are raised upwards, the former are fixed on wood and stone, as if God were shut up in them, and the latter, wrapped up either in useless anxieties, or in wicked thoughts, cleave to the earth; and therefore, by a gesture of an opposite meaning,   				 <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
  				 they bear testimony against themselves.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p22"></a><i>Without wrath</i>  Some explain this to mean a burst of indignation, when the conscience fights with itself, and, so to speak, quarrels with God which usually happens when adversity presses heavily upon us; for then we are displeased that God does not send us immediate assistance, and are agitated by impatience. Faith is also shaken by various assaults; for, in consequence 				of his assistance not being visible, we are seized with doubts, whether or not he cares about us, or wishes us to be saved, and things of that nature.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p23"></a>They who take this view think that the word <i>disputing </i>denotes that alarm which arises from doubt. Thus, according to them, the meaning would be, that we should pray with a peaceful conscience and assured confidence. Chrysostom and others think that the apostle here demands that our minds should be calm and free from all uneasy feelings both towards God and towards men; because there is nothing that tends more to hinder pure 				calling on God than quarrels and strife. On this account Christ enjoins, that if any man be at variance with his brother, he shall go and be reconciled to him before offering his gift on the altar.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p24"></a>For my part, I acknowledge that both of these views are just; but when I take into consideration the context of this passage, I have no doubt that Paul had his eye on the disputes which arose out of the indignation of the Jews at having the Gentiles made equal to themselves, in consequence of which they raised a controversy about the calling of the Gentiles, and went so far as to reject and exclude them from the participation of grace. 				Paul therefore wishes that debates of this nature should be put down, and that all the children of God of every nation and country should pray with one heart. Yet there is nothing to restrain us from drawing from this particular statement a general doctrine.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p26"></a><b>9</b> <i> In like manner also women</i>  As he enjoined men to lift up pure hands, so he now prescribes the manner in which women ought to prepare for praying aright. And there appears to be an implied contrast between those virtues which he recommends and the outward sanctification of the Jews; for he intimates that there is no 				profane place, nor any from which both men and women may not draw near to God, provided they are not excluded by their vices.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p27"></a>He intended to embrace the opportunity of correcting a vice to which women are almost always prone, and which perhaps at Ephesus, being a city of vast wealth and extensive merchandise, especially abounded. That vice is — excessive eagerness and desire to be richly dressed. He wishes therefore that their dress should be regulated by modesty and sobriety; for luxury and immoderate expense arise from a desire to make a display either for 				the sake of pride or of departure from chastity. And hence we ought to derive the rule of moderation; for, since dress is an indifferent matter, (as all outward matters are,) it is difficult to assign a fixed limit, how far we ought to go. Magistrates may indeed make laws, by means of which a rage for superfluous expenditure shall be in some measure restrained; but godly teachers, whose business it is to guide the consciences, ought always to keep in view the end of lawful use. This at 				least will be settled beyond all controversy, that every thing in dress which is not in accordance with modesty and sobriety must be disapproved.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p28"></a>Yet we must always begin with the dispositions; for where debauchery reigns within, there will be no chastity; and where ambition reigns within, there will be no modesty in the outward dress. But because hypocrites commonly avail themselves of all the pretexts that they can find for concealing their wicked dispositions, we are under the necessity of pointing out what meets the eye. It would be great baseness to deny the appropriateness 				of modesty as the peculiar and constant ornament of virtuous and chaste women, or the duty of all to observe moderation. Whatever is opposed to these virtues it will be in vain to excuse. He expressly censures certain kinds of superfluity, such as curled hair, jewels, and golden rings; not that the use of gold or of jewels is expressly forbidden, but that, wherever they are prominently displayed, these things commonly draw along with them the other evils which I have mentioned, and arise from 				ambition or from want of chastity as their source.</p>

On this subject we have explained our views in the exposition of the First Epistle to the Corinthians.   				 <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">39</font></a>
  				 If any one bring forward, by way of objection, Deborah (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004">Jud 4:4</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p16.2"></a>) and others of the same class, of whom we read that they were at one time appointed by the command of God to govern the people, the answer is easy. Extraordinary acts done by God do not overturn the ordinary rules of government, by which he intended that we should be bound. Accordingly, if 				women at one time held the office of prophets and teachers, and that too when they were supernaturally called to it by the Spirit of God, He who is above all law might do this; but, being a peculiar case,   				 <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">40</font></a>
  				 this is not opposed to the constant and ordinary system of government.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p18"></a>He adds — what is closely allied to the office of teaching — <i>and not to assume authority over the man; </i>for the very reason, why they are forbidden to teach, is, that it is not permitted by their condition. They are subject, and to teach implies the rank of power or authority. Yet it may be thought that there is no great force in this argument; 				because even prophets and teachers are subject to kings and to other magistrates. I reply, there is no absurdity in the same person commanding and likewise obeying, when viewed in different relations. But this does not apply to the case of woman, who by nature (that is, by the ordinary law of God) is formed to obey; for γυναικοκρατία (the government of women) has always been regarded by all wise persons as a monstrous 				thing; and, therefore, so to speak, it will be a mingling of heaven and earth, if women usurp the right to teach. Accordingly, he bids them be “quiet,” that is, keep within their own rank.   				 <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">41</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p20"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p20.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p21"></a><b>13</b> <i>For Adam was first created</i> He assigns two reasons why women ought to be subject to men; because not only did God enact this law at the beginning, but he also inflicted it as a punishment on the woman. (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016">Ge 3:16</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p21.1"></a>.) He accordingly shews that, although mankind had stood in their first and original uprightness, the true order of nature, which proceeded from the command of God, bears that women shall be subject. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that Adam, by falling from his first dignity, deprived himself of his authority; for in the ruins, which followed sin, there still linger some remains of the divine blessing, and it was not proper that woman, by her own fault, should make her 				condition better than before.   				 <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">42</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p23"></a>Yet the reason that Paul assigns, that woman was second in the order of creation, appears not to be a very strong argument in favor of her subjection; for John the Baptist was before Christ in the order of time, and yet was greatly inferior in rank. But although Paul does not state all the circumstances which are related by Moses, yet he intended that his readers should take them into consideration. Now Moses shews that the woman was 				created afterwards, in order that she might be a kind of appendage to the man; and that she was joined to the man on the express condition, that she should be at hand to render obedience to him.

  				 (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016">Ge 3:16</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p27.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p28"></a>Because she had given fatal advice, it was right that she should learn that she was under the power and will of another; and because she had drawn her husband aside from the command of God, it was right that she should be deprived of all liberty and placed under the yoke. Besides, the Apostle does not rest his argument entirely or absolutely on the cause of the transgression, but founds it on the sentence which was pronounced by God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p29"></a>Yet it may be thought that these two statements are somewhat contradictory: that the subjection of the woman is the punishment of her transgression, and yet that it was imposed on her from the creation; for thence it will follow, that she was doomed to servitude before she sinned. I reply, there is nothing to hinder that the condition of obeying should be natural from the beginning, and that afterwards the accidental condition of serving 				should come into existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable than it had formerly been.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p30"></a>Again, this passage has given to some people an occasion for affirming that Adam did not fall by means of error, but that he was only overcome by the allurements of his wife. Accordingly, they think that the woman only was deceived by the wiles of the devil, to believe that she and her husband would be like the gods; But that Adam was not at all persuaded of this, but tasted the fruit in order to please his wife. But it is easy to refute 				this opinion; for, if Adam had not given credit to the falsehood of Satan, God would not have reproached him:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p31"></a>“Behold, Adam is become like one of us.” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022">Ge 3:22</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p31.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p32"></a>There are other reasons of which I say nothing; for there needs not a long refutation of an error which does not rest on any probable conjecture. By these words Paul does not mean that Adam was not entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil,   				 <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">44</font></a>
  				but that the cause or source of the transgression proceeded from Eve.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p34"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p34.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p35"></a><b>15</b> <i> But she shall be saved</i> The weakness of the sex renders women more suspicious and timid, and the preceding statement might greatly terrify and alarm the strongest minds. For these reasons he modifies what he had said by adding a consolation; for the Spirit of God does not accuse or reproach us, in order to triumph 				over us, when we are covered with shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up. It might have the effect (as I have already said) of striking terror into the minds of women,   				 <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">45</font></a>
  				 when they were informed that the destruction of the whole human race was attributed to them; for what will be this condemnation? Especially when their subjection, as a testimony of the wrath of God, is constantly placed before their eyes. Accordingly, Paul, in order to comfort them and render their condition tolerable, informs them that they continue to enjoy the hope of salvation, though they suffer a temporal punishment. It is proper to observe that the good 				effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by the hope of salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling into despair through alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they become accustomed to endure calmly and patiently the necessity of servitude, so as to submit willingly to their husbands, when they are informed that this kind of obedience is both profitable to themselves and acceptable to God. If this passage be tortured, as Papists are wont to do, to support the 				righteousness of works, the answer is easy. The Apostle does not argue here about the cause of salvation, and therefore we cannot and must not infer from these words what works deserve; but they only shew in what way God conducts us to salvation, to which he has appointed us through his grace.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p37"></a><i>Through child-bearing</i>  To censorious men it might appear absurd, for an Apostle of Christ not only to exhort women to give attention to the birth of offspring, but to press this work as religious and holy to such an extent as to represent it in the light of the means of procuring salvation. Nay, we even see with what reproaches the conjugal bed has been slandered by 				hypocrites, who wished to be thought more holy than all other men. But there is no difficulty in replying to these sneers of the ungodly. First, here the Apostle does not speak merely about having children, but about enduring all the distresses, which are manifold and severe, both in the birth and in the rearing of children. Secondly, whatever hypocrites or wise men of the world may think of it, when a woman, considering to what she has been called, submits to the condition which God has 				assigned to her, and does not refuse to endure the pains, or rather the fearful anguish, of parturition, or anxiety about her offspring, or anything else that belongs to her duty, God values this obedience more highly than if, in some other manner, she made a great display of heroic virtues, while she refused to obey the calling of God. To this must be added, that no consolation could be more appropriate or more efficacious then to shew that the very means (so to speak) of procuring salvation 				are found in the punishment itself.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p38"></a><i>If they continue in faith</i> In consequence of the old translation having used the expression, “the birth of children,” it has been commonly thought that this clause refers to the children. But the term used by Paul to denote “child-bearing” is a single word, τεκνογονία, and therefore it must refer to the women. As to the 				verb being plural, and the noun singular, this involves no difficulty; for an indefinite noun, at least when it denotes a multitude, has the force of a collective noun, and therefore easily admits a change from the singular to the plural number.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p39"></a>Besides, that he might not represent all the virtue of women as included in the duties of marriage, immediately afterwards he adds greater virtues, in which it is proper that godly women should excel, that they may differ from irreligious women. Even “child-bearing” is obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it proceeds <i>from faith and love</i> To these two he adds <i>sanctification, </i>which includes all the purity of life which becomes Christian women. Lastly follows <i>sobriety, </i>which he formerly mentioned, while he was speaking about dress; but now he extends it more widely to the other parts of life.</p>
