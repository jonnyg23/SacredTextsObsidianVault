 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p3"></a><b>2 </b>To Philemon our friend and fellow-laborer, and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p4"></a><b>3 </b>Grace (be) to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p5"></a><b>4 </b>I give thanks to my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p6"></a><b>5 </b>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus and towards all saints,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p7"></a><b>6 </b>That the communication of thy faith may be effectual, by the knowledge of every good thing which is in thee towards Christ Jesus.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p8"></a><b>7 </b>For we have much grace (<i>or, joy</i>) and consolation on account of thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p9"></a><b>8 </b>Wherefore, while I have great confidence in Christ to command thee what is proper, yet for love’s sake I rather entreat thee;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p10"></a><b>9 </b>Being such a one as Paul the aged (<i>or, elder,</i>) and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p11"></a><b>10 </b>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p12"></a><b>11 </b>Onesimus, who formerly was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to thee and to me;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p13"></a><b>12 </b>Whom I have sent back; receive him therefore, that is, my bowels;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p14"></a><b>13 </b>Whom I was desirous to keep beside me, that he might minister to me instead of thee in the bonds of the gospel.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p15"></a><b>14 </b>But without thy opinion I would do nothing, that thy benefit might not be by constraint, but of free choice.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p16"></a><b>15 </b>For perhaps for this reason he was separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him for ever;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p17"></a><b>16 </b>Not now as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p18"></a><b>17 </b>If therefore thou holdest me to be thy associate, receive him as myself.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p19"></a><b>18 </b>And if in anything he hath done thee injury, or oweth thee anything, place it to my account.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p20"></a><b>19 </b>I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will pay it; not to tell thee that thou owest me even thyself.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p21"></a><b>20 </b>Yea, brother, let me enjoy   				 <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">289</font></a>
  				 in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Being convinced of they obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do beyond what I write.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vii.iv.i-p24"></a><b>22 </b>But at the same time prepare for me a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</p>
