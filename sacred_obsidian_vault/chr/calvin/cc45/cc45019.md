 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p12"></a><b>1</b> <i>To the twelve tribes</i>. When the ten tribes were banished, the Assyrian king placed them in different parts. Afterwards, as it usually happens in the revolutions of kingdoms (such as then took place,) it is very probable that they moved here and there in all directions. And the Jews had been scattered 				almost unto all quarters of the world. He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide. But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him, the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations.   				 <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">98</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.i-p16"></a><a name="vi.ii.i-p16.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p17"></a><b>2</b> <i>All joy</i>. The first exhortation is, to bear trials with a cheerful mind. And it was especially necessary at that time to comfort the Jews, almost overwhelmed as they were with troubles. For the very name of the nation was so infamous, that they were hated and despised by all 				people wherever they went; and their condition as Christians rendered them still more miserable, because they held their own nation as their most inveterate enemies. At the same time, this consolation was not so suited to one time, but that it is always useful to believers, whose life is a constant warfare on earth.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p18"></a>But that we may know more fully what he means, we must doubtless take <i>temptations</i> or <i>trials</i> as including all adverse things; and they are so called, because they are the tests of our obedience to God. He bids the faithful, while exercised with these, to rejoice; and that not only 				when they fall into one temptation, but into many, not only of one kind, but of various kinds. And doubtless, since they serve to mortify our flesh, as the vices of the flesh continually shoot up in us, so they must necessarily be often repeated. Besides, as we labor under diseases, so it is no wonder that different remedies are applied to remove them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p19"></a>The Lord then afflicts us in various ways, because ambition, avarice, envy, gluttony, intemperance, excessive love of the world, and the innumerable lusts in which we abound, cannot be cured by the same medicine.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p20"></a>When he bids us to <i>count it all joy</i>, it is the same as though he had said, that temptations ought to be so deemed as gain, as to be regarded as occasions of joy. He means, in short, that there is nothing in afflictions which ought to disturb our joy. And thus, he not only commands us to bear adversities calmly, and with an even 				mind, but shews us that this is a reason why the faithful should rejoice when pressed down by them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p21"></a>It is, indeed, certain, that all the senses of our nature are so formed, that every trial produces in us grief and sorrow; and no one of us can so far divest himself of his nature as not to grieve and be sorrowful whenever he feels any evil. But this does not prevent the children of God to rise, by the guidance of the Spirit, above the sorrow of the flesh. Hence it is, that in the midst of trouble they cease not to rejoice.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.i-p22"></a><a name="vi.ii.i-p22.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p23"></a><b>3</b> <i>Knowing this, that the trying</i>. We now see why he called adversities <i>trials </i>or <i>temptations</i>, even because they serve to try our faith. And there is here a reason given to confirm the last sentence. For it 				might, on the other hand, be objected, “How comes it, that we judge that sweet which to the sense is bitter?” He then shews by the effect that we ought to rejoice in afflictions, because they produce fruit that ought to be highly valued, even patience. If God then provides for our salvation, he affords us an occasion of rejoicing. Peter uses a similar argument at the beginning of his first Epistle, “That the trial of your faith, more precious than gold, may be,” etc. [<a name="vi.ii.i-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">1Pe 1:7</a><a name="vi.ii.i-p23.1"></a>.] We certainly dread diseases, and want, and exile, and prison, and reproach, and death, because we regard them as evils; but when we understand that they are turned through God’s kindness unto helps and aids to our salvation, it is ingratitude to murmur, and not willingly to submit to be thus paternally dealt with.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p24"></a>Paul says, in <a name="vi.ii.i-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Ro 5:3</a><a name="vi.ii.i-p24.1"></a>, that we are to glory in tribulations; and James says here, that we are to rejoice. “We glory,” says Paul, “in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience.” What immediately follows seems contrary to the words of James; for he mentions probation in the third place, as the effect of patience, which is here put first as 				though it were the cause. But the solution is obvious; the word there has an active, but here a passive meaning. Probation or trial is said by James to produce patience; for were not God to try us, but leave us free from trouble, there would be no patience, which is no other thing than fortitude of mind in bearing evils. But Paul means, that while by enduring we conquer evils, we experience how much God’s help avails in necessities; for then the truth of God is as it were in reality manifested 				to us. Hence it comes that we dare to entertain more hope as to futurity; for the truth of God, known by experience, is more fully believed by us. Hence Paul teaches that by such a probation, that is, by such an experience of divine grace, hope is produced, not that hope then only begins, but that it increases and is confirmed. But both mean, that tribulation is the means by which patience is produced.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p25"></a>Moreover, the minds of men are not so formed by nature, that affliction of itself produces patience in them. But Paul and Peter regard not so much the nature of men as the providence of God through which it comes, that the faithful learn patience from troubles; for the ungodly are thereby more and more provoked to madness, as the example of Pharaoh proves.  				 <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">99</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p28"></a><b>4</b> <i>But let patience have her perfect work.</i> As boldness and courage often appear in us and soon fail, he therefore requires perseverance. “Real patience,” he says, “is that which endures to the end.” For <i>work</i> here means the effort not only to overcome in one 				contest, but to persevere through life. His perfection may also he referred to the sincerity of the soul, that men ought willingly and not feignedly to submit to God; but as the word <i>work</i> is added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For there are many, as we have said, who shew at first an heroic greatness, and shortly after grow weary and faint. He therefore bids those who would be <i>perfect</i> and 				<i>entire</i>,   				 <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">100</font></a>
  				 to persevere to the end. But what he means by these two words, he afterwards explains of those who fail not, or become not wearied: for they, who being overcome as to patience, be broken down, must, by degrees, be necessarily weakened, and at length wholly fail.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p12"></a><b>5</b> <i>If any of you lack wisdom.</i> As our reason, and all our feelings are averse to the thought that we can be happy in the midst of evils, he bids us to ask of the Lord to give us wisdom. For <i>wisdom</i> here, I confine to the subject of the passage, as though he 				had said, “If this doctrine is higher than what your minds can reach to, ask of the Lord to illuminate you by his Spirit; for as this consolation alone is sufficient to mitigate all the bitterness of evils, that what is grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we must necessarily be overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this kind of comfort.” Since we see that the Lord does not so require from us what is above our strength, but that he is ready to help us, provided we ask, let 				us, therefore, learn, whenever he commands anything, to ask from him the power to perform it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p13"></a>Though in this place to be wise is to submit to God in the endurance of evils, under a due conviction that he so orders all things as to promote our salvation; yet the sentence may be generally applied to every branch of right knowledge.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p14"></a>But why does he say <i>If any one,</i> as though all of them did not want wisdom. To this I answer, that all are by nature without it; but that some are gifted with the spirit of wisdom, while others are without it. As, then, all had not made such progress as to rejoice in affliction, but few there were to whom this had been given, 				James, therefore, referred to such cases; and he reminded those who were not as yet fully convinced that by the cross their salvation was promoted by the Lord, that they were to ask to be endued with wisdom. And yet there is no doubt, but that necessity reminds us all to ask the same thing; for he who has made the greatest progress, is yet far off from the goal. But to ask an increase of wisdom is another thing than to ask for it at first.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p15"></a>When he bids us to <i>ask of the Lord,</i> he intimates, that he alone can heal our diseases and relieve our wants.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p16"></a><i>That giveth to all men liberally</i>. By <i>all</i>, he means those who ask; for they who seek no remedy for their wants, deserve to pine away in them. However, this universal declaration, by which every one of us is invited to ask, without exception, is very important; hence no man ought to deprive himself of so 				great a privilege.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p17"></a>To the same purpose is the promise which immediately follows; for as by this command he shews what is the duty of every one, so he affirms that they would not do in vain what he commands; according to what is said by Christ,</p>  			 
 <p class="Center"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p18"></a>“Knock, and it shall be opened.”<br> 				(<a name="vi.ii.ii-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007">Mt 7:7</a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p18.2"></a>; <a name="vi.ii.ii-p18.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009">Lu 11:9</a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p18.3"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p19"></a>The word <i>liberally</i>, or <i>freely</i>, denotes promptitude in giving. So Paul, in <a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Ro 12:8</a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.1"></a>, requires simplicity in deacons. And in <a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#000">2Co 8</a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.2"></a> and <a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#000">2Co 9</a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p19.3"></a>, 				when speaking of charity or love, he repeats the same word several times. The meaning, then, is, that God is so inclined and ready to give, that he rejects none, or haughtily puts them off, being not like the niggardly and grasping, who either sparingly, as with a closed hand, give but little, or give only a part of what they were about to give, or long debate with themselves whether to give or not.  				 <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">101</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p21"></a><i>And upbraideth not.</i> This is added, lest any one should fear to come too often to God. Those who are the most liberal among men, when any one asks often to be helped, mention their formal acts of kindness, and thus excuse themselves for the future. Hence, a mortal man, however open-handed he may be, we are ashamed to weary by asking too often. But James 				reminds us, that there is nothing like this in God; for he is ready ever to add new blessings to former ones, without any end or limitation.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p22"></a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p23"></a><b>6</b> <i> But let him ask in faith</i>. He shews here, first the right way of praying; for as we cannot pray without the word, as it were, leading the way, so we must believe before we pray; for we testify by prayer, that we hope to obtain from God the grace which he has promised. Thus every one who has no faith in 				the promises, prays dissemblingly. Hence, also, we learn what is true faith; for James, after having bidden us to ask in faith, adds this explanation, <i>nothing wavering</i>, or, <i>doubting nothing</i>. Then faith is that which relies on God’s promises, and makes us sure of obtaining what we ask. It hence follows, that it is connected with confidence and certainty 				as to God’s love towards us. The verb <a name="vi.ii.ii-p23.1"></a>διακρίνεσθαι, which he uses, means properly to inquire into both sides of a question, after the manner of pleaders. He would have us then to be so convinced of what God has once promised, as not to admit a doubt whether he shall be heard or not.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p24"></a><i>He that wavereth</i>, or <i>doubteth</i>. By this similitude he strikingly expresses how God punishes the unbelief of those who doubt his promises; for, by their own restlessness, they torment themselves inwardly; for there is never any calmness for our souls, except they recumb on the truth of God. He, at length, 				concludes, that such are unworthy to receive anything from God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p25"></a>This is a remarkable passage, fitted to disprove that impious dogma which is counted as an oracle under the whole Papacy, that is, that we ought to pray doubtingly, and with uncertainty as to our success. This principle, then, we hold, that our prayers are not heard by the Lord, except when we have a confidence that we shall obtain. It cannot indeed be otherwise, but that through the infirmity of our flesh we must be tossed by various 				temptations, which are like engines employed to shake our confidence; so that no one is found who does not vacillate and tremble according to the feeling of his flesh; but temptations of this kind are at length to be overcome by faith. The case is the same as with a tree, which has struck firm roots; it shakes, indeed, through the blowing of the wind, but is not rooted up; on the contrary, it remains firm in its own place.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p26"></a><a name="vi.ii.ii-p26.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p class="Super"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p27"></a><b>8</b> <i>A double-minded man</i>, or, <i>a man of a double mind</i>. This sentence may be read by itself, as he speaks generally of hypocrites. It seems, however, to me to be rather the conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and thus there is an implied contrast between the 				simplicity or liberality of God, mentioned before, and the double-mindedness of man; for as God gives to us with a stretched out hand, so it behooves us in our turn to open the bosom of our heart. He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are <i>unstable</i>; because they are never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair.   				 <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">102</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p10"></a><b>9</b> <i>Let the brother of low degree</i>. As Paul, exhorting servants submissively to bear their lot, sets before them this consolation, that they were the free-men of God, having been set free by his grace from the most miserable bondage of Satan, and reminds them, though free, yet to remember that they were 				the servants of God; so here James in the same manner bids the lowly to glory in this, that they had been adopted by the Lord as his children; and the rich, because they had been brought down into the same condition, the world’s vanity having been made evident to them. Thus the first thing he would have to do is to be content with their humble and low state; and he forbids the rich to be proud. Since it is incomparably the greatest dignity to be introduced into the company of angels, nay, to be 				made the associates of Christ, he who estimates this favor of God aright, will regard all other things as worthless. Then neither poverty, nor contempt, nor nakedness, nor famine nor thirst, will make his mind so anxious, but that he will sustain himself with this consolation. “Since the Lord has conferred on me the principal thing, it behooves me patiently to bear the loss of other things, which are inferior.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p11"></a>Behold, how a lowly brother ought to glory in his elevation or exaltation; for if he be accepted of God, he has sufficient consolation in his adoption alone, so as not to grieve unduly for a less prosperous state of life.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p13"></a><b>10</b> <i> But the rich, in that he is made low</i>, or, <i>in his lowness</i>. He has mentioned the particular for the general; for this admonition pertains to all those who excel in honor; or in dignity, or in any other external thing. He bids them to glory in their 				lowness or littleness, in order to repress the haughtiness of those who are usually inflated with prosperity. But he calls it <i>lowness</i>, because the manifested kingdom of God ought to lead us to despise the world, as we know that all the things we previously greatly admired, are either nothing or very little things. For Christ, who is not a teacher except of babes, checks by his doctrine all the haughtiness of the flesh. Lest, then, the vain joy 				of the world should captivate the rich, they ought to habituate themselves to glory in the casting down of their carnal excellency.   				 <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p15"></a><i>As the flower of the grass</i>. Were any one to say that James alludes to the words of Isaiah, I would not much object; but I cannot allow that he quotes the testimony of the Prophet, who speaks not only of the things of this life and the fading character of the world, but of the whole man, both body and soul; [<a name="vi.ii.iii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006">Isa 40:6-8</a><a name="vi.ii.iii-p15.1"></a>;] but here what is spoken of is the pomp of wealth or of riches. And the meaning is, that glorying in riches is foolish and preposterous, because they pass away in a moment. The philosophers teach the same thing; but the song is sung to the deaf, until the ears are opened by the Lord to hear the truth concerning the eternity of the celestial kingdom. Hence he mentions <i>brother</i>; intimating that there is no place for this truth, until we are admitted into the order of God’s children.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p12"></a><b>12</b> <i>Blessed is the man</i>. After having applied consolation, he moderated the sorrow of those who were severely handled in this world, and again humbled the arrogance of the great. He now draws this conclusion, that they are happy who magnanimously endure troubles and other trials, so as to rise above them. 				The word temptation may indeed be otherwise understood, even for the stings of lusts which annoy the soul within; but which is here commended, as I think, is fortitude of mind in enduring adversities. It is, however, a paradox, that they are not happy to whom all things come according to their wishes, but such as are not overcome with evils.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p13"></a><i>For when he is tried</i>. He gives a reason for the preceding sentence; for the crown follows the contest. If, then, it be our chief happiness to be crowned in the kingdom of God, it follows, that the contests with which the Lord tries us, are aids and helps to our happiness. Thus the argument is from the end or the effect: hence we conclude, that the 				faithful are harassed by so many evils for this purpose, that their piety and obedience may be made manifest, and that they may be thus at length prepared to receive the crown of life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p14"></a>But they reason absurdly who hence infer that we by fighting merit the crown; for since God has gratuitously appointed it for us, our fighting only renders us fit to receive it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p15"></a>He adds, that it is <i>promised</i> to those who <i>love</i> God. By speaking thus, he means not that the love of man is the cause of obtaining the crown, (for God anticipates us by his gratuitous love;) but he only intimates that the elect who love him are alone approved by God. He then reminds us that the conquerors of all temptations are those who love God, and that we fail not in courage when we are tried, for no other cause than 				because the love of the world prevails in us.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p17"></a><b>13</b>  <i>Let no man, when he is tempted</i>. Here, no doubt, he speaks of another kind of temptation. It is abundantly evident that the external temptations, hitherto mentioned, are sent to us by God. In this way God tempted Abraham, (<a name="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001">Ge 22:1</a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></a>,) and daily tempts us, that is, he tries us as to what are we by laying before us an occasion by which our hearts are made known. But to draw out what is hid in our hearts is a far different thing from inwardly alluring our hearts by wicked lusts.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p18"></a>He then treats here of inward temptations which are nothing else than the inordinate desires which entice to sin. He justly denies that God is the author of these, because they flow from the corruption of our nature.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p19"></a>This warning is very necessary, for nothing is more common among men than to transfer to another the blame of the evils they commit; and they then especially seem to free themselves, when they ascribe it to God himself. This kind of evasion we constantly imitate, delivered down to us as it is from the first man. For this reason James calls us to confess our own guilt, and not to implicate God, as though he compelled us to sin.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p20"></a>But the whole doctrine of scripture seems to be inconsistent with this passage; for it teaches us that men are blinded by God, are given up to a reprobate mind, and delivered over to filthy and shameful lusts. To this I answer, that probably James was induced to deny that we are tempted by God by this reason, because the ungodly, in order to form an excuse, armed themselves with testimonies of Scripture. But there are two things to be 				noticed here: when Scripture ascribes blindness or hardness of heart to God, it does not assign to him the beginning of this blindness, nor does it make him the author of sin, so as to ascribe to him the blame: and on these two things only does James dwell.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p21"></a>Scripture asserts that the reprobate are delivered up to depraved lusts; but is it because the Lord depraves or corrupts their hearts? By no means; for their hearts are subjected to depraved lusts, because they are already corrupt and vicious. But since God blinds or hardens, is he not the author or minister of evil? Nay, but in this manner he punishes sins, and renders a just reward to the ungodly, who have refused to be ruled by his 				Spirit. (<a name="vi.ii.iv-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026">Ro 1:26</a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p21.1"></a>.) It hence follows that the origin of sin is not in God, and no blame can be imputed to him as though he took pleasure in evils. (<a name="vi.ii.iv-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006">Ge 6:6</a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p21.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p22"></a>The meaning is, that man in vain evades, who attempts to cast the blame of his vices on God, because every evil proceeds from no other fountain than from the wicked lust of man. And the fact really is, that we are not otherwise led astray, except that every one has his own inclination as his leader and impeller. But that God tempts no one, he proves by this, because he is <i>not tempted with evils</i>   				 <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>
  				 For it is the devil who allures us to sin, and for this reason, because he wholly burns with the mad lust of sinning. But God does not desire what is evil: he is not, therefore, the author of doing evil in us.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p26"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p26.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p27"></a><b>14</b> <i>When he is drawn away by his own lust.</i> As the inclination and excitement to sin are inward, in vain does the sinner seek an cause from an external impulse. At the same time these two effects of lust ought to be noticed — that it ensnares us by its allurements, and that it does us away; each of which 				is sufficient to render us guilty.   				 <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p30"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p30.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p31"></a><b>15</b> <i>Then when lust hath conceived</i>. He first calls that <i>lust</i> which is not any kind of evil affection or desire, but that which is the fountain of all evil affections; by which, as he shews, are conceived vicious broods, which at length break forth into 				sins. It seems, however, improper, and not according to the usage of Scripture, to restrict the word <i>sin</i> to outward works, as though indeed lust itself were not a sin, and as though corrupt desires, remaining closed up within and suppressed, were not so many sins. But as the use of a word is various, there is nothing unreasonable if it be taken here, as in many other places, for actual sin.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p32"></a>And the Papists ignorantly lay hold on this passage, and seek to prove from it that vicious, yea, filthy, wicked, and the most abominable lusts are not sins, provided there is no assent; for James does not shew when sin begins to be born, so as to be sin, and so accounted by God, but when it breaks forth. For he proceeds gradually and shews that the consummation of sin is eternal death, and that sin arises from depraved desires, and that 				these depraved desires or affections have their root in lust. It hence follows that men gather fruit in eternal perdition, and fruit which they have procured for themselves.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p33"></a>By <i>perfected sin</i>, therefore, I understand, not any one act of sin perpetrated, but the completed course of sinning. For though death is merited by every sin whatever, yet it is said to be the reward of an ungodly and wicked life. Hence is the dotage of those confuted who conclude from these words, that sin is not mortal until it 				breaks forth, as they say, into an external act. Nor is this what James treats of; but his object was only this, to teach that there is in us the root of our own destruction.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.v"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p10"></a><b>16</b>  <i>Do not err</i>. This is an argument from what is opposite; for as God is the author of all good, it is absurd to suppose him to be the author of evil. To do good is what properly belongs to him, and according to his nature; and from him all good things come to us. Then, whatever 				evil he does, is not agreeable to his nature. But as it sometimes happens, that he who quits himself well through life, yet in some things fails, he meets this doubt by denying that God is mutable like men. But if God is in all things and always like himself, it hence follows that well-doing is his perpetual work.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p12"></a>This reasoning is far different from that of Plato, who maintained that no calamities are sent on men by God, because he is good; for though it is just that the crimes of men should be punished by God, yet it is not right, with regard to him, to regard among evils that punishment which he justly inflicts. Plato, indeed, was ignorant; but James, leaving to God his right and office of punishing, only removes blame from him. This passage 				teaches us, that we ought to be so affected by God’s innumerable blessings, which we daily receive from his hand, as to think of nothing but of his glory; and that we should abhor whatever comes to our mind, or is suggested by others, which is not compatible with his praise.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p13"></a>God is called the <i>Father of lights</i>, as possessing all excellency and the highest dignity. And when he immediately adds, that there is in him <i>no shadow of turning</i>, he continues the metaphor; so that we may not measure the brightness of God by 				the irradiation of the sun which appears to us.   				 <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p16"></a><b>18</b> <i>Of his own will</i>. He now brings forward a special proof of the goodness of God which he had mentioned, even that he has regenerated us unto eternal life. This invaluable benefit every one of the faithful feels in himself. Then the goodness of God, when known by experience, ought to remove from them all a 				contrary opinion respecting him.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p17"></a>When he says that God <i>of his own will</i>, or spontaneously, <i>hath begotten us</i>, he intimates that he was induced by no other reason, as the will and counsel of God are often set in opposition to the merits of men. What great thing, indeed, would it have been to say that God was not constrained to do this? But he impresses something more, that God according to his own goodwill hath begotten us, and has been thus a cause to himself. 				It hence follows that it is natural to God to do good.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p18"></a>But this passage teaches us, that as our election before the foundation of the world was gratuitous, so we are illuminated by the grace of God alone as to the knowledge of the truth, so that our calling corresponds with our election. The Scripture shews that we have been gratuitously adopted by God before we were born. But James expresses here something more, that we obtain the right of adoption, because God does also call us gratuitously. 				(<a name="vi.ii.v-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph. 1:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">5</a><a name="vi.ii.v-p18.1"></a>.) Farther, we hence learn, that it is the peculiar office of God spiritually to regenerate us; for that the same thing is sometimes ascribed to the ministers of the gospel, means no other thing than this, that God acts through them; and it happens indeed through them, but he nevertheless alone doeth the work.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p19"></a>The word <i>begotten</i> means that we become new men, so that we put off our former nature when we are effectually called by God. He adds how God begets us, even by <i>the word of truth</i>, so that we may know that we cannot enter the kingdom of God by any other door.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p20"></a><i>That we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures</i>. The word <a name="vi.ii.v-p20.1"></a>τινὰ, “some,” has the meaning of likeness, as though he had said, that we are in a manner firstfruits. But this ought not to be restricted to a few of the faithful; but it belongs to all in 				common. For as man excels among all creatures, so the Lord elects some from the whole mass and separates them as a holy offering, to himself.   				 <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a>
  				 It is no common nobility into which God extols his own children. Then justly are they said to be excellent as firstfruits, when God’s image is renewed in them.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.vi"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p10"></a><b>19</b> <i> Let every man</i>. Were this a general sentence, the inference would be farfetched; but as he immediately adds a sentence respecting the word of truth suitable to the last verse, I doubt not but that he accommodates this exhortation peculiarly to the subject in hand. Having then set before us the goodness 				of God, he shews how it becomes us to be prepared to receive the blessing which he exhibits towards us. And this doctrine is very useful, for spiritual generation is not a work of one moment. Since some remnants of the old man ever abide in us, we must necessarily be through life renewed, until the flesh be abolished; for either our perverseness, or arrogance, or sloth, is a great impediment to God in perfecting in us his work. Hence, when James would have us to be <i>swift to hear</i>, he commends promptitude, as though he had said, “When God so freely and kindly presents himself to you, you also ought to render yourselves teachable, lest your slowness should cause him to desist from speaking.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p11"></a>But inasmuch as we do not calmly hear God speaking to us, when we seem to ourselves to be very wise, but by our haste interrupt him when addressing us, the Apostle requires us to be silent, to be <i>slow to speak</i>. And, doubtless, no one can be a true disciple of God, except he hears him in silence. He does not, however, require the 				silence of the Pythagorean school, so that it should not be right to inquire whenever we desire to learn what is necessary to be known; but he would only have us to correct and restrain our forwardness, that we may not, as it commonly happens, unseasonably interrupt God, and that as long as he opens his sacred mouth, we may open to him our hearts and our ears, and not prevent him to speak.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p12"></a><i>Slow to wrath</i>. Wrath also, I think, is condemned with regard to the hearing which God demands to be given to him, as though making a tumult it disturbed and impeded him, for God cannot be heard except when the mind is calm and sedate. Hence, he adds, that as long as wrath bears rule there is no place for the righteousness of God. In short, except the 				heat of contention be banished, we shall never observe towards God that calm silence of which he has just spoken.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.vi-p13"></a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p13.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p14"></a><b>21</b> <i>Wherefore lay apart</i>. He concludes by saying how the word of life is to be received. And first, indeed, he intimates that it cannot be rightly received except it be implanted, or strike roots in us. For the expression, <i>to receive the implanted word</i>, 				ought to be thus explained, “to receive it, that it may be really implanted.” For he alludes to seed often sown on and ground, and not received into the moist bosom of the earth; or to plants, which being cast on the ground, or laid on dead wood, soon wither. He then requires that it should be a living implanting, by which the word becomes as it were united with our heart.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p15"></a>He at the same time shews the way and manner of this reception, even <i>with meekness</i>. By this word he means humility and the readiness of a mind disposed to learn, such as Isaiah describes when he says,</p>  			 
 <p class="Center"><a name="vi.ii.vi-p16"></a>“On whom does my Spirit rest, except on the humble and meek?” (<a name="vi.ii.vi-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015">Isa 57:15</a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p16.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p17"></a>Hence it is, that so far profit in the school of God, because hardly one in a hundred renounces the stubbornness of his own spirit, and gently submits to God; but almost all are conceited and refractory. But if we desire to be the living plantation of God, we must subdue our proud hearts and be humble, and labor to become like lambs, so as to suffer ourselves to be ruled and guided by our Shepherd.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p18"></a>But as men are never thus tamed, so as to have a calm and meek heart, except they are purged from depraved affections, so he bids us to <i>lay aside uncleanness and redundancy of wickedness</i>. And as James borrowed a comparison from agriculture, it was necessary for him to observe this order, to begin by rooting up noxious weeds. And 				since he addressed all, we may hence conclude that these are the innate evils of our nature, and that they cleave to us all; yea, since he addresses the faithful, he shews that we are never wholly cleansed from them in this life, but that they are continually sprouting up, and therefore he requires that care should be constantly taken to eradicate them. As the word of God is especially a holy thing; to be fitted to receive it, we must put off the filthy things by which we have been 				polluted.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p19"></a>Under the word <a name="vi.ii.vi-p19.1"></a>κακία, he comprehends hypocrisy and obstinacy as well as unlawful desires or lusts. Not satisfied with specifying the seat of wickedness as being in the soul of man, he teaches us that so abounding is the wickedness that dwells there, that it overflows, or 				that it rises up as it were into a heap; and doubtless, whosoever will well examine himself will find that there is within him an immense chaos of evils.   				 <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">109</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p22"></a><i>Which is able to save</i>. It is a high eulogy on heavenly truth, that we obtain through it a sure salvation; and this is added, that we may learn to seek and love and magnify the word as a treasure that is incomparable. It is then a sharp goad to chastise our idleness, when he says that the word which we are wont to hear so negligently, is the means of our 				salvation, though for this purpose the power of saving is not ascribed to the word, as if salvation is conveyed by the external sound of the word, or as if the office of saving is taken away from God and transferred elsewhere; for James speaks of the word which by faith penetrates into the hearts of men, and only intimates that God, the author of salvation, conveys it by his Gospel.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p21"></a><b>23</b> <i>He is like to a man</i>. Heavenly doctrine is indeed a mirror in which God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed unto his image, as Paul says in <a name="vi.ii.vii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018">2Co 3:18</a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p21.1"></a>. But here he speaks of the external glance of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates into the heart. It is a striking comparison, by which he briefly intimates, that a doctrine merely heard and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it soon vanishes away.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.vii-p22"></a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p22.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p23"></a><b>25</b> <i>The perfect law of liberty</i>. After having spoken of empty speculation, he comes now to that penetrating intuition which transforms us to the image of God. And as he had to do with the Jews, he takes the word <i>law</i>, familiarly known to them, as including 				the whole truth of God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p24"></a>But why he calls it <i>a perfect law</i>, and <i>a law of liberty</i>, interpreters have not been able to understand; for they have not perceived that there is here a contrast, which may be gathered from other passages of Scripture. As long as the law is preached by the external voice of man, and not inscribed by the finger and Spirit of God on the heart, it is but a dead letter, and as it were a lifeless thing. It is, then, no wonder 				that the law is deemed imperfect, and that it is the law of bondage; for as Paul teaches in <a name="vi.ii.vii-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024">Ga 4:24</a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p24.1"></a>, separated from Christ, it generates to condemn and as the same shews to us in <a name="vi.ii.vii-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013">Ro 8:13</a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p24.2"></a>, it can do nothing but fill us with diffidence and fear. But the Spirit of regeneration, who inscribes it on our inward parts, 				brings also the grace of adoption. It is, then, the same as though James had said, “The teaching of the law, let it no longer lead you to bondage, but, on the contrary, bring you to liberty; let it no longer be only a schoolmaster, but bring you to perfection: it ought to be received by you with sincere affection, so that you may lead a godly and a holy life.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p25"></a>Moreover, since it is a blessing of the Old Testament that the law of God should reform us, as it appears from <a name="vi.ii.vii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p25.1"></a>, and other passages, it follows that it cannot be obtained until we come to Christ. And, doubtless, he alone is the end and perfection of the law; and James adds <i>liberty</i>, as an inseparable associate, because the 				Spirit of Christ never regenerates but that he becomes also a witness and an earnest of our divine adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and trembling.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p26"></a><i>And continueth</i>. This is firmly to persevere in the knowledge of God; and when he adds, <i>this man shall be blessed in his deed</i>, or work, he means that blessedness is to be found in doing, not in cold hearing.  				 <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">111</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p29"></a><b>26</b> <i>Seem to be religious</i>. He now reproves even in those who boasted that they were doers of the law, a vice under which hypocrites commonly labor, that is, the wantonness of the tongue in detraction. He has before touched on the duty of restraining the tongue, but for a different end; for he then bade 				silence before God, that we might be more fitted to learn. He speaks now of another thing, that the faithful should not employ their tongue in evil speaking.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p30"></a>It was indeed needful that this vice should be condemned, when the subject was the keeping of the law; for they who have put off the grosser vices, are especially subject to this disease. He who is neither an adulterer, nor a thief, nor a drunkard, but, on the contrary, seems brilliant with some outward shew of sanctity will set himself off by defaming others, and this under the pretense of zeal, but really through the lust of 				slandering.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p31"></a>The object here, then, was to distinguish between the true worshippers of God and hypocrites, who are so swollen with Pharisaic pride, that they seek praise from the defects of others. <i>If any one,</i> he says, <i>seems to be religious,</i> that is, who has a show of sanctity, and the meantime flatters himself by speaking evil of others, it is hence evident that he does not truly serve God. For by saying that his religion is vain, he 				not only intimates that other virtues are marred by the stain of evil-speaking, but that the conclusion is, that the zeal for religion which appears is not sincere.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p32"></a><i>But deceiveth his own heart</i>. I do not approve of the version of Erasmus — “But suffers his heart to err;” for he points out the fountain of that arrogance to which hypocrites are addicted, through which, being blinded by an immoderate love of themselves, they believe themselves to be far better than they really are; and hence, no doubt, is the disease 				of slandering, because the wallet, as Aesop says in his Apologue, hanging behind, is not seen. Rightly, then, has James, wishing to remove the effect, that is, the lust of evil-speaking, added the cause, even that hypocrites flatter themselves immoderately. For they would be ready to forgive were they in their turn to acknowledge themselves to be in need of forgiveness. Hence the flatteries by which they deceive themselves as to their own vices, make them such supercilious censors of 				others.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.ii.vii-p33"></a><a name="vi.ii.vii-p33.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p34"></a><b>27</b> <i>Pure religion</i>. As he passes by those things which are of the greatest moment in religion, he does not define generally what religion is, but reminds us that religion without the things he mentions is nothing; as when one given to wine and gluttony boasts that he is temperate, and another should 				object, and say that the temperate man is he who does not indulge in excess as to wine or eating; his object is not to express the whole of what temperance is, but to refer only to one thing, suitable to the subject in hand. For they are in vain religious of whom he speaks, as they are for the most part trifling pretenders.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p35"></a>James then teaches us that religion is not to be estimated by the pomp of ceremonies; but that there are important duties to which the servants of God ought to attend.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p36"></a>To <i>visit in necessity</i> is to extend a helping hand to alleviate such as are in distress. And as there are many others whom the Lord bids us to succor, in mentioning widows and orphans, he states a part for the whole. There is then no doubt but that under one particular thing he recommends to us every act of love, as though he had said, “Let him who would be deemed religious, prove himself to be such by self denial and by mercy and 				benevolence towards his neighbors.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p37"></a>And he says, <i>before God</i>, to intimate that it appears in deed otherwise to men, who are led astray by external masks, but that we ought to seek what pleases him. By <i>God and Father</i>, we are to understand God who is a father.</p>

As this epistle was written in Greek, it was no doubt intended more especially for those of the latter dispersion. But the benefit of the eastern dispersion was soon consulted, as the very <i>first</i> version of the New 					 Testament was made into this language, that is, the Syriac; and this was done at the beginning of the second century.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="vi.ii.v-p14"></a> This verse must be taken in connection with what as gone before. When he mentions “every good gift,” it is in opposition to the evil of which he says God is not the author. See <a name="vi.ii.v-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011">Mt 7:11</a><a name="vi.ii.v-p14.1"></a>. And “every perfect free-gift,” as <a name="vi.ii.v-p14.2"></a>δώρημα means, has a reference to the correction of the evil which arises from man himself. And he calls free-gift perfect, because it has no mixture of evil, what he throughout denies that God is the author of. Then the latter part of the verse bears a correspondence with the first. He calls God “the Father of Lights.” Light in the language of scripture means especially two things, the light of truth, divine knowledge and holiness. God is the father, the parent, the origin, the source of 					 these lights. Hence from him descends every good, useful, necessary gift, to deliver men from evil, from ignorance and delusion, and every perfect free-gift to free men from their evil lusts, and to render them holy and happy. And to shew that God is ever the same, he adds, “with whom there is no variableness or the shadow (or shade, of the slightest appearance) of a change;” that is, who never varies in his dealings with men, and shews no symptom of any change, being the author and giver of 					 all good, and the author of no evil, that is, of no sin.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="vi.ii.vi-p20"></a> What renders this passage unsatisfactory is the meaning given to <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.1"></a>περισσεία, rendered by some “superfluity,” and by others “redundancy.” The verb <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.2"></a>περισσεύω means not only to abound, but also to be a residue, to remain, to be a 					 remnant. See <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020">Mt 14:20</a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.3"></a>; <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#017">Lu 9:17</a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.4"></a>.

Let it have this meaning here, and the sense will not only be clear, but very striking. James was addressing those who were Christians; and he exhorted them to throw away every uncleanness and remnant of wickedness, or evil, as the word <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.9"></a>κακία more properly means. See <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.10"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022">Ac 8:22</a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.10"></a>; <a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.11"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016">1Pe 2:16</a><a name="vi.ii.vi-p20.11"></a></p>  				  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.vi-p21"></a>“Every uncleanness,” or filthiness, means every kind of uncleanness arising from lustful and carnal indulgences; and the “remnant of wickedness,” in thought and in deed, most suitably follows.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="vi.ii.vii-p27"></a> It may be rendered thus, — “The same shall be blessed in (or by) the doing of it,” that is, the work. The very doing of the law of liberty, of what the gospel prescribes, makes a man blessed or happy.</p>
