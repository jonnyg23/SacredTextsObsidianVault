 <p><a name="ix.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> And when it came to pass that we had loosed, being pulled away from them, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the next day to the Rhodes, and thence to Patara; <b>2.</b> And when we had gotten a ship, which sailed over to Phenicia, when we were entered into it, we launched. <b>3.</b> And when Cyprus began to appear to us, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed into Syria, and came to Tyrus: for here the ship did unlade her 				  burden. <b>4.</b> And when we had found disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul by the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. <b>5.</b> And when the days were ended, we departed and went our way; and they all, with their wives and children, accompanied us, until we were out of the city; and when we had kneeled down upon the shore, we prayed. <b>6.</b> And when we had taken our leave one of another, we went up into the ship; and they returned home.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.i-p5"></a><b>1.</b> Luke reckoneth up briefly the course of his sailing; and that not only to win credit to the history, that we may know what was done in every place, but that the readers may weigh with themselves the invincible and heroic fortitude which was in Paul, who would rather be tossed and troubled with such long, unlevel,  			  <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">452</font></a>
  			 and troublesome journeys, that he might serve Christ, than provide for his own quietness. Whereas he saith that they were drawn and pulled away, it is not simply referred unto the distance of places; but because the brethren stood on the shore, so long as they could see the ship wherein Paul and his companions were carried. He nameth the havens where the ship arrived,  			  <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">453</font></a>
  			 for this cause that we may know that they sailed quietly without trouble of tempest. Let us search the describers of countries  			  <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">454</font></a>
  			 touching the situation of the cities whereof he maketh mention; it is sufficient for me to show Luke’s purpose.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p9"></a><a name="ix.i-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p10"></a><b>4.</b><i> And when they had found disciples.</i> Though the number of the faithful was but small, yet there came some seed of the gospel thither, according to the prophecies Of the prophets, (<a name="ix.i-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018">Isa 23:18</a><a name="ix.i-p10.1"></a>) lest Tyrus 			 should be altogether void of the blessing of God. And here, as in other places going before, Luke calleth Christians disciples, that we may know that those alone are numbered in the flock of Christ who have embraced his doctrine by faith. For that is a vain   			  <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">455</font></a>
  			  and false profession for a man to give his name to Christ, and not to understand what he teacheth or speaketh. And let the readers mark, that Paul stayed seven days at Tyrus, for no other cause, saving that he might strengthen them. So that we see, that whithersoever he came he foreslowed [neglected] no occasion to do good.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p12"></a><i>They said by the Spirit.</i> Namely, with the approbation of speech, that Paul might know that they spake by the Spirit of prophecy. Surely this was no small temptation to cause him not to finish the journey which he had taken in hand, seeing the Holy Ghost did dissuade him from the same. And this was a very fair color   			  <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">456</font></a>
  			  to fly from the cross, if he had cared for his own safety, to be drawn back as it were with the hand of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p14"></a>Notwithstanding, he ceaseth not to hold on thither whither he knew he was called by the Lord. Notwithstanding, here ariseth a question, how the brethren can dissuade him by the Spirit from doing that which Paul did testify he doth by the secret motion of the same Spirit? Is the Spirit contrary to himself, that he doth now loose Paul whom he held bound inwardly? I answer, that there be diverse gifts of the Spirit; so that it is no marvel if 			 those who excel in the gift of prophecy be sometimes destitute of judgment or strength.  			  <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">457</font></a>
  			 The Lord showed to these brethren, of whom Luke maketh mention, what should come to pass; yet, nevertheless, they know not what is expedient, and what Paul’s calling doth require, because the measure of their gift doth not reach so far. And the Lord would have his servant admonished of purpose, partly, that through long meditation, he might be better furnished and prepared to suffer whatsoever should come, partly that his constancy might more plainly appear, when as being certified by 			 prophecies of the doleful event, he doth, notwithstanding, wittingly and willingly, make haste to endure whatsoever things shall befall him.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.i-p17"></a><b>5.</b><i> With their wives and children. </i>This was no small testimony of love, in that they accompanied Paul out of the city with their wives and children, which thing Luke doth report, partly that he might commend their godliness according as it deserved; partly that he might declare that Paul had that honor given him which was due to him. Whence 			 we do also gather, that he meant nothing less than to provide for his own commodity, seeing that he was not kept back with so great good will, which was a pleasant bait to entice him to stay. And we must also note the solemn custom of praying in weightier affairs, and that being certified by God of the danger, they are more stirred up to pray.</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption06"><a name="ix.ii-p1"></a><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007">Acts 21:7-14</a><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p2"></a><b>7.</b> And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came down to Ptolemais, and after that we had saluted the brethren, we abode with them one day. <b>8.</b> And on the morrow, we which were with Paul departed, and came to Cesarea; and, entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven, we abode with him. <b>9.</b> And this man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. <b>10.</b> And when we abode many 				  days, there came a certain prophet from Judea, named Agabus. <b>11.</b> When he was come to us, he took, Paul’s girdle, and, binding his own feet and hands, he said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, The man which owneth this girdle shall the Jews thus bind at Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. <b>12.</b> And when we had heard these things, both we, and also the rest which were of that place, requested him that he would not go up to Jerusalem. <b>13.</b> Then Paul 				  answered and said, What do you, weeping and afflicting my heart? I truly am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus. <b>14.</b> And when he would not be persuaded, we were quiet, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p3"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p4"></a><a name="ix.ii-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p5"></a><b>7.</b> Luke doth briefly declare that Paul was also received at Ptolemais by the brethren. This is a city of Phenicia, standing upon the sea-coast, not far from the borders of Judea, from which Paul and his companions had no long journey to Cesarea. But if the readers be disposed to know farther touching the situation of regions, let them resort unto the describers of places and countries [geographers]. Furthermore, he saith, that when he 			 came to Cesarea, they lodged with Philip, whom he calleth an Evangelist, though he were one of the seven deacons, as we may see in the sixth chapter (<a name="ix.ii-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005">Ac 6:5</a><a name="ix.ii-p5.1"></a>). By this we may easily gather, that that deaconship was an office which continued but for a time;  			  <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">458</font></a>
  			 because it had not otherwise been lawful for Philip to forsake Jerusalem, and to go to Cesarea. And in this place he is set before us, not as a voluntary forsaker of his office, but as one to whom a greater and more excellent charge was committed. The evangelists, in my judgment, were in the midst between apostles and doctors. For it was a function next to the apostles to preach the gospel in all places, and not to have any certain place of abode;  			  <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">459</font></a>
  			 only the degree of honor was inferior. For when Paul describeth the order of the Church, (<a name="ix.ii-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph 4:11</a><a name="ix.ii-p7.2"></a>) he doth so put them after the apostles, that he showeth that they have more room given them where they may teach than the pastors, who are tied to certain places. Therefore, Philip did for a time exercise the office of a deacon at Jerusalem, whom the Church thought afterward to be a meet man to 			 whom the treasure of the gospel should be committed.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p8"></a><a name="ix.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p9"></a><b>9.</b><i> Four daughters.</i> This is added for the commendation of Philip, not only that we might know that his house was well ordered, but also that it was famous and excellent through the blessing of God. For, assuredly, it was no small gift to have four daughters all endowed with the spirit of prophecy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p10"></a>By this means the Lord meant to beautify the first beginnings of the gospel, when he raised up men and women to foretell things to come. Prophecies had now almost ceased many years among the Jews, to the end they might be more attentive and desirous to hear the new voice of the gospel. Therefore, seeing that prophesying, which was in a manner quite ceased, doth now after long time return again, it was a token of a more perfect state. 			 Notwithstanding, it seemeth that the same was the reason why it ceased shortly after; for God did support the old people with diverse foretellings, until Christ should make an end of all prophecies.  			  <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">460</font></a>
  			 Therefore, it was meet that the new kingdom of Christ should be thus furnished and beautified with this furniture, that all men might know that that promised visitation of the Lord was present; and it was also expedient that it should last but for a short time, lest the faithful should always wait for some farther thing, or lest that curious wits might have occasion given to seek or invent some new thing ever now and then. For we know that when that ability and skill was taken away, 			 there were, notwithstanding, many brain-sick fellows, who did boast that they were prophets; and also it may be that the frowardness of men did deprive the Church of this gift. But that one cause ought to be sufficient, in that God, by taking away prophecies, did testify that the end and perfection was present in Christ; and it is uncertain how these maids did execute the office of prophesying, saving that the Spirit of God did so guide and govern them, that he did not overthrow the order which 			 he himself set down. And forasmuch as he doth not suffer women to bear any public office in the Church, it is to be thought that they did prophesy at home, or in some private place, without the common assembly.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p12"></a><a name="ix.ii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p13"></a><b>10.</b> <i>A certain prophet.</i> Though Luke doth not plainly express the same, yet do I conjecture that this Agabus was the same of whom mention is made in the eleventh chapter, (<a name="ix.ii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Ac 11:28</a><a name="ix.ii-p13.1"></a>) 			 who foretold that there should be famine under the reign of Claudius Caesar. And when as Luke calleth him a prophet, as of late he called, the four daughters of Philip, he signifieth that it was not a common but a peculiar gift. Now, we must see to what end the persecution which was at hand was now again showed by Agabus. As concerning Paul, he was sufficiently told already.   			  <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">461</font></a>
  			  Therefore, I do not doubt but that this confirmation was added for other men’s sake; because the Lord meant every where to make known the bonds of his servant, partly that they might know that he entered the combat willingly, partly that they might perceive that he was appointed of God to be a champion to fight for the gospel. It was surely a profitable example of invincible constancy, seeing that he offered himself willingly and wittingly to the violence of the 			 adversaries; and no less profitable is it for us at this day, that his apostleship should be confirmed with this voluntary and no less constant giving over of his life.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p15"></a><i>The man who owneth this girdle.</i> It was an usual thing among the prophets to represent those things which they spake by signs; neither did they confirm their prophecies by using signs, through their own motion, but at the commandment of the Spirit, as when Isaias is commanded to go barefoot, (<a name="ix.ii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002">Isa 20:2</a><a name="ix.ii-p15.1"></a>) Jeremiah to put a yoke upon his neck, to sell the possession and to buy it, (<a name="ix.ii-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002">Jer 27:2</a><a name="ix.ii-p15.2"></a>, and <a name="ix.ii-p15.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007">Jer 32:7</a><a name="ix.ii-p15.3"></a>) and Ezekiel to dig through the wall of his house privily, and in the same night to 			 carry forth burthens, (<a name="ix.ii-p15.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005">Eze 12:5</a><a name="ix.ii-p15.4"></a>). These and such like might seem to the common sort to be toys;   			  <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">462</font></a>
  			  but the same Spirit, who did apply signs to his words, did inwardly touch the hearts of the godly, as if they had been brought to the very thing itself. So this spectacle, mentioned by Luke, did no less move Paul’s companions, than if they had seen him bound in deed. The false prophets did afterward essay to delude the simple by this policy, as Satan is in a manner God’s ape, and his ministers do envy the servants of God. Zedekias made himself horns, wherewith he 			 promised Syria should be pushed. Ananias, by breaking Jeremiah’s yoke, put the people in a vain hope of deliverance. God hath suffered the reprobate to be deluded with such delusions, that he might punish their unbelief.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></a>But, forasmuch as there was in them no force of the Spirit, their vanity did no whit hurt the faithful. This is also worthy to be noted, that Agabus doth not set before their eyes a dumb spectacle, but he coupleth therewith the word, whereby he may show to the faithful the use and end of the ceremony.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p18"></a><a name="ix.ii-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p19"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Both we.</i> Because they had not all one revelation, it is no marvel if their judgments were diverse. For seeing these holy men knew that there consisted much in the life or death of one man, they would not have him to come in danger rashly. And their desire is worthy [of] praise, in 			 that they desired to provide for the common safety of the Church by keeping back Paul. But, on the other side, Paul’s constancy deserveth so much the more praise, when as he continueth so steadfast   			  <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">463</font></a>
  			  in the calling of God. For he was not ignorant what great trouble he should suffer by reason of his bands. But because he knoweth the will of God, which was his only rule in taking counsel, he maketh no account of all other things, that he may follow it. And, assuredly, we must be so subject to the will and pleasure of God, that no profit, no kind of reason may remove us from obeying him.   			  <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">464</font></a>
  			  When Paul doth reprehend the brethren, because they afflict his heart with weeping, he doth sufficiently declare that he was not hardened,   			  <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">465</font></a>
  			  but that he was brought unto some feeling and suffering together with them.   			  <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">466</font></a>
  			  Therefore, the tears of the godly did wound his heart; but that softness did not turn him out of the way, but that he proceeded to follow God with a straight course. Therefore, we must use such courtesy toward our brethren, that the beck or will of God have always the upper hand. Now Paul doth again declare by his answer, that the servants of Christ cannot be prepared to do their duty, unless they despise death; and that none can ever be well encouraged to live to 			 the Lord, but those who will willingly lay down their lives for the testimony of the truth.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p24"></a><a name="ix.ii-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p25"></a><b>14.</b> <i>We ceased saying.</i> If they had thought that he ran rashly unto death, they would not have ceased so. Therefore, they yield lest they resist the Holy Spirit, whereby they understand that Paul is governed. For that which they had heard before, by the mouth of Paul, that he was drawn, as 			 it were, by the bands of the Spirit, was quite out of their heads by reason of the sorrow which they had conceived; but when they be taught again that it was the will of God that it should be so, they think it unlawful for them to resist any longer. And with this bridle must all our affections be kept in, that nothing be so bitter, or doleful, or hard, which the will of God may not mitigate and mollify. For so often as any thing which is hard or sharp doth fall out, we give God small honor, 			 unless this cogitation prevail with us, that we must obey him.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption06"><a name="ix.iii-p1"></a><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015">Acts 21:15-25</a><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p2"></a><b>15.</b> And after these days, having taken up our burdens, we went up to Jerusalem. <b>16.</b> And there came together with us certain of the disciples from Cesarea, bringing with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. <b>17.</b> And when we were come unto Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. <b>18.</b> And on the morrow Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. <b>19.</b> Whom 				  after we had saluted, he told by order all things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry. <b>20.</b> But when they had heard, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousand Jews the be which believe; and they all are earnest followers of the law; <b>21.</b> And it hath been told them concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they must not circumcise their children, nor live 				  according to the customs. <b>22.</b> What is it then? The multitude must needs come together; for they shall hear that thou art come. <b>23.</b> Therefore, do this which we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow upon them; <b>24.</b> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and do cost on them, that they may shave their heads, and that all men may know that those things which they have heard concerning thee are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest and keepest the law. <b>25.</b> 				  And as concerning those which among the Gentiles have believed, we have written, decreeing that they observe no such thing, but that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.iii-p5"></a><b>15.</b><i> When we had taken up our burdens.</i> Paul’s companions declare, that when they went about to call back Paul from danger, they did rather care for the common safety of the Church, than every man for his own life. For after they had taken the repulse, they do not refuse to take part with him in the same danger; 			 and yet this was a plausible excuse that they were bound by no law to be hauled to suffer death, through one man’s stubbornness. And this is truly to bring our affections in subjection to God, when we are terrified with no fear, but every one of us endeavoreth, so much as he is able, to further that which we know doth please him. Also, it appeareth more plainly what great ferventness of godliness was in the rest, who of their own accord accompany him, and bring him an host; whereas, 			 notwithstanding, they might well have feared many discommodities.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p6"></a><a name="ix.iii-p6.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p7"></a><b>17.</b> <i>They received us gladly.</i> Luke reciteth this, therefore, that he may set forth the equity of the brethren, who did not credit rumors   			  <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">467</font></a>
  			  and false reports. Though many envious and wicked men did daily, one after another, endeavor to bring Paul in contempt, yet, because James and his fellows in office were well persuaded of his uprightness, they were not estranged from him. Therefore, they receive him now courteously and brotherly as a servant of Christ, and declare that he is welcome. This moderation must we observe diligently, that we be not too hasty to believe wicked reports, especially when those 			 who have given some testimony of their honesty, and whom we have tried   			  <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">468</font></a>
  			  to serve God faithfully, are burdened with crimes unknown to us, or else doubtful, because Satan knoweth that nothing is more fit to lay waste the kingdom of Christ, than discord and disagreement among the faithful, he ceaseth not to spread abroad false   			  <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">469</font></a>
  			  speeches, which may cause one to suspect another. Therefore, we must shut our ears against false reports, that we may believe nothing concerning the faithful ministers of the Word, but that which we know to be true.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.iii-p12"></a><b>18.</b><i> All the elders were present.</i> We may gather that out of this place which we had already in the fifteenth chapter. So often as any weighty business was to be handled, the elders were wont to come together, to the end the consultation might be more quiet without the multitude. We shall see anon, that the 			 people were likewise admitted in their order, yet after that the elders had had their secret consultation   			  <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">470</font></a>
  			  among themselves.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p14"></a><a name="ix.iii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p15"></a><b>19.</b> And now Paul showeth his modesty when he doth not make himself the author of those things which he had done, but giving the praise to God, doth call himself only the minister whose industry [agency] God had used. As we must grant, that whatsoever thing is excellent and worthy of praise, it is not done by our own power, but forasmuch as God doth work in us; and especially touching the edifying of the Church. Again, it appeareth how 			 far off the elders were from envy, when they glorify God for the joyful success. But because mention is made of no other apostle besides James, we may conjecture that they were gone into diverse places to spread abroad and preach the gospel as their calling did require; for the Lord had not appointed them to stay still at Jerusalem; but after they had made a beginning there, he commanded them to go into Judea and other parts of the world. Moreover, the error of those men, who think that James 			 was one of the disciples whom Paul numbereth among the three pillars of the Church, is refuted before in the fifteenth chapter. And though the same commandment was given to him which was given to the rest of his fellows in office; yet I do not doubt but that they did so divide themselves, that James stood still at Jerusalem, whither many strangers were wont daily to resort. For that was all one as if he had preached the gospel far and wide in strange  			  <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">471</font></a>
  			 places.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p17"></a><i>Thou seest, brother, how many thousands.</i> This oration or speech hath two members. For, first, the elders say, that so many of the Jews as were converted, seeing they be earnest followers of the law, are evil affected towards Paul, because they think that he endeavoreth, with might and main, to abolish the law. Secondly, they exhort him 			 that making a solemn vow he purge himself, that he may not be had in suspicion any longer. They object to Paul, the multitude of believers, that he may the more willingly yield to them. For if they had been a few stubborn fellows, he would not have been so much moved. But now he may not neglect both much people, and the whole body of the Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p18"></a>Undoubtedly, that zeal of the law, which was in them, was corrupt, and assuredly even the very elders declare sufficiently that they like it not. For though they do not condemn it openly, neither sharply complain of the same, yet because they separate themselves from their affection, they secretly confess that they err. If it had been a zeal according to knowledge, it ought to have begun at them; [selves] but they contend not for the law 			 itself, neither do they pretend the due reverence thereof, neither do they subscribe to those who are earnest followers of it. Therefore, they both signify that they are of another mind, and also that they do not allow [approve] the superstition of the people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p19"></a>Notwithstanding it is objected, that they say that Paul was burdened with a false report or slander; again, when they require at his hands satisfaction, they seem to nourish that zeal. I answer, that though that were a true report, in some respect, wherewith the Jews were offended, yet was it mixed with a slander. Paul did so teach the abrogating of the law, that notwithstanding by this means the authority thereof did not only continue sound 			 and perfect, but it was more holy. For as we said, in the seventh chapter, the ceremonies should be vain, unless the effect thereof had been showed in Christ. Therefore, those who say that they were abolished by the coming of Christ, are so far from being blasphemous against the law, that they rather confirm the truth thereof. We must consider two things in ceremonies; the truth, whereto is annexed the efficacy; secondly, the external use. Furthermore, the abrogating of the external use, which 			 Christ brought, dependeth hereupon, in that he is the sound body,  			  <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">472</font></a>
  			 and that nothing was shadowed in times past which is not fulfilled in him. This differeth much from the falling away from the law, to show the true  			  <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">473</font></a>
  			 end thereof, that the figures may have an end, and that the spiritual truth thereof may always be in force. Wherefore we see that they were malicious and unjust interpreters, who laid apostacy to Paul’s charge, though he did call away the faithful from the external worship of the law. And whereas they command Paul to make a vow to that end, that he may prove himself to be a keeper of the law, it tendeth to no other end, saving that he may testify that he doth not detest the law like a 			 wicked apostate, who did himself shake off the Lord’s yoke, and move others unto the like rebellion.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p22"></a><i>That they ought not to circumcise.</i> It was so indeed; for Paul taught that both Jews and Gentiles were set at liberty. For these sentences are general with him. Circumcision is nothing (<a name="ix.iii-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019">1Co 7:19</a><a name="ix.iii-p22.1"></a>). Again, We be 			 circumcised by baptism in Christ, not with circumcision made with hands; again, Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in the choice of feasts, which are shadows of things to come; but the body is in Christ (<a name="ix.iii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011">Col. 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016">16</a><a name="ix.iii-p22.2"></a>). Again, Whatsoever cometh into the shambles, and whatsoever is set before you, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake 			 (<a name="ix.iii-p22.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025">1Co 10:25</a><a name="ix.iii-p22.3"></a>). Again, Be not inwrapped again in the yoke of bondage (<a name="ix.iii-p22.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Ga 5:1</a><a name="ix.iii-p22.4"></a>). Seeing that he spake thus everywhere without exception, he freed the Jews from the necessity of keeping the law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p23"></a>And lest I stand too long upon this, one place shall be sufficient, where he compareth the law to a tutor, under which the old Church was, as in the childhood thereof; but now knowing the grace of Christ, it is grown up, that it may be free from ceremonies. In that place he speaketh undoubtedly both of the Jews and Gentiles. Also, when he saith that the hand-writing of the law, which did consist in decrees, (<a name="ix.iii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014">Col 2:14</a><a name="ix.iii-p23.1"></a>) is blotted out and nailed to the cross by Christ, he setteth free the Jews, as well as the Gentiles, from the ceremonies, which he calleth in that place decrees. But seeing that he did not precisely reject ceremonies, in teaching that the coming of Christ did make an end of the observing thereof, that was no revolting, as the envious Jews thought it to be.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p24"></a>Neither were the elders ignorant of Paul’s liberty. Therefore, seeing they understand the matter very well, their meaning is, to have this alone made known to the rude and unskillful, that Paul meant nothing less than to persuade the Jews to contemn the law. Therefore, they behold not the bare matter, but knowing what the common sort thought of Paul, by reason of the reports  			  <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">474</font></a>
  			 which went about concerning him, they seek to cure the same. Though I wot not whether this were more importunate than equal, [just] which they required at Paul’s hands. And by this it appeareth how preposterous the cruelty [credulity] of men is in receiving false reports, and how fast a false opinion, once rashly received, doth stick. It is certain that James and his fellows in office did endeavor to maintain and defend Paul’s good report, and to put away those lies which did hurt his 			 estimation; yet let them do what they can, they will speak evil of Paul. Unless, peradventure, they were too slack in the beginning, that they might gratify their countrymen, so that they were not their own men [free] afterward.</p>

  			  dependeth upon the circumstances which are hid from us at this day: yet they knew them well.

  			  because every man was wedded to his own custom, and would prescribe a law to others. Furthermore, they had at Jerusalem many things which might provoke them to keep the ceremonies of the law, so that they had a greater excuse if they did more slowly forsake them. And though their zeal were not void of fault, yet as it was an hard matter to reform it, so it could not be done at a sudden. We see how this superstition was scarce in long time pulled from the apostles; 			 and because new disciples came daily unto the faith, the infirmity was nourished in all together. And yet, notwithstanding, we must not deny but that ignorance was coupled with obstinacy, which the elders did nevertheless tolerate, lest they should do more hurt by using violent remedies.

 <p><a name="ix.iii-p34"></a><i>Having a vow upon them.</i> Though these four be reckoned among the faithful, yet their vow was superstitious. Whereby it appeareth that the apostles had much trouble in that nation, which was not only hardened in the worship of the law through long use, but was also naturally malapert, and almost intractable. Though it may be that these 			 men were as yet but novices, and therefore their faith was yet but slender, and scarce well framed; wherefore the doctors did suffer them to perform the vow which they had unadvisedly made. As touching Paul, because he made this vow not moved thereunto by his own conscience, but for their sakes, with whose error he did bear, the case stood otherwise with him. Notwithstanding, we must see whether this were one of the indifferent ceremonies, which the faithful might omit or keep at their 			 pleasure. It seemeth, indeed, to have in it certain things which did not agree   			  <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">479</font></a>
  			  with the profession of faith. But because the end thereof was thanksgiving, (as we said before in the eighteenth chapter) and there was nothing in the rite itself repugnant to the faith of Christ, Paul did not doubt to descend thus far to make his religion known. Therefore, Paul did that which he saith of himself elsewhere, because he made himself a companion of those which followed the law, as if he himself were in subjection to the law (<a name="ix.iii-p35.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020">1Co 9:20</a><a name="ix.iii-p35.2"></a>). Finally, he was made all things to all men, that he might win all; to wit, even unto the altars, so that he might pollute himself with no sacrilege under a color of love.   			  <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">480</font></a>
  			  It had not been so lawful for him to go unto the solemn sacrifice of satisfaction.   			  <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">481</font></a>
  			  But as for this part of the worship of God, which consisted in a vow, he might do it indifferently, so it were not done for religion’s sake, but only to support the weak. But it was neither his intent to worship God with this rite, neither was his conscience tied, but he did freely submit himself to his weak brethren.</p>

For the rumor rose not upon nothing, that he did call away the Jews from the ceremonies, and that he did not walk in observing the law. But we must remember that which I said even now, that it was sufficient for Paul and the 			 elders, if they could remove the slander which was unjustly raised, to wit, that he was a revolt [apostate] from the law, and there might a better opportunity be offered shortly, that in purging himself he might call them back by little and little from their error. Neither was it good or profitable that Paul should be counted an observer of the law any long time, as the disciples were then commonly; for by this means a thick   			  <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">482</font></a>

Therefore, it hath more color, and is (as they say) more disputable, that he was too easily entreated, and too ready to obey; and yet I do not admit that which some men say, that it went not well with Paul, because, taking upon him a new and unwonted person, he did not so constantly, as he was wont, 			 maintain the liberty purchased by Christ. I confess, indeed, that God doth oftentimes punish foolish purposes with unhappy success; but I see not why this should be applied to Paul, who through voluntary subjection sought to win the favor of the rude, and such as were not thoroughly instructed, that he might do them good; being about to do that not willingly, but because he had rather yield to the brethren than stick to his own judgment. Furthermore, when he was once admitted, he might fitly 			 have passed over to moderate that zeal. His courtesy doth rather deserve great praise, in that he doth not only gently abase himself for the unskillful people’s sake, but doth also obey  			  <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">484</font></a>

They boast that they do this to win the weak brethren, (or that they follow their vein thus far) as if Paul did yield to them in all things without choice. If, being Jews, they should take upon them according to the pre-script of the law, to fulfill among the Jews a 			 vow infected with no idolatry, then might they prove themselves to be like Paul.

 <p><a name="ix.v-p14"></a><b>37.</b><i> May I speak unto thee?</i> Paul offered himself to defend his cause, which all the servants of God must do. For we must do our endeavor to make our integrity known to all men, lest through our infamy the name of God be blasphemed. But when the chief captain demandeth whether Paul be not that Egyptian which was a 			 murderer, which a little before had led away a company of men,   			  <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">494</font></a>
  			  let us learn that how modestly and quietly soever the ministers of Christ behave themselves, and howsoever they be void of all fault, yet cannot they escape the reproaches and slanders of the world. Which thing we must note for this cause, that we may acquaint ourselves with rebukes;   			  <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">495</font></a>
  			  and that in well-doing we may be prepared to be evil-spoken of. When he asketh him concerning the Egyptian, he meaneth not Theudas the sorcerer, as some men falsely suppose; of whom Gamaliel made mention before in the fifth chapter, (<a name="ix.v-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036">Ac 5:36</a><a name="ix.v-p16.2"></a>) and of whom Josephus speaketh more in his twentieth of Antiquities. For, besides that we read there that Theudas carried 			 away only four hundred men, and the chief captain reckoneth up in this place four thousand, and saith that they were all murderers, that is more, in that Theudas raised that faction during the reign of Tiberius or Augustus Caesar; whereof remained only an obscure report, because, so soon as a troop of horsemen was sent after them, they were forthwith destroyed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p17"></a>Notwithstanding, it seemeth to me that Josephus is deceived in that where he saith, first, that Cuspius Fadus was sent by Claudius, and then he addeth, that Theudas was of him overcome, seeing I have before showed that that former insurrection was made at such time as Claudius was but a private man. Though he disagree much with Luke’s narration, even in the number, seeing he saith that there were about thirty thousand made partners in the 			 sedition, unless happily we expound it thus, that, after he was put to flight by Felix, he fled into the wilderness with four thousand. And it had been an absurd thing that the number should be made ten times greater, as also, that a troop, having no skill in war, or being altogether without courage, should have been defamed with the name of murderers. For as Josephus doth witness, that seducer had deceived the simple and credulous common people with false promises, boasting that he was a 			 prophet of God, which would lead the people dry foot through the midst of Jordan.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.v-p18"></a>But the same Josephus putteth the matter out of doubt when he saith, that an Egyptian, a prophet, did gather together a band of men under Felix the president, and did carry them into Mount Olivet, whereof four hundred were slain, two hundred taken, and the residue dispersed. The history was fresh in memory. Again, forasmuch as the author of the sedition was escaped, and the region filled with murderers,  			  <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">496</font></a>
  			 it is not without cause that the chief captain demandeth of Paul, when he seeth all men so hate him, whether he were that Egyptian. Luke recordeth no longer conference had between the chief captain and Paul; yet it is likely, forasmuch as both of them understood the Greek tongue, that they had farther talk. Whereby it came to pass, that so soon as Paul had well purged himself, he had license granted him to speak to the people. For the chief captain would never have suffered a wicked 			 man to make any public speech in a city which was so sore suspected.</p>
