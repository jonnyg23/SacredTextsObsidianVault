 <p><a name="xvii.i-p3"></a><b>1.</b> My heart is prepared, O God! my heart is prepared; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. <b>2.</b> Awake, psaltery and harp: I will arise at break of day. <b>3.</b> I will praise thee, O Jehovah! among the people; and sing unto thee among the nations: <b>4.</b> 				  Because thy goodness is great above the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. <b>5.</b> Be thou, O God! exalted above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth: <b>6.</b> That thy chosen may be set free, save me by thy right hand, and hear me. <b>7.</b> God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth. 				  <b>8.</b> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head: Judah is my lawgiver.   				   <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">292</font></a>
  				   <b>9.</b> Moab is the pot of my washing; over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistina I will triumph. <b>10.</b> Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will bring me even unto Edom? <b>11. </b>Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst repulsed us? and wentest not out, O God! with our armies? <b>12.</b> Lord us help out of our tribulations; because the help of man is vain. <b>13. </b>Through God we will do valiantly, and he shall trample under foot our enemies.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.i-p6"></a>Because this psalm is composed of parts taken from the fifty-seventh and sixtieth psalms, it would be superfluous to repeat, in this place, what we have already said by way of exposition in those psalms.  			  <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">293</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.i-p7"></a> “The 108th psalm is altogether made up of extracts from the others; its first part being identical (with the exceptions of a few slight variations) with the third division of the 57th; its second, with the second division of the 60th. And both these borrowed parts are discriminated, both in the 57th and 60th psalms, from the rest of the context by the word Selah. This is a remarkable fact, and illustrates strongly one of the functions of the 				  Diapsalma. These parts were, then, to a certain degree, regarded as distinct compositions, which occasionally were disjointed from their original context; the very change of sentiment and strain, which originated the word Diapsalma, sanctioning such an occasional practice.” — <i>Jebb</i>’<i>s</i> <i>Literal Version of the Book of Psalms, with Dissertations, </i>volume 2, page 109.</p>
