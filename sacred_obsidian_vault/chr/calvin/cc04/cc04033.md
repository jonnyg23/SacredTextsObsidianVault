 <p><a name="ii.x.viii-p4"></a><b>1.</b> Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="ii.x.viii-p5"></a><b>2.</b> Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <i>he be </i>of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <i>any </i>of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.x.viii-p7"></a><b>3.</b> And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.x.viii-p19"></a><b>1.</b> <i>And the Lord spake. </i>The prohibition of this superstition was previously expounded in its proper place. God here commands the punishment to be inflicted, if any one should have polluted himself with it. And surely it was a detestable sacrilege to enslave to idols that offspring, which was begotten to 				God, and which He had adopted in the loins of Abraham, since in this way they not only despoiled God of His right, but, so far as they could, blotted out the grace of adoption. What He had then generally pronounced, He now specially applies, viz., that they should be stoned who offered their seed to Molech; for otherwise they would have tried to escape on the pretense that they had no intention of revolting to other gods. Just as now-a-days, under the Papacy, whatever is alleged from Scripture 				against their impious and corrupt worship, is coldly and contemptuously received; because they varnish over their idolatries, and so indulge themselves in them in security. But after God has commanded His judges to punish this crime severely, He at the same time declares that, if perchance they should connive at it, and encourage it by their lenity, He Himself will avenge it, so as to punish much more heavily those who may have escaped from the hands of men; and not only so, but that He would 				implicate all those who might have been aware of it in the same con-detonation.</p>
