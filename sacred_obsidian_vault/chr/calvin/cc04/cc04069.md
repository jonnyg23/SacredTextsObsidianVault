 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p11"></a><b>1.</b> <i>And the Lord spake.</i> It is well known that in conjunction with the sacrifices there was an offering, which they call <i>minha, </i>but we shall elsewhere see that this was also used separately; for it was lawful without a victim to 				offer either plain meal, or cakes, or wafers seasoned with oil. Therefore, besides the sacrifice of consecration, of which Moses has already treated, this second offering is required from the priest, that he should present at his inauguration a cake fried in a pan, and cut in pieces. The reason of this appears to have been, that he might thence become the legitimate minister of all the people, and might duly offer in the name of others, when he had done what was right for himself. But a 				distinction is drawn between the demand upon the priest and that, upon the people, viz., that it should be “wholly burnt;” the reason for which, since it will be explained elsewhere, it will be now sufficient to advert to in a single word. The fact was that God was unwilling that the priests should indulge themselves in vain ostentation, which might have been easily the case, if the oblation had been preserved for their use, like the <i>minha </i>of 				the people which remained in their hands.</p>
