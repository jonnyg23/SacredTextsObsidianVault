  				  which are repugnant to the modesty of nature itself. In order that all impurity may be the more detestable, He enumerates two species of unnatural lust, from whence it is evident that when men indulge themselves in this respect, they are carried away by an impulse, which is more than beastly, to defile themselves by shameful wickedness. The beasts are satisfied with natural connection; it is therefore a gross enormity that this distinction should be confounded by man endowed with 				  reason; for what is the use of our judgment and intelligent faculties if it be not that greater self-restraint should exist in us than in the brute animals? It is plain, therefore, that they must be blinded in a horrible manner who so shamefully defile themselves, as Paul says. (<a name="ii.iii.iv.i-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028">Ro 1:28</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.i-p8.1"></a>.) The madness of lust has, however, invented several monstrous vices, whose names it would be better to bury, if God had 				  not chosen that these shameful monuments should exist, to inspire us with fear and horror. It has at length advanced to such excesses, that men created in God’s image, both male and female, have had connection with brutes.</p>

An old proverb   				   <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">62</font></a>
  				   says, that good laws have sprung from evil habits; and God reminds us that for this reason He has been induced expressly to advert to these disgusting and wicked things; for the monstrosities which He mentions would have been concealed in eternal silence had not necessity compelled Him to bring them to light. But since the Canaanitish nations had advanced to such a pitch of licentiousness, that the prodigious sins, which else would have been better concealed, 				  had been but too familiarly known from their wicked habits, God warns His people to beware of their fatal examples. First, when He says that these abominations prevailed amongst the Gentiles, He indicates that evil habits by no means avail as an excuse; nay, that public consent is in vain alleged in defense of vice. But the better to deter them from imitating them, He sets before their eyes the vengeance He is about to take. It is true, indeed, that the nations of Canaan were destroyed for 				  other reasons, but it is not without cause that He sets forth this amongst the rest, for undoubtedly God was offended by such pollutions.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.i-p13"></a><b>26. </b><i>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes</i>  He here contrasts His Law with the abominations of the Gentiles. The exhibition of His severity, which He had referred to, might indeed have sufficed for the instruction of His people; but in order to influence them more strongly, He at the same time 				  adduces the way pointed out to them in the Law, which would not suffer them to go astray, if only they refused not to follow God. For that the Gentiles, who were destitute of light, should have been drawn aside in every direction was not surprising; but whilst they thus proved their blindness, it behooved true believers, on the contrary, to testify that they were not children of darkness, but of light. And to this Paul seems to allude, when he exhorts believers not to walk, like the Gentiles, 				  “in the vanity of their mind.” (<a name="ii.iii.iv.i-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017">Eph 4:17</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.i-p13.1"></a>.) On this account God not only commends to them His precepts and statutes, but also His ordinances (<i>custodias</i>,) because He had omitted nothing in the Law which would be useful for the direction of men’s lives. The sum is, that unless they order themselves constantly by the doctrine 				  which enlightens them, the same destruction awaited them also which was about to overwhelm the (Canaanitish) nations.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.ii"></a>

  				   God had hitherto taught what was right, in order to restrain the people from sin, not only from fear of punishment, but for conscience’ sake. But whereas all do not voluntarily dispose themselves to obedience, the awards severe punishments to those wicked despisers in whom there is no effort to be religious. And it is astonishing that almost all the Gentiles have so sunk into stupid and brutal folly, that they have tolerated with little less than impunity 				  unnatural crimes, detestable in their very name.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.ii-p13"></a>I admit that even the wickedest of them were ashamed to justify so gross a crime; but although it was practiced with impunity, it was a common reproach to make even against the very public tribunals, that it ought to be more severely punished than other crimes, which they did not spare.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.ii-p14"></a>Both of the offending parties were subjected to the same punishment, because it is a pollution which ought by no means to be borne. Nay, if a man or woman offend with a beast, in order that, all may the more abhor and beware of the unnatural crime, the penalty is extended even to the harmless animal; as we have before seen that a goring ox is condemned to death if it had killed a man. Hence we infer how greatly displeasing to God is 				  this kind of crime, since its iniquity is confirmed by the death of guiltless animals.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.iii"></a>

It is a tame and forced interpretation to apply what is here said to spiritual fornication; and those also, who suppose that public stews only are forbidden, restrict the law too much, whereas God rather gives a general injunction that parents should preserve their daughters by means of a pure and chaste education.

A Political Supplement, whereby it appears how greatly God abominates adultery, since He denounces capital punishment against it. And assuredly, since marriage is a covenant consecrated by God, its profanation is in no wise tolerable; and conjugal faith should be held too sacred to be violated with impunity, whilst it is an act of horrible perfidiousness to snatch from a man’s bosom the wife who is as his very life, or at any rate half of himself. 				  Wherefore, also, the Prophet ignominiously compares adulterers to neighing horses, (<a name="ii.iii.iv.v-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008">Jer 5:8</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.v-p23.2"></a>;) for where such lasciviousness prevails, men degenerate, as it were, into beasts. Another reason is, however, here referred to; for, if a man had broken faith with his wife by having connection with a harlot, it was not a capital offense; but if any man, though a bachelor, had committed 				  adultery with the wife of another, (he was to die,   				   <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
  				   ) because both the husband is grossly injured, and the dishonor descends to the offspring, and all adulterine race is substituted in place of the legitimate one, whilst the inheritance is transferred to strangers, and thus bastards unlawfully possess themselves of the family name. This cause impelled the Gentiles, even before the Law, to punish adultery with severity, as clearly appears from the history of Judah and Tamar. 				  (<a name="ii.iii.iv.v-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014">Ge 38:14</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.v-p24.1"></a>.) Nay, by the universal law of the Gentiles, the punishment of death was always awarded to adultery; wherefore it is all the baser and more shameful in Christians not to imitate at least the heathen. Adultery is punished no less severely by the Julian law   				   <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>
  				   than by that of God; whilst those who boast themselves of the Christian name are so tender and remiss, that they visit this execrable offense with a very light reproof. And lest they should abrogate God’s law without a pretext, they allege the example of Christ, who dismissed the woman taken in adultery, whereas she ought to have been stoned; just as He withdrew Himself into a mountain that He might not be made a king by the multitude.

For if we consider what the office was which the Father delegated to His only-begotten Son, we shall not be surprised that He was content with the limits of His vocation, and did not discharge the duties of a Judge.

The severity of the punishment is now extended further, and a betrothed woman is counted as a wife; and this for a very good reason, because she has plighted her troth, and it is a token of abandoned incontinency for the mind of a woman to be so alienated from the man to whom 				  she is betrothed, as to prostitute her virginity to another’s embraces. But since one who has been ravished is not criminal, a woman is absolved if she be forced in a field, because it is probable that she yielded unwillingly, inasmuch as she was far from assistance. Although, however, the terms are accommodated to the comprehension of a rude people, it was the intention of God to distinguish force from consent.

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.1"></a>From this passage, as well as other similar ones, it plainly appears how many vices were of necessity tolerated in this people. It was altogether an act of barbarism that fathers should sell their children for the relief of their poverty, still it could not be corrected as might have been hoped. Again, the sanctity of the marriage-vow should have been greater than that it should be allowable for a master to 				  repudiate his bond-maid, after he had betrothed her to himself as his wife; or, when he had betrothed her to his son, to make void that covenant, which is inviolable: for that principle ought ever to hold good — “Those whom God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (<a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006">Mt 19:6</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.2"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.3"></a>; <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009">Mr 10:9</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.4"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.5"></a>.) Yet liberty was accorded to the ancient people in all these particulars; only provision is here made that the poor girls should not suffer infamy and injury from their repudiation. But, although God is gracious in remitting the punishment, still He shows that chastity is pleasing to Him, as far as the people’s hardness of heart permitted. First of all, He does not allow a master to seduce his purchased maid-servant, but if he wishes to enjoy her embraces, a 				  marriage must take place; for although He does not set this out in express terms, still we may infer from what He condemns, that the contrary is what He approves. From whence, too, their notion is refuted who suppose that fornication was lawful under the Law. But the words must be more closely examined on account of their ambiguity. First, the sex is treated with consideration, that the condition of a female may be somewhat more favorable than that of a male; since, otherwise, their weakness 				  would render young women subject to injury and shame. An explanation then follows, respecting which, however, interpreters differ; for some read the particle <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.6"></a>לא<a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.7"></a>,   				   <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a>
  				   <i>lo</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.12"></a>, which is properly negative, for <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.13"></a>לו<a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.14"></a>, <i>lo</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.15"></a>; and hence arise two opposite meanings — If he hath, or hath <i>not</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.16"></a>, betrothed her to himself. If it be preferred to take it affirmatively, the meaning of the 				  precept will be: If a master shall repudiate his bond-maid, whom he has loved and destined to be his wife, he must give her her liberty; for although literally it is, “he shall cause her to be redeemed,” yet; the context shows that the obligation of setting her free is laid upon him; nor is this contradicted by the fact that he is only deprived of the power of selling her to a strange people; since I do not understand this as applying to foreigners only, but to others of his own nation, since 				  sometimes those of another tribe or family are called strangers. For, even though there were no marriage-compact, it was not otherwise lawful to sell slaves of the holy and elect people to foreigners. Besides, amongst the Israelites, slavery was only temporary. But, to pass by everything else, let it suffice to observe the absurdity that a master should hold his wife as a slave to be sold at pleasure, if their opinion is received who suppose that the words refer to repudiation after 				  betrothal.   				   <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>
  				  <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p18.1"></a> I myself rather approve of the other opinion, that, although the master shall not have aspired to matrimony with her, if her appearance displeases him so that he would be unwilling to have her as his wife, at least he must provide for her redemption; because her chastity would be in jeopardy if she remained with him unmarried; unless perhaps Moses may signify that, after she had been seduced, her master did not honor her with marriage. But the other view which I 				  have just expressed is more simple; and a caution is given lest masters should seduce their maid-servants at their pleasure. Thus the word <i>despise</i>   				   <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a>
  				  <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p19.1"></a> does not refer to repudiation, but is opposed to beauty, or conjugal love.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p20"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p20.1"></a>The next case is, that if he should betroth her to his son, (he must give her a dowry,   				   <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a>
  				   <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.1"></a>) in which, also, her modesty and honor is consulted, lest she should be oppressed by the right of ownership, and become a harlot. In the third place, it is provided that, if she should be repudiated, her condition should not be disadvantageous. If, therefore, he would make her his daughter-in-law, and betroth her to his son, he is commanded to deal liberally with her; for “after the manner of daughters” is equivalent to giving her a 				  dowry, or, at any rate, to treating her as if she were free. Finally, he adds that, if he should choose another wife for his son, he should not reject the former one, nor defraud her of her food and raiment, or of some third thing, concerning which translators are not well agreed. Some render it <i>time</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.2"></a>, but I do not see what is the meaning of <i>diminishing</i> <i>her</i> <i>time</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.3"></a>; others, <i>duty</i> <i>of</i> <i>marriage</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.4"></a>, but this is too free a translation; others, more correctly, <i>affliction</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.5"></a>, since the girl would be humiliated by her repudiation; still, to diminish affliction, is too harsh an expression for to compensate 				  an injury. Let my readers, then, consider whether the word, <a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.6"></a>ענתה<a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.7"></a>, <i>gnonathah</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.8"></a>, is not used for <i>compact</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.9"></a> or <i>agreement</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.10"></a>; for thus the context will run very well: If his son have married another wife, that the girl who has suffered 				  ignominious rejection should obtain her rights as to food, and raiment, and her appointed dowry; otherwise, God commands that she should be set free gratuitously, in order that her liberty may compensate for the wrong she has received.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.viii"></a>

The remedy is, that lie who has corrupted girl 				  should be compelled to marry her, and also to give tie a dowry from his own property, lest, if he should afterwards cast her off, she should go away from her bed penniless.

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.ix-p7"></a>The immunity here given has for its object the awakening of that mutual love which may preserve the conjugal fidelity of husband and wife; for there is danger lest, if a husband departs from his wife immediately after marriage, the bride, before she has become thoroughly accustomed to him, should be too prone to fall in love with some one else. A similar danger affects the husband; for in war, and other expeditions, many things occur 				  which tempt men to sin. God, therefore, would have the love of husband and wife fostered by their association for a whole year, that thus mutual confidence may be established between them, and they may afterwards continually beware of all incontinency.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.ix-p8"></a>But that God should permit a bride to enjoy herself with her husband, affords no trifling proof of His indulgence. Assuredly, it cannot be but that the lust of the flesh must affect the connection of husband and wife with some amount of sin; yet God not only pardons it, but covers it with the veil of holy matrimony, lest that which is sinful in itself should be so imputed; nay, He spontaneously allows them to enjoy themselves.

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p47"></a><b>11. </b><i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</i>. Although this ceremony appears to be part of the legal services, still I have thought fit to postpone it to this place, because it relates to the observance of the Seventh Commandment. The object of it is, lest women, trusting that they would escape punishment, should abandon themselves 				  to unchastity, or lest jealousy should lead to dissension, and, by alienating the mind of the husband from the wife, should loosen the ties of pure affection, since thus the door would be open to many iniquities. By this rite, therefore, God proclaims Himself the guardian and avenger of conjugal fidelity; and hence it appears how acceptable a sacrifice in His sight is the chastity of married women, of which He condescends to profess Himself the guardian. It is, therefore, no trifling 				  consolation to husbands, that God undertakes the cognizance of the secret wrong, if, perchance, their wives have dealt treacherously with them.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p48"></a>But it will be better to examine the details in order. When at the outset he says, — If a man’s wife go aside, and her offense be concealed, an absurdity appears to be implied; as if He would thus bring to judgment none but those who should be convicted, whereas, if the fact were established, there would be no use in the application of the test. But the condition, “if she commit a trespass against him,” does not signify that the 				  woman’s adultery should be discovered, but refers to the opinion of her husband; and thus the words must be paraphrased in this way: If any one should think that his wife has had connection with another man, and he cannot otherwise be relieved from the anxiety which oppresses him, let him appeal to God for that judgment, which is beyond the reach of man. Still God  				   <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a>
  				  seems designedly to have expressed the crime, lest husbands should heedlessly involve their innocent wives in disgrace. We know that many are causelessly suspicious; and when jealousy has once taken possession of the mind, there is no room for moderation or equity.  				   <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>
  				  Wherefore it would be inhuman to permit morose and unreasonable husbands to drag their wives to this horrible judgment of God on account of certain trifling suspicions. For, if the husband were cruel and ungodly, it would be like putting a sword into the hands of a madman, to give him such a power without any distinction. God, therefore, implies that the priest should carefully consider, so as not too easily to <i>receive</i> every complaint; although He afterwards more clearly 				  expresses Himself in another part of the conditions, “if a man be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled.”</p>  				
 <p><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p51"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p51.1"></a></p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p52"></a><b>15. </b><i>Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest</i>. This offering is different from the rest, which have been heretofore mentioned, because it is a kind of <i>adjuration</i>, whereby the woman exposes herself to be accursed. Pure meal without frankincense or oil is therefore 				  offered, since the rite   				   <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>
  				   of expiation would not be in accordance with the curse. That the woman may be more afraid of perjuring herself, she is presented before God, with her head uncovered too, as if the priest would drag her from her lurking-place; for it seems incongruous that, as some suppose, the veil was removed from her head in token of her infamy, since thus she would have been condemned before her case was heard. She is, then, brought before God’s face with her head bare, that 				  she may be seriously alarmed; and then follows the mode of absolution or condemnation. The priest is commanded to take holy water in an earthen vessel, to throw in some dust from the floor, and then a book or scroll, on which were written the words of the curse, so that the blots should remain in the water, and so to give the cup to the woman. Some interpret the holy water to be that which was kept ill the brazen laver, to be always ready for the ablution of those engaged in duly offering 				  sacrifices. Let my readers, however, consider whether he does not rather mean the water in which the ashes of the red heifer were sprinkled, and whereby solemn purifications were made, (<a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p53.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001">Nu 19:1</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.x-p53.1"></a>,) as we have already seen. For thus the woman was admonished that, if she perjured herself, no further means of expiation remained. The dust collected from the floor was also a sign of 				  detestation: in short, the whole proceedings were calculated to humble her, so that she might not double her offense by perjury. Besides, the priest is commanded to repeat the words of the curse, lest she should seek to escape by some subterfuge or other. The question, however, arises, why she should be compelled to imprecate evil upon herself rather than others were who were suspected of murder or other atrocious crimes? and I think it was for this reason, because no other offense can be so 				  easily concealed. Lest, therefore, women should grow hardened from their cunning and evil arts, a remedy is provided against their various deceptions; and thus God shows that the marriage-bed is under His protection and safeguard. We must remember, too, that this was not a mere empty bugbear, inasmuch as God undoubtedly appeared as the open avenger of unfaithfulness, according to His declaration. Nor is the threat added in vain, that if the woman be a deceiver, she should be a curse among the 				  people, because her belly should swell and her thigh dissolve; whilst, on the other hand, He does not promise in vain, that if she be innocent, she should not only be free, but prolific also; so that God’s blessing would be the seal of her absolution. For this is the meaning of the expression, “she shall be sown with seed;”   				   <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a>
  				   as, on the contrary, it was said that her thigh   				   <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">82</font></a>
  				   should dissolve when she wasted away with barrenness. We infer, from the opposite effects of the same water, that by the outward symbol God wrought with His <i>secret</i> power as the occasion demanded.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.xi"></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xi-p23"></a><b>13. </b><i>If any man take a wife</i>. This passage also tends to the exaltation of chastity. God provides against both cases, lest a husband should unjustly bring reproach upon a chaste and innocent young woman, and lest a young woman, having been defiled, should escape punishment, if she pretended to be a virgin. A third object 				  is also to be remarked, viz., that parents were thus admonished to be more careful in watching over their children. This is, indeed, an act of gross brutality, that a husband, wittingly and willingly, should seek a false pretext for divorcing his wife by bringing reproach and infamy upon her; but, since it does not infrequently happen that the libidinous become disgusted with their vices, and then endeavor to rid themselves of them in every way, it was needful to correct this evil, and to 				  prescribe a method whereby the integrity of the woman should be safe from the calumnies of an ungodly and cruel husband; whilst it was also just to give relief to an honest man, lest he should be compelled to cherish in his bosom a harlot, by whom he had been deceived; for it is a very bitter thing to ingenuous minds silently to endure so great an ignominy. An admirable precaution is here laid down, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., that if a woman were accused by her husband, it was in the power of her parents to produce the tokens of chastity which should acquit her; but if they did not, that the husband should not be obliged against his will to keep her in his house, after she had been defiled by another. It is plain from this passage, that the tokens of virginity were taken on a cloth, on the first night of marriage, as future proofs of chastity. It is also probable that the 				  cloth was laid up before witnesses as a pledge, to be a sure defense for pure and modest young women; for it would have been giving too much scope to the parents if it had been believed simply on their evidence; but Moses speaks briefly as of a well-known custom.</p>

If any should object that it was a bad provision for the unhappy woman that she should be subjected for ever to tyrannical rule, I reply, that this was done because there was no means for her release; for although, as we shall presently see, men were permitted to obtain 				  a divorce from their wives, still it was neither just nor right to overthrow God’s earliest institution. Besides, it was necessary to obviate the trick of the husband who would have gloried in her divorce, as having gained what he desired.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13"></a>Although what relates to divorce was granted in indulgence to the Jews, yet Christ pronounces that it was never in accordance with the Law, because it is directly repugnant to the first institution of God, from whence a perpetual and inviolable rule is to be sought. It is proverbially said that the laws of nature are indissoluble; and God has declared once for all, that the bond of union between husband and wife is closer than that 				  of parent and child; wherefore, if a son cannot shake off the paternal yoke, no cause can permit the dissolution of the connection which a man has with his wife. Hence it appears how great was the perverseness of that nation, which could not be restrained from dissolving a most sacred and inviolable tie. Meanwhile the Jews improperly concluded from their impunity that that was lawful, which God did not punish because of the hardness of their hearts; whereas they ought rather to have 				  <i>considered</i>, agreeably to the answer of Christ, that man is not at liberty to separate those whom God hath joined together. (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006">Mt 19:6</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.1"></a>.) Still, God chose to make a provision for women who were cruelly oppressed, and for whom it was better that they should at once be set free, than that they should groan beneath a cruel tyranny during their whole lives. Thus, in Malachi, divorce is preferred to 				  polygamy, since it would be a more tolerable condition to be divorced than to bear with a harlot and a rival. (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014">Mal 2:14</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.2"></a>.) And undoubtedly the bill or scroll of divorce, whilst it cleared the woman from all disgrace, cast some reproach on the husband; for he who confesses that he puts away his wife, because she does not please him, brings himself under the accusation both of moroseness and 				  inconstancy. For what gross levity and disgraceful inconstancy it shows, that a husband should be so offended with some imperfection or disease in his wife, as to east away from him half of himself! We see, then, that husbands were indirectly condemned by the writing of divorce, since they thus committed an injury against their wives who were chaste, and in other respects what they should be. On these grounds, God in Isaiah, in order that He might take away from the Jews all subject of 				  complaint, bids them produce the bill of divorce, if He had given any to their mother, (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001">Isa 1:1</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.3"></a>;) as much as to say, that His cause for rejecting them was just, because they had treacherously revolted to ungodliness.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14"></a>Some interpreters do not read these three verses continuously, but suppose the sense to be complete at the end of the first, wherein the husband testifies that he divorces his wife for no offense, but because her beauty does not satisfy his lust. If, however, we give more close attention, we shall see that it is only one provision of the Law, viz., that when a man has divorced his wife, it is not lawful for him to marry her again 				  if she have married another. The reason of the law is, that, by prostituting his wife, he would be, as far as in him lay, acting like a procurer. In this view, it is said that she was defiled, because he had contaminated her body, for the liberty which he gave her could not abolish the first institution of God, but rather, as Christ teaches, gave cause for adultery. (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031">Mt 5:31</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14.1"></a>, and 19:9.) Thus, the 				  Israelites were reminded that, although they divorced their wives with impunity, still this license was by no means excused before God.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.xiii"></a>

  				   The enormity of the crime is seen by the severity of the punishment; and surely, when a man and woman abandon themselves to so disgraceful an act, it is plain that there are no remains of modesty in them. God, therefore, does not only regard the offense itself, but the brutal impulse of lust, whereby men are so carried away as to degenerate from the very feelings of nature. For what wickedness would he abstain from who yields to such impurity, that he breaks 				  through an obstacle in his fury which restrains the brutes themselves? Let us not wonder, then, that God is a severe avenger of such obscenity.</p>

  				  has no other tendency than that believers should be kept far from all filthiness, and that chastity may flourish among them. It is indeed true that a woman, under these circumstances, is withheld from connection with a man by the very foulness of the disease, whilst there is also danger of contagion; but God rather chooses here to be an instructor in decency to His people, than to perform the office of a physician. It must be remembered, therefore, that men are warned against all 				  indelicacy, which is abhorrent to the natural sense; and, by <i>synecdoche</i>, married persons are exhorted to restrain themselves from all immodest lasciviousness, and that the husband should enjoy his wife’s embraces with delicacy and propriety.</p>  <a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv"></a>

For it was not God’s intention here merely to exhort the people to the study of the Law, but the address respecting the keeping of His statutes is directed to the present cause, since He does not refer indifferently to all the statutes of Himself and of the Gentiles, but restricts Himself to the subject-matter, as it is called; and thus, by the statutes of the Gentiles, He means those corruptions whereby they had perverted 				  His pure institution as to holy matrimony. First, however, tie forbids them from following the customs of the Egyptians, and then includes all the Canaanitish nations. For, since all the Orientals are libidinous, they never had any scruple in polluting themselves by incestuous marriages; whilst it is abundantly proved by history, how great were the excesses of the Egyptians   				   <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a>

For nothing is more absurd than for us to fix our minds on the actions of men, and not on God’s word, in which is to be found the rule of a holy life.

We may, therefore, define these female relations of blood to be those which are spoken of immediately afterwards, viz., that a son should not marry his mother, nor a son-in-law his mother-in-law; nor a paternal or maternal uncle his niece, nor a grandfather his granddaughter, nor a brother his sister, nor a nephew his paternal or maternal aunt, or his uncle’s wife, nor a father-in-law his daughter-in-law, nor a brother-in-law his 				  brother’s wife, nor a step-father his stepdaughter. The Roman laws accord with the rule prescribed by God, as if their authors had learnt from Moses what was decorous and agreeable to nature. The phrase which God uses frequently “to uncover the turpitude,” is intended to awaken abhorrence, in order that the Israelites may beware more diligently of all incest. The Hebrew word, indeed, <a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.2"></a>ערוה<a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.3"></a>, <i>gnervah</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.4"></a>, signifies <i>nakedness</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.5"></a>, therefore some translate it actively, “the nakedness of thy father,” <i>i</i> <i>e</i><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.6"></a>., the womb which thy father hath uncovered; but this meaning would not be suitable to the nakedness of thy daughter, or thy daughter-in-law, or thy sister. Consequently, there is no 				  doubt but that Moses means to denote that it is a filthy and shameful thing.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p45"></a>We must remember, what I have already hinted, that not only are incestuous connections out of wedlock condemned, but that the degrees are pointed out, within which marriages are unlawful. It is true, indeed, that this was a part of the political constitution which God established for His ancient people; still, it must be borne in mind, that whatever is prescribed here is deduced from the source of rectitude itself, and from the 				  natural feelings implanted in us by Him. Absurd is the cleverness which some persons but little versed in Scripture pretend to,  				   <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">87</font></a>
  				  who assert that the Law being abrogated, the obligations under which Moses laid his countrymen are now dissolved; for it is to be inferred from the preface above expounded, that. the instruction here given is not, nor ought to be accounted, merely political. For, since their lusts had led astray all the neighboring nations into incest, God, in order to inculcate chastity amongst his people, says; “I am the Lord your God, ye shall therefore keep my statutes; walk not after the 				  doings of the land of Egypt and of Canaan;” and then He adds what are the degrees of consanguinity and affinity within which the marriage of men and women is forbidden. If any again object that what has been disobeyed in many countries is not to be accounted the law of the Gentiles, the reply is easy, viz., that the barbarism, which prevailed in the East, does not nullify that chastity which is opposed to the abominations of the Gentiles; since what is natural cannot be abrogated by any consent 				  or custom. In short, the prohibition of incests here set forth, is by no means of the number of those laws which are commonly abrogated according to the circumstances of time and place, since it flows from the fountain of nature itself, and is founded on the general principle of all laws, which is perpetual and inviolable. Certainly God declares that the custom which had prevailed amongst the heathen was displeasing to Him; and why is this, but because nature itself repudiates and abhors 				  filthiness, although approved of by the consent (<i>suffragiis</i>) of men? Wherefore, when God would by this distinction separate His chosen people from heathen nations, we may assuredly conclude that the incests which He commands them to avoid are absolute pollutions. Paul, on a very trifling point, sets before our <i>eyes</i> the law of nature; for, when he teaches that it is shameful and indecorous for women to appear in public without veils, he desires them to consider, whether it would be 				  decent for them to present themselves publicly with their heads shorn; and finally adds, that nature itself does not permit it. (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p46.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014">1Co 11:14</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p46.1"></a>.) Wherefore, I do not see, that, under the pretext of its being a political Law,  				   <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a>
  				  the purity of nature is to be abolished, from whence arises the distinction between the statutes of God, and the abuses of the Gentiles. If this discipline were founded on the utility of a single people, or on the custom of a particular time, or on present necessity, or on any other circumstances, the laws deduced from it might be abrogated for new reasons, or their observance might be dispensed with in regard to particular persons, by special privilege; but since, in their 				  enactment, the perpetual decency of nature was alone regarded, not even a dispensation of them would be permissible. It may indeed be decreed that it should be lawful and unpunished, since it is in the power of princes to remit penalties; yet no legislator can effect that a thing, which nature pronounces to be vicious, should not be vicious; and, if tyrannical arrogance dares to attempt it, the light of nature will presently shine forth and prevail. When, formerly, the Emperor Claudius had 				  married his niece Agrippina,  				   <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>
  				  for the purpose of averting the shame, he procured a <i>Senatusconsultum</i>, which licensed such marriages; yet no one was found to imitate his example, except one freedman. Hence, just and reasonable men will acknowledge that, even amongst heathen nations, this Law was accounted indissoluble, as if implanted and engraved on the hearts of men. On this ground Paul, more severely to reprove the incest of a step-son with his father’s wife, says, that such an occurrence “is not so 				  much as named among the Gentiles.” (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p48.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001">1Co 5:1</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p48.1"></a>.)</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p49"></a>If it be objected that such marriages are not prohibited to us in the New Testament, I reply, that the marriage of a father with his daughter is not forbidden; nor is a mother prohibited from marrying her son; and shall it therefore be lawful for those, who are near of kin, to form promiscuous connections?  				   <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>
  				  Although Paul expressly mentions only one kind of incest, yet he establishes its disgrace by adducing the example of the Gentiles, that at least we should be ashamed if more delicacy and chastity is seen amongst them. And:. in fact, another admonition of the same Paul is enough for me, who thus writes to the Philippians:</p>  				
 <p class="SCRIPTURE25"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51"></a>“Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008">Php 4:8</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51.1"></a>.)</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p52"></a>As to those who ascend or descend ill a direct line, it, sufficiently appears that there is a monstrous indecency in the connection of father and daughter, or mother and son. A licentious poet,  				   <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>
  				  being about to relate the frantic incest of Myrrha, says:</p>  				
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent27"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p55"></a><i>“Daughters</i> <i>and</i> <i>fathers,</i> <i>from</i> <i>my</i> <i>song</i> <i>retire,<br> 				  I</i> <i>sing</i> <i>of</i> <i>horror.”</i></p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p56"></a>In the collateral line, the uncles on both sides represent the father, and the aunts the mother; and, consequently, connection with them is forbidden, inasmuch as it would be of somewhat similar impropriety. The same rule affects affinity; for the step-mother, or mother-in-law, is held to stand in the relation of mother; and the step-daughter, or daughter-in-law, in that of daughter; as also the wife of the paternal or maternal 				  uncle is to be regarded in the relation of mother. And, although express mention may not be made of it here, we must form our judgment by analogy as to what is prohibited; — the uncle on the father’s or mother’s side is not here forbidden to marry his niece; but, since the nephew is interdicted from marrying his paternal or maternal aunt, the mutual relation of the inferior to the superior degree must prevail. But if any should contend that there is a difference, the reason added by Moses 				  refutes his objection, for it is said, “She is thy father’s or thy mother’s near kinswoman.” Hence it follows, that a niece is guilty of incest if she marries her uncle on either side. As to brothers and sisters, God pronounces that marriage with a sister, although she be not uterine, is unlawful; for He forbids the uncovering of the turpitude of a sister, who is either the daughter of thy father or thy mother.</p>  				
 <p><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p57"></a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p57.1"></a></p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p58"></a><b>16. </b><i>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife</i>. They are bad   				   <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
  				   interpreters who raise a controversy on this passage, and expound it, that a brother’s wife must not be taken from his bed, or, if she be divorced, that manage with her would be unlawful whilst her husband was still alive; for it is incongruous to twist into different senses declarations which are made in the same place, and in the same words. God forbids the uncovering of the turpitude of the wife of a father, an uncle, and a son; and when He lays down the same 				  rule respecting a brother’s wife in the very same words, it is absurd to invent a different meaning for them. If, therefore, it be not lawful to marry the wife of a father, a son, an uncle, or a nephew, we must. hold precisely the same opinion with respect to a brother’s wife, concerning whom an exactly similar law is enacted in the same passage and context. I am not, however, ignorant of the source from whence those, who think otherwise, have derived their mistake; for, whereas God gives a 				  command in another place, that if a man shall have died without issue, his surviving brother shall take his widow to wife, in order that he may raise up of her seed to the departed, (<a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p59.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005">De 25:5</a><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p59.1"></a>,) they have incorrectly and ignorantly restricted this to own-brothers, although God rather designates other degrees of relationship. It is a well-known Hebrew idiom, to embrace 				  under the name of brother all near kinsmen in general; and the Latins also formerly so denominated cousins-german.   				   <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a>
  				   The law, then, now before us, respecting marriage with a deceased brother’s wife, is only addressed to those relations who are not otherwise prohibited from such a marriage, since it was not God’s purpose to prevent the loss of a deceased person’s name by permitting those incestuous marriages, which tie had elsewhere condemned. Wherefore these two points agree perfectly well, that an own-brother was prohibited from marrying his brother’s widow, whilst the next 				  of kin were obliged to raise up seed for the dead, by the right of their relationship, wherever their marriage was otherwise permissible by the enactment’s of the law. On this ground Boaz married Ruth, who had previously been married to his near kinsman; and it is abundantly clear from the history, that the law applied to all the near kinsmen. But if any still contend that own-brothers were included in the number of these, on the same grounds the daughter-in-law must be married by her 				  father-in-law, and the nephew’s wife by the uncle, and even the mother-in-law by the son-in-law, which it is an abomination to speak of. If any object that Er, Onan, and Shelah, the sons of Judah, were own-brothers, and still that Tamar married two of them, the difficulty is easily solved, viz., that Judah, following the common and received practice of the Gentiles, acted improperly in permitting it. It is plain enough, from the histories of all ages, that there were disgusting and shameless 				  mixtures in the marriages of Oriental nations. By evil communications, then, as is ever the case, Judah was led into giving the same wife to his second son as had before been married to the eldest. And, in fact, God expressly says that this offense was rife among the Gentiles, where tie condemns incestuous connections. This, therefore, I still hold to be unquestionable, that, by the law of Moses, marriage with the widow of an own-brother is forbidden.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p62"></a><b>18. </b><i>Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister</i>. By this passage certain froward persons pretend that it is permitted, if a man has lost his wife, to marry her own sister, because the restriction is added, not to take the one in the lifetime of the other. From whence they infer, that it is not forbidden that she 				  should succeed in the place of the deceased. But they ought to have considered the intention of the legislator from his own express words, for mention is made not only of incest and filthiness, but of the jealousy and quarrels, which arise from hence. If it had merely been said, “Thou shalt not uncover her turpitude,” there would have been some color to their pretext, that the husband being a widower, he would be free to marry his wife’s sister; but, when a different object for the law is 				  expressly stated, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., lest she, who was legally married, should be troubled by quarrels and contentions, it is plain that the license for polygamy is restricted by this exception, in order that the Israelites should be contented with one evil, and, at least, should not expose two sisters to hostile contention with each other. The condition of the first wife was already painful enough, when she 				  was compelled to put up with a rival and a concubine; but it was more intolerable to be constantly quarrelling with her near relative. The name of sister is not, therefore, restricted, I think, to actual sisters, but other relations are included in it, whose marriages would not otherwise have been incestuous. In a word, it is not incest which is condemned, so much as the cruelty of a husband, if he chose to contract a further marriage with the near kinswoman of his wife. Nor can we come to any 				  other conclusion from the words of Moses; for if the turpitude of a brother is uncovered when his brother marries his widow, no less is the turpitude of a sister uncovered when her sister marries her husband after her decease. But hence we plainly see the diabolical arrogance of the Pope, who, by inventing new degrees of kindred, would be wiser than God; whilst he also betrays his cunning, because from this kind of sport he made himself a fat game-bag.</p>  				
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p63"></a>Since from long custom it is established that cousins-german should not marry, we must beware of giving scandal lest too unbridled a liberty should expose the Gospel to much reproach; and we must bear in mind Paul’s admonition, to abstain even from things lawful when they are not expedient.

Since Moses does not here refer to any other kinds of incest, but speaks only of that with a step-mother, it is probable that, what he had more fully set forth before he here briefly recalled to the minds of the Israelites under a single head. At any rate, the prohibition of one 				  offense does not open the gate to other abominations. The expression which he adds, “nor discover his father’s skirt,” is as much as to say, that the father is exposed to shame when the step-son has; no regard to decency, and goes in to his step-mother. Perhaps he alludes to the sin of Ham, who betrayed his ungodliness by exposing the shame of his father.
