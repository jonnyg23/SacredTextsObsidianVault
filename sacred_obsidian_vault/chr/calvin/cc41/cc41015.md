 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p16"></a><b>1.</b> <i>For this cause.</i> Paul’s imprisonment, which ought to have been held as a confirmation of his apostleship, was undoubtedly presented by his adversaries in an opposite light. He therefore points out to the Ephesians that his chains served to prove and to declare his calling; and that the only reason why he had been imprisoned was, that he had 		preached the gospel to the Gentiles. His unshaken firmness was no small additional proof that he had discharged his office in a proper manner.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p17"></a><i>The prisoner of Jesus Christ.</i>   		 <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">131</font></a>
  		 To strengthen his authority still more, he speaks in lofty terms of his prison. In the presence of the world and of wicked men, this might have appeared to be foolish boasting; but, in addressing godly persons, it was a dignified and faithful manner. The glory of Christ not only overcomes the ignominy of the chains, but converts what was in itself a reproach into the highest honor. If he had merely said, “I am a 		prisoner,” this would not have conveyed the idea of his being an ambassador. Imprisonment alone has no claim to this honor, being usually the mark of wickedness and crime. But the crowns and sceptres of kings, to say nothing of the imposing splendor of an ambassador, are less honorable than the chains of a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Men might think otherwise, but it is our duty to judge of the reasons. So highly ought the name of Christ to be 		revered by us, that what men consider to be the greatest reproach, ought to be viewed by us as the greatest honour.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p19"></a><i>For you Gentiles.</i> Another circumstance greatly fitted to interest the Ephesians was, that the persecutions of Paul were endured for the Gentiles, — that his troubles and dangers were on their account.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.i-p20"></a><a name="iv.iv.i-p20.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p21"></a><b>2.</b> <i>If ye have heard.</i> There is reason to believe, that, while Paul was at Ephesus, he had said nothing on these subjects, no necessity for doing so having arisen; for no controversy had taken place among them about the calling of the Gentiles. If he had made any mention of them in his discourses, he would have reminded the Ephesians of his former 		statements, instead of referring generally, as he now does, to common report and to his own Epistle. He did not, of his own accord, raise unnecessary disputes. It was only when the wickedness of his adversaries made it necessary, that he reluctantly undertook the defense of his ministry. <i>Dispensation</i> (οικονομια) means here a divine order or command, or, as it is generally expressed, a 		<i>commission</i></p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.i-p22"></a><a name="iv.iv.i-p22.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p23"></a><b>3.</b> <i>That by revelation.</i> Some might imagine, that, in attempting to discharge the office of an apostle, he had acted rashly, and was now paying the penalty of his rashness. It was this that made him so earnest in pleading the Divine authority for all his transactions. The present instance, on account of its novelty, had few supporters; and therefore 		he calls it a <i>mystery.</i> By this name he endeavors to remove the prejudice which the general displeasure at the event was fitted to excite. His own personal interest in the matter was less regarded than that of the Ephesians, who were deeply concerned in the information, that, through the settled purpose of God, they had been called by Paul’s ministry. Lest what is little known should forthwith become the object of suspicion, the word <i>mystery</i> places it in opposition to the perverse judgments and opinions which were then prevalent in the world.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p24"></a><i>By revelation he made known to me the mystery.</i> Paul draws the line of distinction between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and to the Holy Spirit their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of revelations, but it is a false boast. Paul was persuaded that his revelation was true, could prove it to others, and speaks of it as a fact of which no doubt could be 		entertained.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p25"></a><i>As I wrote a little before.</i> This refers either to a rapid glance at the same subject in the second chapter, or — which appears to be the general opinion — to another Epistle. If the former exposition be adopted, it will be proper to translate, <i>as I wrote before in few words;</i> for the subject had received nothing more than a passing notice; but the 		latter being, as I have said, the prevailing opinion, I prefer translating, <i>as I wrote a little before.</i> The phrase, (ἐν ὀλίγῳ,) which Erasmus has translated <i>in a few words,</i> appears rather to refer to time. On this supposition there would be an implied comparison between the present and the former writings. But nothing would be more unlike the 		fact, than to contrast them on the score of brevity; for a more concise mode of expression than this passing glance can hardly be imagined. The phrase, <i>a little before,</i> seems purposely to be used as an appeal to their remembrance of a recent occurrence, though I do not insist on this point. There is more difficulty in the next verse.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.i-p26"></a><a name="iv.iv.i-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p27"></a><b>4.</b> <i>By attending to which, ye may understand,</i> πρὸς ὃ δύνασθε ἀναγινώσκοντες νοὢσαι. Erasmus renders it, “from which things, when ye read, ye may understand.” But to translate ἀναγινώσκειν τι as signifying <i>to read</i> is, I think, at variance with Greek syntax. I leave it as a subject of consideration, whether it does not rather signify <i>to attend</i>. The participle would then be connected with the preposition πρὸς, in the commencement of the verse, and the clause would run thus, 		<i>to which when ye attend, ye may understand</i>  If, however, by viewing the verb ἀναγινώσκοντες, as disjoined from the preposition, you make it signify <i>reading,</i> the meaning will still be, “by reading you may understand according to what I have written;” taking the phrase πρὸς ὃ, <i>to which,</i> as equivalent to καθ ᾿ ὃ, <i>according to which;</i> but I suggest this merely as a doubtful conjecture.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p28"></a>If we adopt the view which is almost universally approved, that the apostle had formerly written to the Ephesians, this is not the only Epistle which we have lost. And yet there is no room for the sneers of the ungodly, as if the Scriptures had been mutilated, or in any part had become imperfect. If we duly consider Paul’s earnestness, — his watchfulness and care, — his zeal and fervor, — his kindness and readiness in assisting brethren, — 		we shall be led to regard it as highly probable that he would write many epistles, both of a public and private nature, to various places. Those which the Lord judged to be necessary for his church have been selected by his providence for everlasting remembrance. Let us rest assured, that what is left is enough for us, and that the smallness of the remaining number is not the result of accident; but that the body of Scripture, which is in our possession, has been adjusted by the wonderful 		counsel of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p29"></a><i>My knowledge.</i> The frequent mention of this point shews the necessity that the calling of ministers should be firmly believed both by themselves and by their people. But Paul looks more to others than to himself. He had everywhere indeed given great offense by preaching the gospel indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles, but his solicitude was not chiefly on his own account. There were not a few who, 		overwhelmed by the slanders of wicked men, began to doubt of his apostleship, and whose faith was consequently shaken. It was this that induced him so frequently to remind the Ephesians that he knew the will and command of God who called him to the office. —<i> In the mystery of Christ,</i></p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.i-p30"></a><a name="iv.iv.i-p30.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p31"></a><b>5.</b> <i>Which in other ages was not made known.</i> He had simply called it a <i>mystery,</i> but now calls it <i>a mystery of Christ,</i> because it was necessary that it should remain hidden, until it was revealed by his coming; just as the appellation of “prophecies of Christ” may be given to those which relate to his kingdom. We must first explain the word <i>mystery,</i> and then inquire why it is said to have remained unknown in all ages. The <i>mystery</i> was,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.i-p32"></a>“that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.i-p32.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006">Eph 3:6</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p32.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p33"></a>When this name is given to the gospel, it has other meanings, which do not apply to the present passage. The calling of the Gentiles, then, was a “mystery of Christ;” that is, it was to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p34"></a>But why does he affirm that it was not known, when it had been the subject of so many predictions? The prophets everywhere declare, that people shall come from every nation in the world, to worship God; that an altar shall be erected both in Assyria and in Egypt, and that all alike shall speak the language of Canaan. (<a name="iv.iv.i-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018">Isa 19:18</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p34.1"></a>.) It is intimated by 		these words, that the worship of the true God, and the same profession of faith, will be everywhere diffused. Of the Messiah it is predicted, that he shall have dominion from east to west, and that all nations shall serve him. (<a name="iv.iv.i-p34.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008">Ps. 72:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011">11</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p34.2"></a>.) We see also, that many passages to this purpose are quoted by the apostles, not only from the later prophets, but from Moses. How could that be hidden 		which had been proclaimed by so many heralds? Why are all without exception pronounced to have been in ignorance? Shall we say, that the prophets spake what they did not understand, and uttered sounds without meaning?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p35"></a>I answer, the words of Paul must not be understood to mean that there had been no knowledge at all on these subjects. There had always been some of the Jewish nation who acknowledged that, at the advent of the Messiah, the grace of God would be proclaimed throughout the whole world, and who looked forward to the renovation of the human race. The prophets themselves, though they spoke with the certainty of revelation, left the time and 		manner undetermined. They knew that some communication of the grace of God would be made to the Gentiles, but at what time, in what manner, and by what means it should be accomplished, they had no information whatever. This ignorance was exemplified in a remarkable way by the apostles. They had not only been instructed by the predictions of the prophets, but had heard the distinct statement of their Master, (<a name="iv.iv.i-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016">Joh 10:16</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p35.1"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p36"></a>“Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one shepherd;”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p37"></a>and yet the novelty of the subject prevented them from understanding it fully. Nay, after they had received the injunction,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.i-p38"></a>“Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,” (<a name="iv.iv.i-p38.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015">Mr 16:15</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p38.1"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p39"></a>and,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p40"></a>“Ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth,” (<a name="iv.iv.i-p40.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008">Ac 1:8</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p40.1"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p41"></a>they dreaded and recoiled from the calling of the Gentiles as a proposal absolutely monstrous, because the manner of its accomplishment was still unknown. Before the actual event arrived, they had dark and confused apprehensions of our Savior’s words; for ceremonies were</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.i-p42"></a>“a vail over their face, that they could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.” (<a name="iv.iv.i-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013">2Co 3:13</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p42.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p43"></a>With unquestionable propriety, therefore, does Paul call this a <i>mystery,</i> and say, that it had been hidden; for the repeal of the ceremonial law, which admitted them within the vail, was not understood.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p44"></a><i>As it is now revealed.</i> To lay claim to information which none of the patriarchs, prophets, or holy kings, had possessed, might wear the aspect of arrogance. To guard against this imputation, Paul reminds them, first, that in this respect he was not alone, but shared the <i>revelation</i> with the most eminent teachers of the church; and, secondly, that it 		was the gift of the Holy Spirit, who has a right to bestow it on whom he pleases; for there is no other limit of our knowledge but that which he assigns to us.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.i-p45"></a>These few words, <i>as it is now revealed,</i> throw additional light on the admission of the Gentiles to be the people of God. It is on the condition that they shall be placed on a level with the Jews, and form one body. That the novelty might give no offense, he states that this must be accomplished <i>by the gospel.</i> 		(<a name="iv.iv.i-p45.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006">Eph 3:6</a><a name="iv.iv.i-p45.1"></a>.) Now, the gospel was itself a novelty; for it had never till now been heard of, and yet was acknowledged by all the godly to have come from heaven. Where, then, was the wonder, if, in renewing the world, God should follow an unwonted method?</p>  <a name="iv.iv.ii"></a>  	  		 		     		  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p1"></a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007">Ephesians 3:7-13</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p18"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Of which I was made a minister.</i> Having declared the gospel to be the instrument employed in communicating grace to the Gentiles, he now adds, that he <i>was made a minister</i> of the Gospel; and thus applies to himself the general statements which had been made. But, to avoid claiming for himself more 		than is proper, he affirms that it is<i> the gift of the grace of God,</i> and that this gift was an exhibition of divine <i>power.</i> As if he had said, “Inquire not what I have deserved; for in the free exercise of kindness, the Lord made me an apostle of the Gentiles, not for any excellence of mine, but by his own grace. Inquire not what I formerly was; for 		it is the Lord’s prerogative to ‘exalt them of low degree.’” (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052">Lu 1:52</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p18.1"></a>.) To produce something great out of nothing, shews <i>the effectual working of his power.</i></p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p19"></a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p19.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p20"></a><b>8.</b><i> To me, who am the least.</i> He labors to exhibit himself, and everything that belongs to him, in as humiliating a light as possible, in order that the grace of God may be the more highly exalted. But this acknowledgment had the additional effect of anticipating the objections which his adversaries might bring against him. “Who is this man that God should have raised him above all his brethren? What superior excellence did he possess that he should be chosen in preference to all the others?” All such comparisons of personal worth are set aside by the confession, that he was<i> the least of all the saints.</i></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p21"></a>This is no hypocritical declaration. Most men are ready enough to make professions of feigned humility, while their minds are swelled with pride, and in words to acknowledge themselves inferior to every one else, while they wish to be regarded with the highest esteem, and think themselves entitled to the highest honor. Paul is perfectly sincere in admitting his unworthiness; nay, at other times he speaks of himself in far more degrading 		language.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p22"></a>“For I am the least of the apostles, and am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009">1Co 15:9</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p22.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p23"></a>“Christ Jesus came into the world to save <i>sinners, of whom I am</i> <i>chief</i>”<br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015">1Ti 1:15</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p23.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p24"></a>But let us observe, that, when he speaks of himself as the meanest of all, he confines his attention to what he was in himself, apart from the grace of God. As if he had said, that his own worthlessness did not prevent him from being appointed, while others were passed by, to be the apostle of the Gentiles. <i>The grace of God given to me</i> is the expression used by him, to intimate that it was a peculiar gift, as compared with what had 		been bestowed on others. Not that he alone had been elected to discharge that office, but that he held the highest rank among “the teachers of the Gentiles,” — a title which he employs on another occasion as peculiar to himself.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p25"></a>“I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not,) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007">1Ti 2:7</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p25.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p26"></a>By <i>the unsearchable riches of Christ </i>are meant the astonishing and boundless treasures of grace, which God had suddenly and unexpectedly bestowed on the Gentiles. The Ephesians are thus reminded how eagerly the gospel ought to be embraced, and how highly it ought to be esteemed. This subject has been treated in the Exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians, 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Gal. 1:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016">16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007">Gal. 2:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009">9</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p26.1"></a>.)

 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p28"></a><b>9.</b> <i>What is the fellowship of the mystery.</i> The publication of the gospel is called a <i>fellowship,</i> because it is the will of God that his purpose, which had formerly been hidden, shall now be shared by men. There is an appropriate metaphor in the words φωτίσαι πάντας, <i>to</i> <i>enlighten all men,</i> — conveying the thought, that, in his apostleship, the grace of God shines with the brightness of noon-day.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p29"></a><i>Which hath been hid in God.</i> This is intended, as before, to obviate the prejudice of novelty, — to oppose the rashness of men, who think it improper that they should remain in ignorance of anything whatever. Who will question the right which God has to keep his own purposes concealed, until he shall be pleased to communicate them to men? What presumption, — yea, what madness is it, not to admit 		that God is wiser than we! Let us remember, therefore, that our rashness ought to receive a check, whenever the boundless height of the Divine foreknowledge is presented to our view. This, too, is the reason why he calls them <i>the unsearchable riches of Christ;</i> intimating that this subject, though it exceeds our capacity, ought to be contemplated with reverence and admiration.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p30"></a><i>Who created all things by Jesus Christ.</i> This cannot so properly be understood of the first creation as of the spiritual renewal. It is, no doubt, true, and is frequently declared in Scripture, that by the Word of God all things were created; but the connection of the passage lays us under the necessity of understanding by it that renewal which is comprehended in the blessing of redemption. But it 		may, perhaps, be thought that the apostle is illustrating this renewal, by an argument drawn from the creation. “By Christ, as God, the Father created (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003">Joh 1:3</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p30.1"></a>) all things; and why, then, should we wonder, if by Christ, as Mediator, all the Gentiles are now brought back to one body?” I have no objection to this view. A similar argument is used by him in another Epistle.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p31"></a>“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is the same who hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p31.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006">2Co 4:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p31.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p32"></a>From the creation of the world he concludes, that it is the work of God to enlighten the darkness; but what was visible in the former case is ascribed to the Spirit, when he comes to speak of the kingdom of Christ.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p34"></a><b>10.</b> <i>That now to the principalities and powers.</i> Some are of opinion that these words cannot apply to angels, because such ignorance, as is here supposed, could not be found in those who are permitted to behold the brightness of God’s countenance. They choose rather to refer them to devils, but without due reflection; for what could have been 		regarded as extraordinary in the assertion, that, by the preaching of the gospel and the calling of the Gentiles, information was, for the first time, conveyed to devils? There can be no doubt that the apostle labors to place in the strongest light the mercy of God toward the Gentiles, and the high value of the gospel. For this purpose he declares, that the preaching of the gospel exhibits the manifold grace of God, with which, till now, the heavenly angels themselves were unacquainted. The 		wisdom of God, therefore, which was manifested by uniting Jews and Gentiles in the fellowship of the gospel, ought to be regarded by men with the highest admiration.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p35"></a> He calls it πολυποίκιλον σοφίαν, <i>manifold wisdom,</i> because men are accustomed to try it by a false standard, confining their view to a particular department, and thus forming a most inadequate conception of the whole. The Jews thought, for example, that the dispensation under the law, with which they were acquainted and 		familiar, was the only form in which the wisdom of God could be seen. But, by making the gospel to be proclaimed to all men without exception, God has brought forth to view another instance and proof of his wisdom. Not that it was new wisdom, but that it was so large and <i>manifold,</i>   		 <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">132</font></a>
  		 as to transcend our limited capacity. Let us rest assured that the knowledge, whatever it may be, which we have acquired, is, after all, but a slender proportion. And if the calling of the Gentiles draws the attention, and excites the reverence, of angels in heaven, how shameful that it should be slighted or disdained by men upon earth!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p37"></a>The inference which some draw from this passage, that angels are present in our assemblies, and make progress along with ourselves in knowledge, is a groundless speculation. We must always keep in view the purposes for which God appointed the ministry of his word. If angels, who are permitted to see the face of God, do not walk in faith, neither do they need the outward administration of the word. The preaching of the gospel, therefore, 		is of no service but to human beings, among whom alone the practice exists. Paul’s meaning is this: “The church, composed both of Jews and Gentiles, is a mirror, in which angels behold the astonishing wisdom of God displayed in a manner unknown to them before. They see a work which is new to them, and the reason of which was hid in God. In this manner, and not by learning anything from the lips of men, do they make progress.”</p>

A third time, he repeats that the decree was eternal and unchangeable, but must be carried into effect by <i>Christ Jesus our Lord,</i> because in him it was made. Thus he 		declares, that the proper time for publishing this decree belongs to the kingdom of Christ. Literally the words run, “according to the eternal purpose (ἣν ἐποίησοεν) <i>which he</i> <i>made.</i>” But I consider the meaning to be, <i>which he purposed;</i> because the present discussion does not relate solely to the execution of the decree, but to the appointment itself, which, though it took place before all ages, was known to God only — till the manifestation of Christ.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Through whom we have boldness.</i> The honor of reconciling the Father to the whole world must be given to Christ. From the effects of this grace its excellence is demonstrated; for <i>faith,</i> which is possessed by Gentiles in common with Jews, admits them into the presence of God. When the words, 		<i>through Christ</i> and <i>by the faith of him,</i> are used by Paul, in connection with the name of God, there is always an implied contrast, which shuts up every other approach, — which excludes every other method of obtaining Divine fellowship. Most important and valuable instruction is here conveyed. The true nature and power of faith, and the confidence which is necessary for calling upon God, are 		beautifully expressed. That the consequences of faith, and the duties which it performs, should be the subject of much controversy between us and the Papists, is not surprising. They do not properly understand the meaning of the word <i>Faith,</i> which they might learn from this passage, if they were not blinded by prejudice.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p42"></a>First, Paul denominates it <i>the faith of Christ;</i> by which he intimates, that everything which faith ought to contemplate is exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows, that an empty and confused knowledge of Christ must not be mistaken for Faith, but that knowledge which is directed to Christ, in order to seek God in Christ; and this can only be done when the power and 		offices of Christ are understood.<i> Faith</i> produces<i> confidence, </i>which again, in its turn, produces <i>boldness.</i> There are three stages in our progress. First, we believe the promises of God; next, by relying on them, we obtain that <i>confidence,</i> which is accompanied by holiness and peace of mind; and, last 		of all, comes <i>boldness,</i> which enables us to banish fear, and to come with firmness and steadiness into the presence of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p43"></a>To separate <i>faith</i> from <i>confidence</i> would be an attempt to take away heat and light from the sun. I acknowledge, indeed, that, in proportion to the measure of faith, confidence is small in some and greater in others; but faith will never be found unaccompanied by these 		effects or fruits. A trembling, hesitating, doubting conscience, will always be a sure evidence of unbelief; but a firm, steady faith, will prove to be invincible against the gates of hell. To trust in Christ as Mediator, and to entertain a firm conviction of our heavenly Father’s love, — to venture boldly to promise to ourselves eternal life, and not to tremble at death or hell, — is, to use a common phrase, a holy presumption.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p44"></a>Observe the expression, <i>access with confidence.</i> Wicked men seek rest in forgetfulness of God, and are never at ease but when they remove to the greatest possible distance from God. His own children differ from them in this respect, that they “have peace with God,” 		(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p44.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Ro 5:1</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p44.1"></a>,) and approach to him with cheerfulness and delight. We infer, likewise, from this passage, that, in order to call on God in a proper manner, <i>confidence</i> is necessary, and thus becomes the key that opens to us the gate of heaven. Those who doubt and hesitate will never be heard.</p>

Let pastors learn from Paul’s example, not only to admonish and exhort their people, but to 		entreat the Lord to bless their labors, that they may not be unfruitful. Nothing will be gained by their industry and toil, — all their study and application will be to no purpose, except so far as the Lord bestows his blessing. This ought not to be regarded by them as an encouragement to sloth. It is their duty, on the contrary, to labor earnestly in sowing and watering, provided they, at the same time, ask and expect the increase from the Lord.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p17"></a>We are thus enabled to refute the slanders of the Pelagians and Papists, who argue, that, if the grace of the Holy Spirit performs the whole work of enlightening our minds, and forming our hearts to obedience, all instruction will be superfluous. The only effect of the enlightening and renewing influences of the Holy Spirit is, to give to instruction its proper weight and efficacy, that we may not be blind to the light of heaven, or deaf 		to the strains of truth. While the Lord alone acts upon us, he acts by his own instruments. It is therefore the duty of pastors diligently to teach, — of the people, earnestly to receive instruction, — and of both, not to weary themselves in unprofitable exertions, but to look up for Divine aid.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p18"></a><i>I bow my knees.</i> The bodily attitude is here put for the religious exercise itself.

  		 The relative, ἐξ οὗ, <i>of whom,</i> may apply equally to the Father and to the Son. Erasmus restricts it entirely to the Father. I do not approve of this; for readers ought to have been allowed a liberty of choice; nay, the other interpretation appears to be far more probable. The apostle alludes to that relationship which the Jews had with each other, through their 		father Abraham, to whom they trace their lineage. He proposes, on the contrary, to remove the distinction between Jews and Gentiles; and tells them, not only that all men have been brought into one family and one race through Christ, but that they are enabled to claim kindred even with angels.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p22"></a>To apply it to God the Father would not be equally defensible, being liable to this obvious exception, that God formerly passed by the Gentiles, and adopted the Jews as his peculiar people. But when we apply it to Christ, the whole of Paul’s statement agrees with the facts; for all come and blend together, as one family, and, related to one God the Father, are mutually brethren. Let us therefore understand that, through the mediation of 		Christ, a relationship has been constituted between Jews and Gentiles, because, by reconciling us to the Father, he has made us all one. Jews have no longer any reason to boast that they are the posterity of Abraham, or that they belong to this or that tribe, — to despise others as profane, and claim the exclusive honor of being a holy people. There is but one relationship which ought to be reckoned, both in heaven and on earth, both among angels and among men — a union to the body of Christ. 		Out of him all will be found scattered. He alone is the bond by which we are united.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p24"></a><b>16.</b> <i>That he would give to you.</i> Paul wishes that the Ephesians should be <i>strengthened;</i> and yet he had already bestowed on their piety no mean commendation. But believers have never advanced so far as not to need farther growth. The highest perfection of the godly in this life is an earnest desire 		to make progress. This <i>strengthening,</i> he tells us, is the work of the <i>Spirit;</i> so that it does not proceed from man’s own ability. The increase, as well as the commencement, of everything good in us, comes from the Holy Spirit. That it is the gift of Divine grace, is evident from the expression used, <i>that he would give to you</i>  This the Papists utterly deny. They maintain that the <i>second</i> grace is bestowed upon us, according as we have individually deserved it, by making a proper use of the <i>first</i> grace. But let us unite with Paul in acknowledging that it is the “gift” of the grace of God, not only that we have 		begun to run well, but that we advance; not only that we have been born again, but that we grow from day to day.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p25"></a><i>According to the riches of his glory.</i> These words are intended to express still more strongly the doctrine of Divine grace. They may be explained in two ways: either, <i>according to his glorious riches,</i> making the genitive, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, supply the place of an adjective, — or, <i>according to his rich and 		abundant glory.</i> The word <i>glory</i> will thus be put for <i>mercy,</i> in accordance with an expression which he had formerly used, “to the praise of the glory of his grace.” (<a name="iv.iv.iii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006">Eph 1:6</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p25.1"></a>) I prefer the latter view.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p26"></a><i>In the inner man.</i> By <i>the inner man,</i> Paul means the soul, and whatever relates to the spiritual life of the soul; as the <i>outward</i> man denotes the body, with everything that belongs to it, — health, honors, riches, vigor, beauty, and everything of that nature. “Though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by day;” that is, if in worldly matters we decay, our spiritual life becomes more and more vigorous. (<a name="iv.iv.iii-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016">2Co 4:16</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p26.1"></a>) The prayer of Paul, that the saints may be <i>strengthened,</i> does not mean that they 		may be eminent and flourishing in the world, but that, with respect to the kingdom of God, their minds may be made strong by Divine power.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p30"></a>so he who has Christ dwelling in him can want nothing. It is a mistake to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without obtaining Christ; and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can receive Christ without the Spirit. Both doctrines must be believed. We are partakers of the Holy Spirit, in proportion to the intercourse which we maintain with Christ; for the Spirit will be found nowhere but in Christ, on whom he is said, on 		that account, to have rested; for he himself says, by the prophet Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me.” (<a name="iv.iv.iii-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p30.1"></a>; <a name="iv.iv.iii-p30.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018">Lu 4:18</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p30.2"></a>.) But neither can Christ be separated from his Spirit; for then he would be said to be dead, and to have lost all his power.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p31"></a>Justly, therefore, does Paul affirm that the persons who are endowed by God with spiritual vigor are those in whom <i>Christ dwells.</i> He points to that part in which Christ peculiarly dwells,<i> in your hearts,</i> — to show that it is not enough if the knowledge of Christ dwell on the tongue or flutter in the brain.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p32"></a><i>May dwell through faith.</i> The method by which so great a benefit is obtained is also expressed. What a remarkable commendation is here bestowed on <i>faith,</i> that, by means of it, the Son of God becomes our own, and “makes his abode with us!” 		(<a name="iv.iv.iii-p32.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023">Joh 14:23</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p32.1"></a>.) By faith we not only acknowledge that Christ suffered and rose from the dead on our account, but, accepting the offers which he makes of himself, we possess and enjoy him as our Savior. This deserves our careful attention. Most people consider fellowship with Christ, and believing in Christ, to be the same thing; but the fellowship which we have 		with Christ is the consequence of faith. In a word, faith is not a distant view, but a warm embrace, of Christ, by which he dwells in us, and we are filled with the Divine Spirit.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p33"></a><i>That ye may be rooted and grounded in love.</i> Among the fruits of Christ’s dwelling in us the apostle enumerates love and gratitude for the Divine grace and kindness exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows, that this is true and solid excellence; so that, whenever he treats of the perfection of the saints, he views it as consisting of these two parts. The firmness and constancy which our love 		ought to possess are pointed out by two metaphors. There are many persons not wholly destitute of love; but it is easily removed or shaken, because its roots are not deep. Paul desires that it should be<i> rooted </i>  		 <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">136</font></a>
  		<i> and grounded,</i> — thoroughly fixed in our minds, so as to resemble a well-founded building or deeply-planted tree. The true meaning is, that our roots ought to be so deeply planted, and our foundation so firmly laid in love, that nothing will be able to shake us. It is idle to infer from these words, that love is the foundation and root of our salvation. Paul does not inquire here, as any one may perceive, on what our salvation is founded, 		but with what firmness and constancy we ought to continue in the exercise of love.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p36"></a><b>18.</b><i> May be able to comprehend.</i> The second fruit is, that the Ephesians should perceive the greatness of Christ’s love to men. Such an apprehension or knowledge springs from faith. By desiring that they should comprehend it <i>with all saints,</i> he shows that it is the most excellent blessing which they can obtain in the 		present life; that it is the highest wisdom, to which all the children of God aspire. What follows is sufficiently clear in itself, but has hitherto been darkened by a variety of interpretations. Augustine is quite delighted with his own acuteness, which throws no light on the subject. Endeavouring to discover some kind of mysterious allusion to the figure of the cross, he makes the <i>breadth</i> to be love, — the <i>height,</i> hope, — the <i>length,</i> patience, and the <i>depth,</i> humility. This is very ingenious and entertaining: but what has it to do with Paul’s meaning? Not more, certainly, than the opinion of Ambrose, that the allusion is to the figure of a sphere. Laying aside the views of others, I shall state what will be universally acknowledged to be 		the simple and true meaning.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.iii-p37"></a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p37.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p38"></a><b>19.</b> <i>And to know the love of Christ.</i> By those dimensions Paul means nothing else than the love of Christ, of which he speaks afterwards. The meaning is, that he who <i>knows</i> it fully and perfectly is in every respect a wise man. As if he had said, “In 		whatever direction men may look, they will find nothing in the doctrine of salvation that does not bear some relation to this subject.” The love of Christ contains within itself the whole of wisdom, so that the words may run thus: <i>that ye may be able to comprehend the love of Christ, which is the length and breadth, and depth, and height,</i> that is, the complete perfection of all wisdom. The 		metaphor is borrowed from mathematicians, taking the parts as expressive of the whole. Almost all men are infected with the disease of desiring to obtain useless knowledge. It is of great importance that we should be told what is necessary for us to know, and what the Lord desires us to contemplate, above and below, on the right hand and on the left, before and behind. The love of Christ is held out to us as the subject which ought to occupy our daily and nightly meditations, and in which we 		ought to be wholly plunged. He who is in possession of this alone has enough. Beyond it there is nothing solid, nothing useful, — nothing, in short, that is proper or sound. Though you survey the heaven and earth and sea, you will never go beyond this without overstepping the lawful boundary of wisdom.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p39"></a><i>Which surpasseth knowledge.</i> A similar expression occurs in another Epistle:</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.iii-p40"></a>“the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” <br> 		(<a name="iv.iv.iii-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007">Php 4:7</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p40.2"></a>)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p41"></a>No man can approach to God without being raised above himself and above the world. On this ground the sophists refuse to admit that we can know with certainty that we enjoy the grace of God; for they measure faith by the perception of the bodily senses. But Paul justly contends that this wisdom exceeds all knowledge; for, if the faculties of man could reach it, the prayer of Paul that God would bestow it must have been unnecessary. Let 		us remember, therefore, that the certainty of faith is knowledge, but is acquired by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, not by the acuteness of our own intellect. If the reader desire a more full discussion of this subject, he may consult the “Institutes of the Christian Religion.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p42"></a><i>That ye may be filled.</i> Paul now expresses in one word what he meant by the various dimensions. He who has Christ has everything necessary for being made perfect in God; for this is the meaning of the phrase,<i> the fullness of God.</i> Men do certainly imagine that they have entire completeness in themselves, but it is only when their pride is swelled 		with empty trifles. It is a foolish and wicked dream, that by <i>the fullness of God</i> is meant the full Godhead, as if men were raised to an equality with God.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.iv"></a>  	  		 		     		  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1"></a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020">Ephesians 3:20-21</a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p6"></a> </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iv.iv-p7"></a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p7.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p8"></a><b>20.</b> <i>Now to him.</i> He now breaks out into thanksgiving, which serves the additional purpose of exhorting the Ephesians to maintain “good hope through grace,” (<a name="iv.iv.iv-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016">2Th 2:16</a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p8.1"></a>,) and to endeavor constantly to obtain more and more adequate conceptions of the value of the grace of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p9"></a><i>Who is able. </i>  		 <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">137</font></a>
  		 This refers to the future, and agrees with what we are taught concerning hope; and indeed we cannot offer to God proper or sincere thanksgivings for favors received, unless we are convinced that his goodness to us will be without end. When he says that God is <i>able,</i> he does not mean power viewed apart, as the phrase is, from the act, but power which is exerted, and which we actually feel. 		Believers ought always to connect it with the work, when the promises made to them, and their own salvation, form the subject of inquiry. Whatever God can do, he unquestionably will do, if he has promised it. This the apostle proves both by former instances, and by the efficacy of the Spirit, which was at this very time exerted on their own minds.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p11"></a><i>According to the power that worketh in us,</i> — according to what we feel within ourselves; for every benefit which God bestows upon us is a manifestation of his grace, and love, and power, in consequence of which we ought to cherish a stronger confidence for the future<i>. Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,</i> is a remarkable expression, 		and bids us entertain no fear lest faith of a proper kind should go to excess. Whatever expectations we form of Divine blessings, the infinite goodness of God will exceed all our wishes and all our thoughts.</p>
