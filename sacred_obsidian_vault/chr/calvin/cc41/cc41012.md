 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 41: Galatians and Ephesians</i>, tr. by John King, [1847-50], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.i"></a>    
 <p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref08"><a name="iv.i-p1"></a>THE ARGUMENT</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p2"></a>Ephesus, which is familiarly known in history under a great variety of names,  	  <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
  	 was a very celebrated city of Lesser Asia. The remarkable events connected with the work of God in “forming there a people for himself,” (<a name="iv.i-p3.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021">Isa 43:21</a><a name="iv.i-p3.1"></a>,) through the labors of Paul, together with the commencement and progress of that church, are related by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. At present, I shall do nothing more than glance at what bears directly on the argument of the Epistle. The Ephesians 	 had been instructed by Paul in the pure doctrine of the gospel. At a later period, while he was a prisoner at Rome, and perceiving that they needed confirmation, he wrote to them, on that account, the present Epistle.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p4"></a>The first three chapters are chiefly occupied with commending the grace of God. Immediately after the salutation in the commencement of the first chapter, he treats of God’s free election. This affords him an opportunity of stating that they were now called into the kingdom of God, because they had been appointed to life before they were born. And here occurs a striking display of God’s wonderful mercy, when the salvation of men is traced to its 	 true and native source, the free act of adoption. But as the minds of men are ill fitted to receive so sublime a mystery, he betakes himself to prayer, that God would enlighten the Ephesians in the full knowledge of Christ.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p5"></a>In the second chapter, by drawing two comparisons, he places in a strong light the riches of divine grace. <b>1.</b> He reminds them how wretched they were before they were called to Christ. We never become duly sensible of our obligations to Christ, nor estimate aright his kindness towards us, till we have been led to view, on the other side, the unhappy condition in which we formerly were “without Christ.” (<a name="iv.i-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</a><a name="iv.i-p5.1"></a>.) <b>2.</b> The Gentiles were “aliens” from the promises of eternal life, which God had been pleased to bestow on the Jews alone.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p6"></a>In the third chapter, he declares that he had been appointed to be, in a peculiar manner, the Apostle of the Gentiles, because, for a long period, they were “strangers and foreigners,” (<a name="iv.i-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019">Eph 2:19</a><a name="iv.i-p6.1"></a>,) but are now included among the people of God. As this was an unusual event, and as its very novelty produced uneasiness in many minds, he calls it a</p>    
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.i-p7"></a>“mystery which in other ages was not made known<br> 	 to the sons of men,” (<a name="iv.i-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004">Eph. 3:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005">5</a><a name="iv.i-p7.2"></a>,)</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p8"></a>but “the dispensation” (<a name="iv.i-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002">Eph 3:2</a><a name="iv.i-p8.1"></a>) of which had been intrusted to himself.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p9"></a>Towards the close of the chapter, he again prays that God would grant to the Ephesians such an intimate knowledge of Christ, that they would have no desire to know anything else. His object in doing so is not merely to lead them to gratitude to God for so many favors, and to the expression of that gratitude by entire devotion to his service, but still more to remove all doubt about his own calling. Paul was probably afraid that the false 	 apostles would shake their faith by insinuating that they had been only half-instructed. They had been Gentiles, and, when they embraced pure Christianity, had been told nothing about ceremonies or circumcision. But all who enjoined on Christians the observance of the law were loud in the avowal, that those who have not been introduced into the church of God by circumcision must be held as profane persons. This was their ordinary song, that no man who is not circumcised is entitled to be 	 reckoned among the people of God, and that all the rites prescribed by Moses ought to be observed. Accordingly, they brought it as a charge against Paul, that he exhibited Christ as equally the Savior of Gentiles and of Jews. They asserted that his apostleship was a profanation of the heavenly doctrine, because it threw open to wicked men, without discrimination, a share in the covenant of grace.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p10"></a>That the Ephesians, when assailed by these calumnies, might not give way, he resolved to meet them. While he argues so earnestly that they were called to the gospel because they had been chosen before the creation of the world, he charges them, on the other hand, not to imagine that the gospel had been accidentally brought to them by the will of men, or that it flew to them by chance;  	  <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
  	 for the preaching of Christ among them was nothing else than the announcement of that eternal decree. While he lays before them the unhappy condition of their former life, he at the same time reminds them that the singular and astonishing mercy of God appeared in rescuing them from so deep a gulf. While he sets before their eyes his own commission as the apostle of the Gentiles, he confirms them in the faith which they had once received, because they had been divinely admitted into 	 the communion of the church. And yet each of the sentences to which we have now referred must be viewed as an exhortation fitted to excite the Ephesians to gratitude.</p>    
 <p><a name="iv.i-p12"></a>In the fourth chapter, he describes the manner in which the Lord governs and protects his church, which is, by the gospel preached by men. Hence it follows, that in no other way can its integrity be preserved, and that the object at which it aims is true perfection. The apostle’s design is, to commend to the Ephesians the ministry by which God reigns amongst us. He afterwards details the fruits of this preaching, — a holy life and all the 	 duties of piety. Nor does he satisfy himself with describing in general terms how Christians ought to live, but lays down particular exhortations adapted to the various relations of society.</p>
