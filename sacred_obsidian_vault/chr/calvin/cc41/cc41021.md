 <p><a name="v.ii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Next, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem along with Barnabas, having taken Titus also.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>And I went up according to revelation,   	  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  	  and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles; but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p6"></a><b>3 </b>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p7"></a><b>4 </b>On account of false brethren, who had secretly entered in order to spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might; bring us into bondage;</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p8"></a><b>5 </b>To whom we gave place by subjection, not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p9"></a><b>6 </b>But of those who appeared to be something, whatsoever they formerly were, it is of no consequence to me; (God accepteth no man’s person, <a name="v.ii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017">De 10:17</a><a name="v.ii-p9.1"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007">2Ch 19:7</a><a name="v.ii-p9.2"></a>; 	 <a name="v.ii-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019">Job 34:19</a><a name="v.ii-p9.3"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/wis006.htm#008">Wisdom 6:8</a><a name="v.ii-p9.4"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/sir035.htm#016">Ecclesiasticus 35:16</a><a name="v.ii-p9.5"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034">Ac 10:34</a><a name="v.ii-p9.6"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011">Ro 2:11</a><a name="v.ii-p9.7"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009">Eph 6:9</a><a name="v.ii-p9.8"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025">Col 3:25</a><a name="v.ii-p9.9"></a>; <a name="v.ii-p9.10"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017">1Pe 1:17</a><a name="v.ii-p9.10"></a>;) for they who appeared to be in estimation communicated nothing to me;</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p10"></a><b>7 </b>But, on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was communicated to me, as that of the circumcision (was) to Peter;</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p11"></a><b>8 </b>(For he who was effectual in Peter in order to the apostleship of circumcision, was also effectual in me towards the Gentiles;)</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p12"></a><b>9 </b>And James, and Cephas, and John, (who seethed to be pillars,) having known the grace given to me, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we might discharge the apostleship among the Gentiles, and they among the circumcision.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p13"></a><b>10 </b>Only that we should be mindful of the poor, which I also was careful to do.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p14"></a><b>11 </b>And when Peter was come to Antioch, I openly withstood him, because he was worthy of blame.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p15"></a><b>12 </b>For before that certain persons came from James, he partook of food along with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself from them, dreading those who were of the circumcision.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p16"></a><b>13 </b>And the other Jews also dissembled along with him, so that Barnabas also was led aside into their dissimulation.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p17"></a><b>14 </b>But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all ‘If thou, being a Jew, livest like Gentiles, and not like Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live like Jews?</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p18"></a><b>15 </b>We, (who are) Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p19"></a><b>16 </b>Knowing that man is not justified by works of the law, but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the that; for by works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p20"></a><b>17 </b>But if, seeking to be justified in Christ, We ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin? By no means.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p21"></a><b>18 </b>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p22"></a><b>19 </b>For by the law I am dead to the law. That I might live to God,</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p23"></a><b>20 </b>I am crucified with Christ.   	  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  	  Now it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me; and that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>    
 <p><a name="v.ii-p25"></a><b>21 </b>I do not set aside the grace of God; for, if righteousness is by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p>
