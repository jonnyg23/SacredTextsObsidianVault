 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxxi"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxi-p0.1"></a>31. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxxi-p1"></a>Hence it is perfectly clear that neither words nor singing (if used  in prayer) are of the least consequence, or avail one iota with God, unless they  proceed from deep feeling in the heart. Nay, rather they provoke his anger  against us, if they come from the lips and throat only, since this is to abuse  his sacred name, and hold his majesty in derision. This we infer from the words  of Isaiah, which, though their meaning is of wider extent, go to rebuke this  vice also: "Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with  their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their  fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will  proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a  wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of  their prudent men shall be hid" (<a name="iii.xxxi-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013">Isaiah 29:13</a><a name="iii.xxxi-p1.1"></a>). Still we do not condemn words or  singing, but rather greatly commend them, provided the feeling of the mind goes  along with them. For in this way the thought of God is kept alive on our minds,  which, from their fickle and versatile nature, soon relax, and are distracted by  various objects, unless various means are used to support them. Besides, since  the glory of God ought in a manner to be displayed in each part of our body, the  special service to which the tongue should be devoted is that of singing and  speaking, inasmuch as it has been expressly created to declare and proclaim the  praise of God. This employment of the tongue is chiefly in the public services  which are performed in the meeting of the saints. In this way the God whom we  serve in one spirit and one faith, we glorify together as it were with one voice  and one mouth; and that openly, so that each may in turn receive the confession  of his brother's faith, and be invited and incited to imitate it.</p>
