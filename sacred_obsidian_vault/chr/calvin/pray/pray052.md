 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.l"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.l-p0.1"></a>50. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.l-p1"></a>But although it has been said above (sec. 7, 27, &amp;c.), that we  ought always to raise our minds upwards towards God, and pray without ceasing,  yet such is our weakness, which requires to be supported, such our torpor, which  requires to be stimulated, that it is requisite for us to appoint special hours  for this exercise, hours which are not to pass away without prayer, and during  which the whole affections of our minds are to be completely occupied; namely,  when we rise in the morning, before we commence our daily work, when we sit down  to food, when by the blessing of God we have taken it, and when we retire to  rest. This, however, must not be a superstitious observance of hours, by which,  as it were, performing a task to God, we think we are discharged as to other  hours; it should rather be considered as a discipline by which our weakness is  exercised, and ever and anon stimulated. In particular, it must be our anxious  care, whenever we are ourselves pressed, or see others pressed by any strait,  instantly to have recourse to him not only with quickened pace, but with  quickened minds; and again, we must not in any prosperity of ourselves or others  omit to testify our recognition of his hand by praise and thanksgiving. Lastly,  we must in all our prayers carefully avoid wishing to confine God to certain  circumstances, or prescribe to him the time, place, or mode of action. In like  manner, we are taught by this prayer not to fix any law or impose any condition  upon him, but leave it entirely to him to adopt whatever course of procedure  seems to him best, in respect of method, time, and place. For before we offer up  any petition for ourselves, we ask that his will may be done, and by so doing  place our will in subordination to his, just as if we had laid a curb upon it,  that, instead of presuming to give law to God, it may regard him as the ruler  and disposer of all its wishes.</p>
