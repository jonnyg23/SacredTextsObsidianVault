 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxv"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxv-p0.1"></a>25. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxv-p1"></a>The other passages of Scripture which they employ to defend their  error are miserably wrested. Jacob (they say) asks for the sons of Joseph, "Let  my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac"  (<a name="iii.xxv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016">Genesis 48:16</a><a name="iii.xxv-p1.1"></a>). First, let us see what the nature of this invocation was among the  Israelites. They do not implore their fathers to bring succour to them, but they  beseech God to remember his servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Their example,  therefore, gives no countenance to those who use addresses to the saints  themselves. But such being the dulness of these blocks, that they comprehend not  what it is to invoke the name of Jacob, nor why it is to be invoked, it is not  strange that they blunder thus childishly as to the mode of doing it. The  expression repeatedly occurs in Scripture. Isaiah speaks of women being called  by the name of men, when they have them for husbands and live under their  protection (<a name="iii.xxv-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isaiah 4:1</a><a name="iii.xxv-p1.2"></a>). The calling of the name of Abraham over the Israelites  consists in referring the origin of their race to him, and holding him in  distinguished remembrance as their author and parent. Jacob does not do so from  any anxiety to extend the celebrity of his name, but because he knows that all  the happiness of his posterity consisted in the inheritance of the covenant  which God had made with them. Seeing that this would give them the sum of all  blessings, he prays that they may be regarded as of his race, this being nothing  else than to transmit the succession of the covenant to them. They again, when  they make mention of this subject in their prayers, do not betake themselves to  the intercession of the dead, but call to remembrance that covenant in which  their most merciful Father undertakes to be kind and propitious to them for the  sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How little, in other respects, the saints  trusted to the merits of their fathers, the public voice of the Church declares  in the prophets "Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of  us, and Israel acknowledge us not; thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer"  (<a name="iii.xxv-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016">Isaiah 63:16</a><a name="iii.xxv-p1.3"></a>). And while the Church thus speaks, she at the same time adds,  " Return for thy servants' sake," not thinking of anything like intercession, but  adverting only to the benefit of the covenant. Now, indeed, when we have the  Lord Jesus, in whose hand the eternal covenant of mercy was not only made but  confirmed, what better name can we bear before us in our prayers? And since  those good Doctors would make out by these words that the Patriarchs are  intercessors, I should like them to tell me why, in so great a multitude, <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">12</font></a>
  no place  whatever is given to Abraham, the father of the Church? We know well from what a  crew they select their intercessors. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">13</font></a>
  Let them  then tell me what consistency there is in neglecting and rejecting Abraham, whom  God preferred to all others, and raised to the highest degree of honour. The  only reason is, that as it was plain there was no such practice in the ancient  Church, they thought proper to conceal the novelty of the practice by saying  nothing of the Patriarchs: as if by a mere diversity of names they could excuse  a practice at once novel and impure. They sometimes, also, object that God is  entreated to have mercy on his people "for David's sake" (<a name="iii.xxv-p1.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010">Psalm 132:10</a><a name="iii.xxv-p1.8"></a>; see Calv.  Com.). This is so far from supporting their error, that it is the strongest  refutation of it. We must consider the character which David bore. He is set  apart from the whole body of the faithful to establish the covenant which God  made in his hand. Thus regard is had to the covenant rather than to the  individual. Under him as a type the sole intercession of Christ is asserted. But  what was peculiar to David as a type of Christ is certainly inapplicable to  others.</p>
