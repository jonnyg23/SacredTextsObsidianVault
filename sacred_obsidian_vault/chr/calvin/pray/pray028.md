 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxvi"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxvi-p0.1"></a>26. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxvi-p1"></a>But some seem to be moved by the fact, that the prayers of saints  are often said to have been heard. Why? Because they prayed. "They cried unto  thee" (says the Psalmist), "and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were  not confounded" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005">Psalm 22:5</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.1"></a>). Let us also pray after their example, that like them  we too may be heard. Those men, on the contrary, absurdly argue that none will  be heard but those who have been heard already. How much better does James  argue, "Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed  earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of  three years and six months. And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain, and  the earth brought forth her fruit" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017">Jas. 5:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#018">18</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.2"></a>). What? Does he infer that  Elias possessed some peculiar privilege, and that we must have recourse to him  for the use of it? By no means. He shows the perpetual efficacy of a pure and  pious prayer, that we may be induced in like manner to pray. For the kindness  and readiness of God to hear others is malignantly interpreted, if their example  does not inspire us with stronger confidence in his promise, since his  declaration is not that he will incline his ear to one or two, or a few  individuals, but to all who call upon his name. In this ignorance they are the  less excusable, because they seem as it were avowedly to contemn the many  admonitions of Scripture. David was repeatedly delivered by the power of God.  Was this to give that power to him that we might be delivered on his  application? Very different is his affirmation: "The righteous shall compass me  about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007">Psalm 142:7</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.3"></a>). Again, "The  righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006">Psalm 52:6</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.4"></a>). "This  poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles"  (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006">Psalm 34:6</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.5"></a>). In The Psalms are many similar prayers, in which David calls upon  God to give him what he asks, for this reason, viz., that the righteous may not  be put to shame, but by his example encouraged to hope. Here let one passage  suffice, "For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when  thou mayest be found" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006">Psalm 32:6</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.6"></a>, Calv. Com.). This passage I have quoted the  more readily, because those ravers who employ their hireling tongues in defense  of the Papacy, are not ashamed to adduce it in proof of the intercession of the  dead. As if David intended anything more than to show the benefit which he shall  obtain from the divine clemency and condescension when he shall have been heard.  In general, we must hold that the experience of the grace of God, as well  towards ourselves as towards others, tends in no slight degree to confirm our  faith in his promises. I do not quote the many passages in which David sets  forth the loving-kindness of God to him as a ground of confidence, as they will  readily occur to every reader of The Psalms. Jacob had previously taught the  same thing by his own example, "I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies,  and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant: for with my staff  I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010">Genesis 32:10</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.7"></a>). He  indeed alleges the promise, but not the promise only; for he at the same time  adds the effect, to animate him with greater confidence in the future kindness  of God. God is not like men who grow weary of their liberality, or whose means  of exercising it become exhausted; but he is to be estimated by his own nature,  as David properly does when he says, "Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of  truth" (<a name="iii.xxvi-p1.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005">Psalm 31:5</a><a name="iii.xxvi-p1.8"></a>). After ascribing the praise of his salvation to God, he adds  that he is true: for were he not ever like himself, his past favour would not be  an infallible ground for confidence and prayer. But when we know that as often  as he assists us, he gives us a specimen and proof of his goodness and  faithfulness, there is no reason to fear that our hope will be ashamed or  frustrated.</p>
