 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.ii"></a>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii-p0.1"></a>2.</h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.ii-p1"></a>To <i>prayer</i>, then, are we indebted for penetrating to those  riches which are treasured up for us with our heavenly Father. For there is a  kind of intercourse between God and men, by which, having entered the upper  sanctuary, they appear before Him and appeal to his promises, that when  necessity requires they may learn by experiences that what they believed merely  on the authority of his word was not in vain. Accordingly, we see that nothing  is set before us as an object of expectation from the Lord which we are not  enjoined to ask of Him in prayer, so true it is that prayer digs up those  treasures which the Gospel of our Lord discovers to the eye of faith. The  necessity and utility of this exercise of prayer no words can sufficiently  express. Assuredly it is not without cause our heavenly Father declares that our  only safety is in calling upon his name, since by it we invoke the presence of  his providence to watch over our interests, of his power to sustain us when weak  and almost fainting, of his goodness to receive us into favour, though miserably  loaded with sin; in fine, call upon him to manifest himself to us in all his  perfections. Hence, admirable peace and tranquillity are given to our  consciences; for the straits by which we were pressed being laid before the  Lord, we rest fully satisfied with the assurance that none of our evils are  unknown to him, and that he is both able and willing to make the best provision  for us.</p>
