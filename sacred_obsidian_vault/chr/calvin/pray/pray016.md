 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xiv"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xiv-p0.1"></a>14. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xiv-p1"></a>It is strange that these delightful promises affect us coldly, or  scarcely at all, so that the generality of men prefer to wander up and down,  forsaking the fountain of living waters, and hewing out to themselves broken  cisterns, rather than embrace the divine liberality voluntarily offered to them  (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jeremiah 2:13</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.1"></a>). "The name of the Lord," says Solomon, "is a strong tower; the  righteous runneth into it, and is safe." (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010">Proverbs 18:10</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.2"></a>) Joel, after predicting the  fearful disaster which was at hand, subjoins the following memorable sentence:  " And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord  shall be delivered." (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032">Joel 2:32</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.3"></a>) This we know properly refers to the course of  the Gospel. Scarcely one in a hundred is moved to come into the presence of God,  though he himself exclaims by Isaiah, "And it shall come to pass, that before  they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear." (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024">Isaiah 65:24</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.4"></a>) This honour he elsewhere bestows upon the whole Church in general, as  belonging to all the members of Christ: "He shall call upon me, and I will  answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him."  (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015">Psalm 91:15</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.5"></a>) My intention, however, as I already observed, is not to enumerate  all, but only select some admirable passages as a specimen how kindly God  allures us to himself, and how extreme our ingratitude must be when with such  powerful motives our sluggishness still retards us. Wherefore, let these words  always resound in our ears: "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him,  to all that call upon him in truth" (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018">Psalm 145:18</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.6"></a>). Likewise those passages which  we have quoted from Isaiah and Joel, in which God declares that his ear is open  to our prayers, and that he is delighted as with a sacrifice of sweet savour  when we cast our cares upon him. The special benefit of these promises we  receive when we frame our prayer, not timorously or doubtingly, but when  trusting to his word whose majesty might otherwise deter us, we are bold to call  him Father, he himself deigning to suggest this most delightful name. Fortified  by such invitations it remains for us to know that we have therein sufficient  materials for prayer, since our prayers depend on no merit of our own, but all  their worth and hope of success are founded and depend on the promises of God,  so that they need no other support, and require not to look up and down on this  hand and on that. It must therefore be fixed in our minds, that though we equal  not the lauded sanctity of patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, yet as the  command to pray is common to us as well as them, and faith is common, so if we  lean on the word of God, we are in respect of this privilege their associates.  For God declaring, as has already been seen, that he will listen and be  favourable to all, encourages the most wretched to hope that they shall obtain  what they ask; and, accordingly, we should attend to the general forms of  expression, which, as it is commonly expressed, exclude none from first to last;  only let there be sincerity of heart, self-dissatisfaction, humility, and faith,  that we may not, by the hypocrisy of a deceitful prayer, profane the name of  God. Our most merciful Father will not reject those whom he not only encourages  to come, but urges in every possible way. Hence David's method of prayer to  which I lately referred: "And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words  be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant, that it may  continue for ever before thee" (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#028">2 Samuel 7:28</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.7"></a>). So also, in another passage, "Let,  I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto  thy servant" (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076">Psalm 119:76</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.8"></a>). And the whole body of the Israelites, whenever they  fortify themselves with the remembrance of the covenant, plainly declare, that  since God thus prescribes they are not to pray timorously (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013">Genesis 32:13</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.9"></a>). In this  they imitated the example of the patriarchs, particularly Jacob, who, after  confessing that he was unworthy of the many mercies which he had received of the  Lord's hand, says, that he is encouraged to make still larger requests, because  God had promised that he would grant them. But whatever be the pretexts which  unbelievers employ, when they do not flee to God as often as necessity urges,  nor seek after him, nor implore his aid, they defraud him of his due honour just  as much as if they were fabricating to themselves new gods and idols, since in  this way they deny that God is the author of all their blessings. On the  contrary, nothing more effectually frees pious minds from every doubt, than to  be armed with the thought that no obstacle should impede them while they are  obeying the command of God, who declares that nothing is more grateful to him  than obedience. Hence, again, what I have previously said becomes still more  clear, namely, that a bold spirit in prayer well accords with fear, reverence,  and anxiety, and that there is no inconsistency when God raises up those who had  fallen prostrate. In this way forms of expression apparently inconsistent  admirably harmonize. Jeremiah and David speak of humbly laying their  supplications <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">5</font></a>
  before God  (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.13"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009">Jeremiah 42:9;</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.13"></a> <a name="iii.xiv-p1.14"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018">Daniel 9:18</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.14"></a>). In another passage Jeremiah says "Let, we beseech thee,  our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord thy God,  even for all this remnant" (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.15"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002">Jeremiah 42:2</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.15"></a>). On the other hand, believers are often  said to <i>lift up prayer</i>. Thus Hezekiah speaks, when asking the prophet to  undertake the office of interceding (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.16"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004">2 Kings 19:4</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.16"></a>). And David says, "Let my  prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as  the evening sacrifice" (<a name="iii.xiv-p1.17"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Ps. 141:2</a><a name="iii.xiv-p1.17"></a>). The explanation is, that though believers,  persuaded of the paternal love of God, cheerfully rely on his faithfulness, and  have no hesitation in imploring the aid which he voluntarily offers, they are  not elated with supine or presumptuous security; but climbing up by the ladder  of the promises, still remain humble and abased suppliants.</p>
