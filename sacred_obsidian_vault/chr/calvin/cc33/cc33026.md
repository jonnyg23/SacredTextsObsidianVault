 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p5"></a><b>14.</b> Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <b>15.</b> And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you?

 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p11"></a><b><a name="ii.xxv-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014">Matthew 26:14</a><a name="ii.xxv-p11.2"></a>.</b> <i>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot. </i>Christ’s admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening the heart of <i>Judas, </i>or producing any change in it for the better, that he immediately went 			 away, without any concern, to transact an infamous bargain with his enemies. It was amazing and prodigious stupidity, that he considered himself to have found, in the expense of the ointment, a fair excuse for so heinous a crime; and next, that, after having been warned by the words of Christ, he did not perceive what he was doing.   			  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  			  The bare mention of the <i>burying </i>ought to have softened a heart of iron; for it would have been easy to infer from it, that Christ offered himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of the human race. But we see in this mirror how great is the blindness of wicked desires, and how powerfully they fascinate the mind. <i>Judas </i>was inflamed with the 			 desire to steal; long practice had hardened him in wickedness; and now when he meets with no other prey, he does not scruple to betray basely to death the Son of God, the Author of life, and, though restrained by a holy admonition, rushes violently forward.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p13"></a>With good reason, therefore, does Luke expressly say that <i>Satan entered into him; </i>not that the Spirit of God formerly directed him, for he would not have been addicted to theft and robbery, if he had not been the slave of Satan. But Luke means, that he was at that time wholly given up to <i>Satan, </i>so that, like a desperate man, he violently sought his destruction. For though <i>Satan </i>drives us every day to crimes, and reigns in us, when he hurries us into a course of extraordinary wickedness; yet he is said to <i>enter </i>into the reprobate, when he takes possession of all their senses, overthrows the fear of God, extinguishes the light of reason, and destroys every feeling of shame. 			 This extremity of vengeance God does not execute on any but those who are already devoted to destruction. Let us therefore learn to repent early, lest our long-continued harshness should confirm the reign of Satan within us; for as soon as we have been abandoned to this tyranny, his rage will have no bounds. It is particularly worthy of notice, that the cause and source of so great blindness in <i>Judas </i>was avarice, which makes it evident that it 			 is justly denominated by Paul <i>the root of all evils, </i>(<a name="ii.xxv-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010">1Ti 6:10</a><a name="ii.xxv-p13.1"></a>.) To inquire here whether or not <i>Satan entered into Judas </i>bodily is an idle speculation. We ought rather to 			 consider how fearfully monstrous it is, that men formed after the image of God, and appointed to be temples for the Holy Spirit, should not only be turned into filthy stables or sinks, but should become the wretched abodes of Satan.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p15"></a><b>17.</b> <i>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus. </i>It is first inquired, Why does the day which preceded the sacrificing of the lamb receive the name of <i>the day of unleavened bread? </i>For the Law did not forbid 			 the use of leaven till the lamb was eaten, (<a name="ii.xxv-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#018">Ex 12:18</a><a name="ii.xxv-p15.2"></a>.) But this difficulty may be speedily removed, for the phrase refers to the following day, as is sufficiently evident from Mark and Luke. Since, therefore, the day of killing and eating the passover was at hand, the disciples ask Christ where <i>he wishes them to eat the passover.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p16"></a>But hence arises a more difficult question. How did Christ observe that ceremony on the day before the whole nation celebrated the public passover? For John plainly affirms that the day on which Christ was crucified was, among the Jews, <i>the preparation, </i>not of the Sabbath, but of <i>the passover, </i>(<a name="ii.xxv-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014">Joh 19:14</a><a name="ii.xxv-p16.1"></a>;) and that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.xxv-p17"></a>they did not enter into the hall of judgment, lest they should be defiled, because next day they were to eat the passover,<br> 			 (<a name="ii.xxv-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028">Joh 18:28</a><a name="ii.xxv-p17.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p18"></a>I am aware that there are some who resort to evasions, which do not, however, give them any relief; for no sophistry can set aside the fact; that, on the day they crucified Christ, they did not keep the feast, (when it would not have been lawful to have any public executions) and that they had, at that the a solemn <i>preparation, </i>so that 			 they ate the passover after that Christ had been buried.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p19"></a>It comes now to be inquired, Why did Christ anticipate? For it must not be supposed that, in this ceremony, he took any liberty which was at variance with the prescriptions of the Law. As to the notion entertained by some, that the Jews, through their eagerness to put Christ to death, delayed the passover, it is ably refuted by <i>Bucer, 			 </i>and, indeed, falls to the ground by its own absurdity. I have no doubt, therefore, that Christ observed the day appointed by the Law, and that the Jews followed a custom which had been long in use. First, it is beyond a doubt that Christ was put to death on the day before the Sabbath; for he was hastily buried before sunset in <i>a sepulcher which was at hand, 			 </i>(<a name="ii.xxv-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#042">Joh 19:42</a><a name="ii.xxv-p19.1"></a>,) because it was necessary to abstain from work after the commencement of the evening. Now it is universally admitted that, by an ancient custom, when <i>the passover </i>and other festivals happened on Friday, they were delayed till the following day, 			 because the people would have reckoned it hard to abstain from work on two successive days. The Jews maintain that this law was laid down immediately after the return of the people from the Babylonish captivity, and that it was done by a revelation from heaven, that they may not be thought to have made any change, of their own accord, in the commandments of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p20"></a>Now if it was the custom, at that time, to join two festivals in <i>one, </i>(as the Jews themselves admit, and as their ancient writings prove,) it is a highly probable conjecture that Christ, who celebrated the passover on the day before the Sabbath, observed the day prescribed by the Law; for we know how careful he was not to depart from a 			 single iota of the Law. Having determined to be subject to the Law, that he might deliver us from its yoke, he did not forget this subjection at his latest hour; and therefore he would rather have chosen to omit an outward ceremony, than to transgress the ordinance which God had appointed, and thus lay himself open to the slanders of wicked men. Even the Jews themselves unquestionably will not deny that, whenever the Sabbath immediately followed the passover, it was on one day, instead of both, 			 that they abstained from work, and that this was enjoined by the Rabbins. Hence it follows that Christ, in departing from the ordinary custom, attempted nothing contrary to the Law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p21"></a><a name="ii.xxv-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p22"></a><b>18.</b> <i>Go into the city to such a man. </i>Matthew specifies a certain man; the other two Evangelists relate that <i>the disciples 			 </i>were sent as to an unknown individual, because a sign was given to them of a man <i>carrying a pitcher of water. </i>But this difference is easily reconciled; for Matthew passing by the miracle, describes that man who was then unknown to the disciples; for it cannot be doubted that, when they came to the house, they found that it was one of their acquaintances. Christ enjoins 			 him authoritatively to make ready a lodging for himself and his disciples, calling him <i>master; </i>and the man immediately complies But though he might have expressly pointed out the man by name, he chose rather to direct his disciples to him by a miracle, that, when they shortly afterwards saw him reduced to a state of weakness, their faith might remain firm, being supported by this evidence. It was no slight confirmation that, a few hours before 			 he was put to death, he had given an undoubted proof that he was God, that they might know that he was not constrained by necessity, but yielded of his own accord. And though at the very time when the weariness occurred, this was perhaps of no advantage to them, yet the recollection of it was afterwards useful; as even in the present day, in order to rise above the offense of the cross, it is of great importance to us to know that, along with the weakness of the flesh, the glory of divinity 			 appeared in Christ about the very time of his death.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p23"></a><i>My time is near. </i>Though he celebrated <i>the passover </i>correctly according to the injunction of the Law, yet he appears to assign this reason for the express purpose of avoiding the blame of self-will. He says, therefore, that there are reasons why he must make haste, and not comply with a received custom, because 			 he is called to a greater sacrifice. And yet, as we have said, he introduces no change in the ceremony, but repeats once and again, that <i>the time </i>of his death <i>is near, </i>in order to inform them that he hastens cheerfully to do what the Father had appointed. And as to his connecting the figure of the sacrifice with the reality, in this way he exhorted believers to compare with the ancient figures 			 what he accomplished in reality. This comparison is highly fitted to illustrate the power and efficacy of his death; for <i>the passover </i>was enjoined on the Jews, not merely to remind them of an ancient deliverance, but also that they might expect future and more excellent deliverance from Christ. Such is the import of what Paul says, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.xxv-p24"></a>Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, (<a name="ii.xxv-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007">1Co 5:7</a><a name="ii.xxv-p24.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p25"></a><a name="ii.xxv-p25.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p26"></a><b>19.</b> <i>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them. </i>The readiness with which the disciples comply ought to be observed as a proof of their holy submission; for a doubt might naturally arise, when in search of an unknown man, whether they would obtain from <i>the master of the house </i>what they asked by their Master’s command, while they were aware that everywhere he was not only despised but even hated. Yet they make no anxious inquiry about the result, but peaceably obey the injunction. And if we are desirous to have our faith approved, we ought to abide by this rule, to be satisfied with the command alone and go forward wherever God commands, and, expecting the success which 			 he promises, not to indulge in excessive anxiety.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p27"></a><a name="ii.xxv-p27.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p28"></a><b>20.</b><i> When the evening was come, he sat down at table. </i>Not to eat <i>the passover, </i>which they were bound to do standing, as travelers, when they are in haste, are wont to take food hastily,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.xxv-p29"></a>with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hand,<br> 			 (<a name="ii.xxv-p29.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011">Ex 12:11</a><a name="ii.xxv-p29.2"></a>;)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxv-p30"></a>but I consider the meaning to be, that after having observed the solemn rite, he <i>sat down at table </i>to supper. Accordingly, the Evangelists say, <i>when the evening was come: </i>for, at the commencement of the evening, they killed the lamb, and ate the flesh of it roasted.</p>
