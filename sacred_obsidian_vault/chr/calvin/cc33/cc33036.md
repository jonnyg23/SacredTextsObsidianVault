 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p11"></a>Peter’s fall, which is here related, is a bright mirror of our weakness. In his repentance, also, a striking instance of the goodness and mercy of God is held out to us. This narrative, therefore, which relates to a single individual, contains a doctrine which may be applied to the whole Church, and which indeed is highly useful, both to instruct those who are standing to cherish anxiety and fear, and to comfort those who 			 have fallen, by holding out to them the hope of pardon. And first it ought to be <i>observed, </i>that Peter acted inconsiderately, when he entered into the hall of the high priest. It was his duty, no doubt, to follow his Master; but having been warned that he would revolt, he ought rather to have concealed himself in some corner, so as not to expose himself to an occasion of sinning. Thus it frequently 			 happens that believers, under an appearance of virtue, throw themselves within the reach of temptation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p12"></a>It is therefore our duty to pray to the Lord to restrain and keep us by his Spirit, lest, going beyond our measure, we be immediately punished. We ought also to pray, whenever we commence any undertaking, that he may not permit us to fail in the midst of our efforts, or at the beginning of the work, but may supply us with strength from heaven till the end. Conviction of our weakness ought not, indeed, to be a reason for indolence, to prevent 			 us from going wherever God calls us; but it ought to restrain our rashness, that we may not attempt any thing beyond our calling; and it ought also to stimulate us to prayer, that God, who has given us grace to begin well, may also continue to give us grace to persevere.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p13"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p14"></a><b><a name="ii.xxxv-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069">Matthew 26:69</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p14.2"></a>.</b> <i>A maid came to him. </i>Here we see that there is no necessity for a severe contest, or for many forces or implements of war, to overpower a man; for any man, who is not supported by the hand of God, will instantly fall by a slight gale or the rustling of a falling leaf. 			 Peter undoubtedly was not less courageous than any of us, and he had already given no ordinary proof of his valor, though it was exercised in a rash and improper manner; and yet he does not wait until he is dragged before the tribunal of the high priest, or until his enemies attempt to put him to death by violence, but, terrified by a woman’s voice, immediately denies his Master. And yet but lately he thought himself a valiant soldier even to death. Let us therefore remember that our strength 			 is so far from being sufficient to resist powerful attacks, that it will give way, when there is the mere shadow of a battle. But in this way God gives us the just reward of our treachery, when he disarms and strips us of all power, so that, when we have thrown off the fear of him, we tremble for a mere nothing. For if a deep fear of God had dwelt in Peter’s heart, it would have been an invincible fortress; but now, naked and defenseless, he trembles while he is still far from 			 danger.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p15"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p16"></a><b>70.</b> <i>But he denied before them all. </i>This circumstance aggravates the criminality of Peter, that, in denying his Master, he did not even dread a multitude of witnesses.   			  <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">236</font></a>
  			  And the Spirit intended expressly to state this, that even the presence of men may excite us to hold fast the confession of faith. For if we deny Christ before the weak, they are shaken by our example, and give way; and thus we destroy as many souls as we can; but if, in presence of those who wickedly despise God and oppose the Gospel, we withhold from Christ the testimony which is due to him, we expose his sacred name to the ridicule of all. In short, as a bold and 			 open confession edifies all the godly,   			  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">237</font></a>
  			  and puts unbelievers to shame, so apostasy draws along with it the public ruin of faith in the Church, and the reproach of sound doctrine. The more eminent a man is, therefore, he ought to be the more careful to be on his guard; for his elevation makes it impossible for him to fall from it without doing greater harm.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p19"></a><i>I know not what thou sayest. </i>The form of denial, which is here set down, shows sufficiently that the wretched sophists, who endeavor to escape by ambiguous expressions, which they turn to a. variety of meanings, when they are called to give an account of their faith, gain nothing by their dexterity in fraud. <i>Peter </i>does not absolutely <i>deny </i>the whole doctrine of the Gospel; he only <i>denies </i>that he <i>knew the man; </i>but, because in the person of Christ he indirectly buries the light of 			 the promised redemption, he is charged with base and shameful treachery. But lately he had heard from the mouth of the Lord, that the confession of faith is a sacrifice acceptable to God; and therefore a mode of <i>denying, </i>which withholds from God his lawful worship, and from Christ the honor that is due to him, admits of no excuse. Let us therefore hold:, that as soon as we depart from a plain and candid 			 profession of Christ, we deprive him of the testimony to which he has a lawful claim.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p20"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p21"></a><b>71.</b> <i>Another maid saw him. </i>From the words of Mark we are rather led to conjecture that it was the same <i>maid; </i>at least he doesn’t state that it was a different maid from the former one. But 			 there is no contradiction here; for it is probable that the statement which proceeded from one maid, flew from the lips of one to those of another, so that the first maid pointed him out to many persons and at several times, and others joined her in asserting that he was the person, and in spreading the discovery of him more widely. John even relates (<a name="ii.xxxv-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025">joh 18:25</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p21.2"></a>) that, at the second time, 			 the question was put to Peter, not by <i>a maid, </i>but by a multitude of men; from which it is evident that the word, which had been pronounced by the <i>maid, </i>was caught by the men standing by, who attacked Peter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p22"></a>There is another difference between Mark and the other three Evangelists; for he mentions that <i>the cock crew twice, </i>while they say that <i>the cock crew </i>not until after Peter had thrice denied our Lord. But this difficulty is easily obviated; for 			 Mark says nothing that is inconsistent with the narrative of the other Evangelists, but explains more fully what they pass by in silence. Indeed, I have no doubt that, when Christ said to Peter, <i>before the cock crow, </i>he meant the <i>cock-crowing,</i>   			  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">238</font></a>
  			  which includes many <i>crowings; </i>for <i>cocks </i>do not merely <i>crow </i>once, but repeat their <i>crowings 			 </i>many times; and yet all the <i>crowings </i>of a single watch are called but one <i>cock-crowing. </i>So then, Matthew, Luke, and John, say that Peter thrice denied our Lord before the <i>cock-crowing </i>was ended. Mark states more distinctly one circumstance, that within a short space of time Peter was brought even to the <i>third </i>denial, and that, though he had been warned by the first <i>crowing, </i>he did not repent. None of us will say that profane 			 historians are inconsistent with each other, when some one of them relates what the others have not touched; and, therefore, though Mark’s narrative is different, still it does not contradict the others.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p24"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p25"></a><b>72.</b><i> And the second time he denied with an oath. </i>It deserves attention, that Peter, after finding that he could not escape by a simple denial, doubles his crime by adding <i>an oath; </i>and a little after, when he is still 			 more vehemently pressed, he proceeds even to <i>cursing. </i>Hence we infer that a sinner, after having once fallen, is always hurried on from bad to worse; so that those who begin with ordinary offenses afterwards rush headlong into the basest crimes, from which at first they would have recoiled with horror. And this is the just vengeance of God, after we have deprived ourselves of the assistance of the Holy 			 Spirit, to allow Satan a violent exercise of power over us, that, having subdued and made us his slaves, he may drive us wherever he pleases. But this happens chiefly in a denial of the faith; for when a man, through fear of the cross, has turned aside from a pure profession of the gospel, if he perceive that his enemies are not yet satisfied, will proceed farther, and what he had not ventured fully to acknowledge he <i>denies 			 </i>flatly <i>with an oath, </i>and without any ambiguity of words.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p26"></a>We ought also to observe, that almost in a single moment Peter <i>thrice </i>gave way; for this shows how unsteady we are, and how liable to fall, whenever Satan drives us. Certainly we shall never cease to fall, if the Lord do not stretch out his hand to uphold us. When the rigor of the grace of Christ was extinguished in Peter, whoever 			 might afterwards meet hit and interrogate him about Christ, he would have been ready to <i>deny </i>a hundred or a thousand times. Although, then, it was very base in him to fall <i>thrice, </i>yet the Lord spared him by restraining the tongues of enemies from making additional attacks upon him. Thus, also, it is every day 			 necessary for the Lord to bridle Satan, lest he overwhelm us with innumerable temptations; for though he does not cease to employ many instruments in assailing us, were it not that the Lord, paying regard to our weakness, restrains the violence of his rage, we would have to contend against a prodigious amount of temptations. In this respect, therefore, we ought to praise the mercy of the Lord, who does not permit our enemy to make advances against us, almost the hundredth part of what he would 			 desire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p27"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p27.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p28"></a><b>74.</b> <i>Then he began to curse and to swear. </i>In this third denial, Peter’s unfaithfulness to his Master reached its utmost height. Not satisfied with <i>swearing, </i>he breaks out into 			 <i>cursing, </i>by which he abandons his body and soul to destruction; for he prays that the curse of God may fall upon him, if he knows Christ. It is as much as if he had said, May I perish miserably, if I have any thing in common with the salvation of God! So much the more ought we to admire the goodness of Christ, who rescued his disciple from such fatal ruin, and healed him. Now this passage shows, that 			 when a man falling through weakness of the flesh, denies the truth though he knows it, this does not amount to “blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” (<a name="ii.xxxv-p28.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031">Matt. 12:31</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032">32</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p28.2"></a>.) Peter had unquestionably heard from the mouth of the Lord how detestable treachery it is to deny him before men; and what dreadful vengeance, <i>before God and before his angels, </i>(<a name="ii.xxxv-p28.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039">Mt 10:39</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p28.3"></a> <a name="ii.xxxv-p28.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#009">Lu 12:9</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p28.4"></a>) awaits those who, through a cowardly dread of the cross, abandon the confession of faith; and not without reason had he, a little before, preferred death and every kind of 			 torment to denying Christ. Now, therefore, he throws himself down knowingly, and after previous warning; but afterwards he obtains pardon; from which it follows that he sinned through weakness and not through incurable malice. For he would willingly have rendered to Christ the duties of friendship which he owed him, had not fear extinguished the sparks of proper affection.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p29"></a><a name="ii.xxxv-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p30"></a><b>75.</b> <i>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus. </i>To the voice of <i>the cock, </i>Luke informs us, there was 			 also added the <i>look </i>of Christ; for previously — as we learn from Mark — he had paid no attention to the <i>cock </i>when <i>crowing. </i>He must, therefore, have received the 			 <i>look </i>from Christ, in order that he might come to himself. We all have experience of the same thing in ourselves; for which of us does not pass by with indifference and with deaf ears — I do not say the varied and numerous songs of birds which however, excite us to glorify God — but even the voice of God, which is heard clearly and distinctly in the doctrine of the Law and of the Gospel? Nor is it for a 			 single day only that our minds are held by such brutal stupidity, but it is perpetual until he who alone turns the hearts of men deigns to <i>look </i>upon us. It is proper to observe, however that this was no ordinary <i>look, </i>for he had formerly <i>looked 			 </i>at Judas who, after all, became no better by it. But in <i>looking at Peter, </i>he added to his eyes the secret efficacy of the Spirit, and thus by the rays of his grace, penetrated into his heart. Let us therefore know, that whenever any one has fallen, his repentance will never begin, until the Lord has <i>looked 			 </i>at him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p31"></a><i>And he went out and wept bitterly. </i>It is probable that Peter <i>went out </i>through fear, for he did not venture to <i>weep </i>in presence of witnesses; and here he gave another proof of his weakness. Hence we infer that he did not deserve pardon by satisfaction, but that 			 he obtained it by the fatherly kindness of God. And by this example we are taught that we ought to entertain confident hope, though our repentance be lame; for God does not despise even weak repentance, provided that it be sincere. Yet Peter’s tears, which he shed in secret, testified before God and the angels that his repentance was true; for, having withdrawn from the eyes of men, he places before him God and the angels; and, therefore, those tears flow from the deep feelings of his heart. 			 This deserves our attention; for we see many who shed tears purposely, so long as they are beheld by others, but who have no sooner retired than they have dry eyes. Now there is no room to doubt that tears, which do not flow on account of the judgment of God, are often drawn forth by ambition and hypocrisy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxv-p32"></a>But it may be asked, Is weeping requisite in true repentance? I reply, Believers often with dry eyes groan before the Lord without hypocrisy, and confess their fault to obtain pardon; but in more aggravated offenses they must be in no ordinary degree stupid and hardened, whose hearts are not pained by grief and sorrow, and who do not feel ashamed even so far as to shed tears. And, therefore Scripture, after having convicted 			 men of their crimes, exhorts them to <i>sackcloth and ashes, </i>(<a name="ii.xxxv-p32.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003">Da 9:3</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p32.1"></a>; <a name="ii.xxxv-p32.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006">Jon 3:6</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p32.2"></a>; <a name="ii.xxxv-p32.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021">Mt 11:21</a><a name="ii.xxxv-p32.3"></a>.)</p>
