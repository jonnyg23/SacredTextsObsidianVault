 <p><a name="ii.viii-p14"></a><b><a name="ii.viii-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042">Matthew 22:42</a><a name="ii.viii-p14.2"></a>.</b> <i>What think you of Christ? </i>Mark and Luke express more clearly the reason why Christ put this question. It was because there prevailed among <i>the scribes </i>an erroneous opinion, that the promised Redeemer would be one of <i>David’s </i>sons and successors, who would bring along with him nothing more elevated than human nature. For from the very commencement Satan endeavored, by all the arts which he could devise, to put forward some pretended Christ, who was not the true Mediator 			 between God and men. God having so frequently promised that Christ would proceed from the <i>seed, </i>or from the <i>loins of David, </i>this conviction was so deeply rooted in their minds, that they could not endure to have him stripped of human nature. Satan therefore permitted Christ to be acknowledged as a true man and a 			 <i>son of David, </i>for he would in vain have attempted to overturn this article of faith; but—what was worse—he stripped him of his Divinity, as if he had been only one of the ordinary descendants of Adam. But in this manner the hope of future and eternal life, as well as spiritual righteousness, was abolished. And ever since Christ was manifested to the world, heretics have attempted by various 			 contrivances—and as it were under ground—to overturn sometimes his human, and sometimes his Divine nature, that either he might not have full power to save us, or we might not have ready access to him. Now as the hour of his death was already approaching, the Lord himself intended to attest his divinity, that all the godly might boldly rely on him; for if he had been only man, we would have had no right either to glory in him, or to expect salvation from him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p15"></a>We now perceive his design, which was, to assert that he was the Son of God, not so much on his own account, as to make our faith rest on his heavenly power. For as the weakness of the flesh, by which he approached to us, gives us confidence, that we may not hesitate to draw near to him, so if that weakness alone were before our eyes, it would rather fill us with fear and despair than excite proper confidence. Yet it must 			 be observed, that <i>the scribes </i>are not reproved for teaching that <i>Christ would be the Son of David, </i>but for imagining that he was a mere man, who would come from heaven, to assume the nature and person of a man. Nor does our Lord make a direct assertion about himself, but simply shows that <i>the scribes </i>hold a wicked error in expecting that the Redeemer will proceed only from the earth and from human lineage. But though this doctrine was well known to be held by them, we learn from Matthew, that he interrogated them in presence of the people what their sentiments were.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p16"></a><a name="ii.viii-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p17"></a><b>43.</b> <i>How then does David by the Spirit call him Lord. </i>The assertion made by Christ, that <i>David </i>spoke <i>by the Spirit, </i>is emphatic; for he contrasts the prediction of a future event with 			 the testimony of a present event. By this phrase he anticipates the sophistry by which the Jews of the present day attempt to escape. They allege that this prediction celebrates the reign of <i>David, </i>as if, representing God to be the Author of his reign, <i>David </i>would rise above the mad attempts of his enemies, and affirmed that they would gain nothing by opposing the will of God. That <i>the scribes </i>might not shelter themselves under such an objection, Christ began with stating that the psalm was not composed in reference to the person of <i>David, </i>but was dictated <i>by the </i>prophetic <i>Spirit </i>to describe the future reign of Christ; as it may easily be learned even from the passage itself, that what we 			 read there does not apply either to <i>David, </i>or to any other earthly king; for there <i>David </i>introduces a king clothed with a new priesthood, by which the ancient shadows of the Law must be abolished, (<a name="ii.viii-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Ps 110:4</a><a name="ii.viii-p17.2"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p18"></a>We must now see how he proves that Christ will hold a higher rank than to be merely descended from the seed of <i>David. </i>It is because <i>David, </i>who was king and head of the people, <i>calls him Lord; </i>from which it follows, that there is something in him greater than man. But the argument appears to be feeble and inconclusive; for it may be objected that, when <i>David </i>gave the psalm to the people to sing, without having any 			 view to his own person, he assigned to Christ dominion over others. But to this I reply that, as he was one of the members of the Church, nothing would have been more improper than to shut himself out from the common doctrine. Here he enjoins all the children of God to boast, as with one voice, that they are safe through the protection of a heavenly and invincible King. If he be separated from the body of the Church, he will not partake of the salvation promised through Christ. If this were the 			 voice of a few persons, the dominion of Christ would not extend even to <i>David. </i>But now neither he, nor any other person, can be excluded from subjection to him, without cutting himself off from the hope of eternal salvation. Since then there was nothing better for <i>David </i>than to be included in the Church, it was not less for himself than for the rest of the people that <i>David </i>composed this psalm. In short, by this title Christ is pronounced to be supreme and sole King, who 			 holds the preeminence among all believers; and no exception ought to be allowed to ranking all in one class, when he is appointed to be the Redeemer of the Church. There can be no doubt, therefore, that David represents himself also as a subject of his government, so as to be reckoned one of the number of the people of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p19"></a>But now another question arises: Might not God have raised up one whom he appointed from among mankind to be a Redeemer, so as to be <i>David’s Lord, </i>though <i>he was his son? </i>For here it is not the essential name of God, but only <i>Adonai</i>   			  <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">83</font></a>
  			  that is employed, and this term is frequently applied to men. I reply: Christ takes for granted that he who is taken out of the number of men, and raised to such a rank of honor, as to be the supreme Head of the whole Church, is not a mere man, but possesses also the majesty of God. For the eternal God, who by an oath makes this claim for himself, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.viii-p21"></a>before him every knee shall bow, (<a name="ii.viii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</a><a name="ii.viii-p21.1"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p22"></a>at the same time swears that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.viii-p23"></a>he will not give his glory to another, (<a name="ii.viii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008">Isa 42:8</a><a name="ii.viii-p23.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p24"></a>But, according to the testimony of Paul, when Christ was raised to kingly power,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.viii-p25"></a>there was given to him a name which is above every name, that before him every knee should bow, (<a name="ii.viii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011">Ro 14:11</a><a name="ii.viii-p25.1"></a>; <a name="ii.viii-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Php 2:9</a><a name="ii.viii-p25.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p26"></a>And though Paul had never said this, yet such is the fact, that Christ is above <i>David </i>and other holy kings, because he also ranks higher than angels; which would not apply to a created man, unless he were also</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.viii-p27"></a>God manifested in the flesh, (<a name="ii.viii-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">1Ti 3:16</a><a name="ii.viii-p27.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p28"></a>I do acknowledge that his divine essence is not expressed directly and in so many words; but it may easily be inferred that He is God, who is placed above all creatures.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p29"></a><a name="ii.viii-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p30"></a><b>44.</b> <i>The </i>Lord <i>said to my Lord. </i>Here the Holy Spirit puts into the mouth of all the godly a song of triumph, that they may boldly defy Satan and all the ungodly, and 			 mock at their rage, when they endeavor to drive Christ from his throne. That they may not hesitate or tremble, when they perceive great emotions produced in the earth, they are commanded to place the holy and inviolable decree of God in opposition to all the exertions of adversaries. The meaning therefore is: whatever may be the madness of men, all that they shall dare to contrive will be of no avail for destroying the kingdom of Christ, which has been set up, not by the will of men, but by the 			 appointment of God, and therefore is supported by everlasting strength. Whenever this kingdom is violently attacked, let us call to remembrance this revelation from heaven; for undoubtedly this promise was put into the hand of Christ, that every believer may apply it to his own use. But God never changes or deceives, so as to retract what has once gone out of his mouth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.viii-p31"></a><i>Sit at my right hand. </i>This phrase is used metaphorically for the second or next rank, which is occupied by God’s deputy. And therefore it signifies, to hold the highest government and power in the name of God, as we know that God has committed his authority to his only-begotten Son, so as to govern his Church by his agency. This mode of expression, 			 therefore, does not denote any particular place, but, on the contrary, embraces heaven and earth under the government of Christ. And God declares that Christ will <i>sit till his enemies </i>be subdued, in order to inform us that his kingdom will remain invincible against every attack; not that, when <i>his enemies </i>have 			 been subdued, he will be deprived of the power which had been granted to him, but that, while the whole multitude of his enemies shall be laid low, his power will remain for ever unimpaired. In the meantime, it points out that condition of his kingdom which we perceive in the present day, that we may not be uneasy when we see it attacked on all sides.</p>
