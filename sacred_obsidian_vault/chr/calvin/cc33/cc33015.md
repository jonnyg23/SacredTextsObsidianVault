 <p><a name="ii.xiv-p10"></a><b><a name="ii.xiv-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043">Mark 12:43</a><a name="ii.xiv-p10.2"></a>.</b> <i>Verily I say to you. </i>This reply of Christ contains a highly useful doctrine that whatever men offer to God ought to be estimated not by its apparent value,   			  <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">122</font></a>
  			  but only by the feeling of the heart, and that the holy affection of him who according to his small means, offers to God the little that he has, is more worthy of esteem than that of him who offers a hundred times more <i>out of his abundance. </i>In two ways this doctrine is useful, for the poor who appear not to have the power of doing good, are encouraged by our Lord not to 			 hesitate to express their affection cheerfully out of their slender means; for if they consecrate themselves, their offering, which appears to be mean and worthless, will not be less valuable than if they had presented all the treasures of Crœsus.   			  <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">123</font></a>
  			  On the other hand, those who possess greater abundance, and who have received from God larger communications, are reminded that it is not enough if in the amount of their beneficence they greatly surpass the poor and common people; because it is of less value in the sight of God that a rich man, out of a vast heap, should bestow a moderate sum, than that a poor man, by giving very little, should exhaust his store. <i>This widow </i>must have been a person of no ordinary piety, who, rather than come empty into the presence of God, chose to part with <i>her own living. </i>And our Lord applauds this sincerity, because, forgetting herself, she wished to testify that she and all that she possessed belonged to God. In like manner, the chief sacrifice which God requires from us is 			 self-denial. As to the <i>sacred offerings, </i>it is probable that they were not at that time applied properly, or to lawful purposes; but as the service of the Law was still in force, Christ does not reject them. And certainly the abuses of men could not prevent the sincere worshippers of God from doing what was holy, and in accordance with the command of God, when they offered for sacrifices and other pious 			 uses.</p>
