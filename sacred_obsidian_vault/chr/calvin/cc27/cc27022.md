 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds at Tekos, which he saw concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake; and he said,—</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Jehovah from Zion will roar, And from Jerusalem will he utter his voice; And perish shall the habitations of shepherds, And wither shall the top of Carmel.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,— For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; (157) Because they have threshed Gilead with iron wains:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And I will send fire into the house of Hazael, And it shall devour the palaces of Benhadad;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And I will break in pieces the bar of Damascus, And cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, And the holder of the scepter from the house of Eden; And removed shall be the people of Syria to Kir, saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,— For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For they carried away a complete captivity, To shut them up in Edom:</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, And the holder of the scepter from Ascalon; And I will turn my hand against Ekron, And perish shall the remnants of the Philistines, Saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,— For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For they have shut up a complete captivity in Edom, And have not remembered the covenant of brethren:</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,— For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For he pursued with the sword his own brother, And destroyed his own compassions; And raged continually has his anger, And his wrath has he kept perpetually:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>And I will send a fire on Teman, And it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,— For three transgressions of the children o Ammon, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have rent the pregnant women of Gilead, That they might extend their own borders:</p>
