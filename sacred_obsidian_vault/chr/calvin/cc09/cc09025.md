 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN13"><a name="xxvi-p1"></a>PSALM 60</p>  		
 <p><a name="xxvi-p2"></a>David, who was now settled upon the throne, and had gained several signal victories, tending to confirm him in the kingdom, in this Psalm exalts the goodness of God, that he might at once express his gratitude, and by conciliating the favor of such as still stood out against his interests, unite the community, which had been rent into factions. Having first adverted to the clear indications of the Divine favor, which proved that God had chosen him 		  to be king, he more particularly calls the attention of the faithful to the oracle itself, in order to convince them that they could only comply with the mind of God, by yielding their consent and approbation to the anointing which he had received from Samuel. Prayers also are offered up throughout the psalm, urging God to perfect what he had begun.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent21"><a name="xxvi-p3"></a>To the chief musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam   		   <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">377</font></a>
  		   of David, to teach; when he strove with the Syrians of Mesopotamia, and with the Syrians of Zoba, and when Joab returned, and smote of the Edomites in the valley of Salt twelve thousand.</p>  		
 <p><a name="xxvi-p5"></a>Of the first part of this title I have spoken in another place, and shall not insist upon it further than to repeat, that <i>Shushan-eduth, the lily of witness, </i>  		   <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">378</font></a>
  		  <i> or of beauty, </i>seem to have been the first words of some song which was commonly known at the time. It is added, <i>to teach; </i>and this, as some have thought, because the psalm was given to the Levites, that they might learn it. But others have very properly rejected this idea, as we cannot suppose that a title, which is equally applicable to all the psalms, would have been here used as a term of distinction. More probably it points at a particular instruction or doctrine, 		  which would be taught by the following psalm. We may suppose that David, who had gained so many decisive victories, but had not the satisfaction, as yet, of seeing the kingdom finally settled under him, employs the word to denote that he had a special lesson to enforce, which was, the duty of all who had hitherto opposed him to put an end to factions, and, after such convincing evidences, acknowledge that he was their divinely-appointed king. Let experience, at least, as if he had said, prove 		  that the sovereignty which I hold meets with the approbation of God, crowned, as it is, in the eyes of all, with so many tokens of his favor. The psalm is described as being a kind of triumphal song for victories obtained over the Syrians and other allied nations. As the Jews reckon Mesopotamia, and other countries, to be included in Syria, which they call Aram, they are forced subsequently to distinguish it into different parts, as here we find <i>Syria Naharim </i>put for Mesopotamia, which 		  some of the Latins have named Interamnis, (or, <i>between two rivers,) </i>following the Greek etymology; for Mesopotamia in Greek means between two rivers, that is, between the Tigris and Euphrates.  		   <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">379</font></a>
  		  Next, we have <i>Syria Soba </i>mentioned, which some have considered upon good grounds to be Sophene, because adjacent to the bank of the Euphrates; and David is said (<a name="xxvi-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003">2Sa 8:3</a><a name="xxvi-p7.2"></a>) to have smitten Rehob, king of Soba, as he went to recover his border at the river. In the same passage, we read of a third Syria, that of Damascus, nearer to Judea, and almost touching upon it. Syria is, in other places of 		  Scripture, represented as still more extensive, and has epithets attached to it according to the different territories which are meant to be pointed out. As David had war with the more adjacent part of Syria, and routed the army which had come out from it to the assistance of the Ammonites, it may be asked why he speaks only of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia and Soba. I think it probable that he specifies the more distant nations, as being the most formidable, and as affording a more 		  illustrious proof of the Divine favor which accompanied his arms. For this reason, he passes over the more neighboring nations, and mentions those which were situated at a distance, the terror of which was known only by report, and whose overthrow was something unheard of, and almost incredible. In the inspired history, two-and-twenty thousand are said to have been slain,  		   <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">380</font></a>
  		  (<a name="xxvi-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012">1Ch 18:12</a><a name="xxvi-p8.1"></a>,) in the title of this psalm only twelve thousand; but the apparent inconsistency is easily explained. It is Abishai whom the history represents as defeating the forces, which are here said to have been overthrown by Joab. We are to consider that the army was divided between the two brothers. Abishai being inferior in rank and authority, we need not wonder that the praise of the 		  victory is ascribed to him who was the chief commander, although both had a share in gaining it; as in <a name="xxvi-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#007">1Sa 18:7</a><a name="xxvi-p8.2"></a>, David is described as having the whole honor of the victory, because he was the individual under whose auspices it had been accomplished. It is probable that about half the number mentioned in the history fell during the main engagement, and that the rest having fled from the field, were put to 		  the sword by Joab in their retreat.  		   <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">381</font></a>

 <p><a name="xxvi.i-p6"></a><b>1.</b> <i>O God! thou hast cast us off. </i>With the view of exciting both himself and others to a more serious consideration of the goodness of God, which they presently experienced, he begins the psalm with prayer; and a comparison is instituted, designed to show that the government of Saul had been under the divine 			 reprobation. He complains of the sad confusions into which the nation had been thrown, and prays that God would return to it in mercy, and re-establish its affairs. Some have thought that David here adverts to his own distressed condition: this is not probable. I grant that, before coming to the throne, he underwent severe afflictions; but in this place he evidently speaks of the whole people as well as himself. The calamities which he describes are such as extended to the whole kingdom; and I 			 have not the least doubt, therefore, that he is to be considered as drawing a comparison which might illustrate the favor of God, as it had been shown so remarkably, from the first, to his own government. With this view, he deplores the long-continued and heavy disasters which had fallen upon the people of God under Saul’s administration. It is particularly noticeable, that though he had found his own countrymen his worst and bitterest foes, now that he sat upon the throne, he forgets all the 			 injuries which they had done him, and, mindful only of the situation which he occupied, associates himself with the rest of them in his addresses to God. The <i>scattered</i> condition of the nation is what he insists upon as the main calamity. In consequence of the dispersion of Saul’s forces, the country lay completely exposed to the incursions of enemies; not a man was safe in his own 			 house, and no relief remained but in flight or banishment. He next describes the confusions which reigned by a metaphor, representing the country as <i>opened, </i>or <i>cleft asunder; </i>not that there had been a literal earthquake, but that the kingdom, in its rent and shattered condition, presented that calamitous aspect which generally follows upon an earthquake. The affairs of Saul ceased to prosper from 			 the time that he forsook God; and when he perished at last, he left the nation in a state little short of ruin. The greatest apprehension must have been felt throughout it; it was become the scorn of its enemies, and was ready to submit to any yoke, however degrading, which promised tolerable conditions. Such is the manner in which David intimates that the divine favor had been alienated by Saul, pointing, when he says that God was <i>displeased, </i>at the radical source of all the evils which prevailed; and he prays that the same physician who had broken would heal.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxvi.i-p7"></a><a name="xxvi.i-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxvi.i-p8"></a><b>3.</b> <i>Thou hast showed thy people hard things</i> He says, first, that the nation had been dealt with severely, and then adds a figure which may additionally represent the grievousness of its calamities, speaking of it as drunk with the wine of stupor or astonishment. Even the Hebraist 			 interpreters are not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of <a name="xxvi.i-p8.1"></a>תרעלה, <i>tarelah, </i>which I have rendered <i>astonishment. </i>Several of them translate it <i>poison. </i>But it is evident that the Psalmist alludes to some kind of poisoned drink, which 			 deprives a person of his senses, insinuating that the Jews were stupified by their calamities.   			  <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">383</font></a>
  			  He would place, in short, before their eyes the curse of God, which had pressed upon the government of Saul, and induce them to abandon their obstinate attempts to maintain the interests of a throne which lay under the divine reprobation.</p>  <a name="xxvi.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxvi.ii-p7"></a><b>4</b> <i>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee.</i> Some interpreters would change the past tense, and read the words as if they formed a continuation of the prayers which precede — <i>O that thou wouldst give a 			 banner to them that fear thee!</i>   			  <a name="fr_385"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">386</font></a>
  			  But it is better to suppose that David diverges to the language of congratulation, and, by pointing to the change which had taken place, calls attention to the evident appearances of the divine favor. He returns thanks to God, in the name of all the people, for having raised a standard which might at once cheer their hearts, and unite their divided numbers.   			  <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">387</font></a>
  			  It is a poor and meagre interpretation which some have attached to the words, <i>before the truth, </i>that God showed favor to the Jews because he had found them true-hearted, and sound in his cause. Those in the higher ranks had, as is well known, proved eminently disloyal; the common people had, along with their king, broken their divine allegiance: from 			 the highest to the lowest in the kingdom all had conspired to overthrow the gracious purpose of God. It is evident, then, that David refers to the truth of God as having emerged in a signal manner, now that the Church began to be restored. This was an event which had not been expected. Indeed, who did not imagine, in the desperate circumstances, that God’s promises had altogether failed? But when David mounted the throne, his truth, which had been so long obscured, again shone forth. The 			 advantage which ensued extended to the whole nation; but David intimates that God had a special respect to his own people, whose deliverance, however few they might be in number, he particularly contemplated.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxvi.ii-p10"></a>He next proceeds to address God again in prayer; although, I may observe in passing, the words which follow, <i>that thy beloved may be delivered, </i>are read by some in connection with the preceding verse. I am myself inclined to adopt that construction; for David would seem to magnify 			 the illustration which had been given of the divine favor, by adverting to the change which had taken place,   			  <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">388</font></a>
  			  God having inspirited his people so far as to display a banner; where, formerly, they were reduced to a state of extremity, from which it seemed impossible to escape without a miracle. In the previous verse he calls them <i>fearers </i>of the Lord, and now his <i>beloved; </i>implying that, when God rewards such as fear and worship him, it is always with a respect to his own free 			 love. And prayer is subjoined: for however great may be the favors which God has bestowed upon us, modesty and humility will teach us always to pray that he would perfect what his goodness has begun.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxvi.ii-p12"></a><a name="xxvi.ii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxvi.ii-p13"></a><b>6.</b> <i>God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice. </i>Hitherto he has adverted to the proofs which had come under their own observation, and from which they might easily see that God had manifested his favor in a manner new, and for many years unprecedented. He had raised the nation 			 from a state of deep distress to prosperity, and had changed the aspect of affairs so far, that one victory was following another in rapid succession. But now he calls their attention to a point of still greater importance, the divine promise — the fact that God had previously declared all this with his own mouth. However numerous and striking may be the practical demonstrations we receive of the favor of God, we can never recognize them, except in connection with his previously revealed 			 promise. What follows, although spoken by David as of himself individually, may be considered as the language adopted by the people generally, of whom he was the political head. Accordingly, he enjoins them, provided they were not satisfied with the sensible proofs of divine favor, to reflect upon the oracle by which he had been made king in terms the most distinct and remarkable.   			  <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">389</font></a>
  			  He says that God had spoken <i>in his holiness, </i>not <i>by his Holy Spirit, </i>as some, with an over-refinement of interpretation, have rendered it, nor <i>by</i> <i>his holy place, the sanctuary;</i>   			  <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">390</font></a>
  			  for we read of no response having been given from it to the prophet Samuel. It is best to retain the term <i>holiness, </i>as he adverts to the fact of the truth of the oracle having been confirmed, and the constancy and efficacy of the promise having been placed beyond all doubt by numerous proof, of a practical kind. As no room had 			 been left for question upon the point, he employs this epithet to put honor upon the words which had been spoken by Samuel. He immediately adds, that this word of God was the chief ground upon which he placed his trust. It might be true that he had gained many victories, and that these had tended to encourage his heart; but he intimates, that no testimony which he had received of this kind gave him so much satisfaction as the word. This accords with the general experience of the Lord’s people. 			 Cheered, as they unquestionably are, by every expression of the divine goodness, still faith must ever be considered as holding the highest place — as being that which dissipates their worst sorrows, and quickens them even when dead to a happiness which is not of this world. Nor does David mean that he merely rejoiced himself. He includes, in general, all who feared the Lord in that Kingdom. And now he proceeds to give the sum of the oracle, which it is observable that he does in such a way as 			 to show, in the very narration of it, how firmly he believed in its truth: for he speaks of it as something which admitted of no doubt whatsoever, and boasts that he would do what God had promised. <i>I will divide Shechem, he says, and mete out the valley of Succoth</i>    			  <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">391</font></a>
  			  The parts which he names are those that were more late of coming into his possession, and which would appear to have been yet in the hands of Saul’s son, when this psalm was written. A severe struggle being necessary for their acquisition, he asserts that, though late of being subdued, they would certainly be brought under his subjection in due time, as God had condescended to engage this by his word. So with <i>Gilead and Manasseh</i>    			  <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">392</font></a>
  			  As <i>Ephraim</i> was the most populous of all the tribes, he appropriately terms it the <i>strength of his head, </i>that is, of his dominions.   			  <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">393</font></a>
  			  To procure the greater credit to the oracle, by showing that it derived a sanction from antiquity, he adds, that <i>Judah</i> would be <i>his lawgiver, </i>or <i>chief; </i>which was equivalent to saying, 			 that the posterity of Abraham could never prosper unless, in agreeableness to the prediction of the patriarch Jacob, they were brought under the government of Judah, or of one who was sprung from that tribe. He evidently alludes to what is narrated by Moses, (<a name="xxvi.ii-p18.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Ge 49:10</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p18.4"></a>,) “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from 			 between his feet, until Shiloh come.” The same word is there used, <a name="xxvi.ii-p18.5"></a>מחוקק, <i>Mechokek, </i>or legislator. It followed, that no government could stand which was not resident in the tribe of Judah, this being the decree and the good pleasure of God. The words are more appropriate in the mouth of the people than of David; and, as already remarked, 			 he does not speak in his own name, but in that of the Church at large.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxvi.ii-p19"></a><a name="xxvi.ii-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxvi.ii-p20"></a><b>8</b>  <i>Moab is my wash-pot</i> In proceeding to speak of foreigners, he observes a wide distinction between them and his own countrymen. The posterity of Abraham he would govern as brethren, and not as slaves; but it was allowable for him 			 to exercise greater severities upon the profane and the uncircumcised, in order to their being brought under forcible subjection. In this he affords no precedent to conquerors who would inflict lawless oppression upon nations taken in war; for they want the divine warrant and commission which David had, invested as he was not only with the authority of a king, but with the character of an avenger of the Church, especially of its more implacable enemies, such as had thrown off every feeling of 			 humanity, and persisted in harassing a people descended from the same stock with themselves. He remarks, in contempt of the Moabites, that they would be a vessel in which he should wash his feet, the washing of the feet being, as is well known, a customary practice in Eastern nations.   			  <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">394</font></a>
  			  With the same view he speaks of casting his shoe over Edom. This is expressive of reproach, and intimates, that as it had once insulted over the chosen people of God, so now it should be reduced to servitude.   			  <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">395</font></a>
  			  What follows concerning Palestina is ambiguous. By some the words are taken ironically, as if David would deride the vain boastings of the Philistines, who were constantly assaulting him with all the petulance which they could command.   			  <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">396</font></a>
  			  And the Hebrew verb <a name="xxvi.ii-p23.2"></a>רוע, <i>ruang, </i>though it means in general <i>to shout with triumph, </i>signifies also to make a tumult, as soldiers when they rush to battle. Others, without supposing any ironical allusion, take the words as they stand, and interpret them as meaning 			 servile plaudits; that much and obstinately as they hated his dominion, they would be forced to hail and applaud him as conqueror. Thus in <a name="xxvi.ii-p23.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044">Ps 18:44</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p23.3"></a>, it is said, “The sons of the strangers shall feign submission to me.”   			  <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">397</font></a>

 <p><a name="xxvi.iii-p6"></a><b>9</b> <i>Who will bring me into the fortified city?</i> Anticipating an objection which might be alleged, he proceeds to state that he looked to God for the accomplishment of what remained to be done in the capture of the fortified places of his enemies, and the 			 consolidation of his victories. It might be said, that as a considerable number continued to resist his claims, the confident terms which he had used were premature. God, however, had pledged his word that every nation which set itself in opposition to him would be brought under his power, and in the face of remaining difficulties and dangers he advances with certainty of success. By the <i>fortified city,</i>   			  <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">399</font></a>
  			  some understand Rabbah, the capital of the Moabites. Others, with more probability, consider that the singular is used for the plural number, and that David alludes in general to the different cities under protection of which his enemies were determined to stand out. He declares, that the same God who had crowned his arms with victory in the open field would lead him on to the siege of these cities. With a view to prove his legitimate call 			 to the government, he amplifies a second time the marks of the divine favor which it had received, by contrasting it with that which preceded. “The God,” he says, “who had formerly cast us off, and abandoned us to unsuccessful warfare, will now lay open before me the gates of hostile cities, and enable me to break through all their fortifications.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxvi.iii-p8"></a><a name="xxvi.iii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxvi.iii-p9"></a><b>11</b>  <i>Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</i> Again he reverts to the exercise of prayer, or rather is led to it naturally by the very confidence of hope, which we have seen that he entertained. He expresses his 			 conviction, that should God extend his help, it would be sufficient of itself, although no assistance should be received from any other quarter. Literally it reads, <i>Give us help from trouble, and vain is the help of man</i> “O God,” as if he had said, “when pleased to put forth thy might, thou needest none to help thee; and when, therefore, once assured of an interest in thy favor, 			 there is no reason why we should desire the aid of man. All other resources of a worldly nature vanish before the brightness of thy power.” The copulative in the verse, however, has been generally resolved into the causal particle, and I have not scrupled to follow the common practice. It were well if the sentiment expressed were effectually engraven upon our hearts. Why is it almost universally the case with men that they are either staggered in their resolution, or buoy themselves up with 			 confidences, vain, because not derived from God, but just because they have no apprehension of that salvation which he can extend, which is of itself sufficient, and without which, any earthly succor is entirely ineffectual? In contrasting the help of God with that of man, he employs language not strictly correct, for, in reality, there is no such thing as a power in man to deliver at all. But, in our ignorance, we conceive as if there were various kinds of help in the world, and he uses the 			 word in accommodation to our false ideas. God, in accomplishing our preservation, may use the agency of man, but he reserves it to himself, as his peculiar prerogative, to deliver, and will not suffer them to rob him of his glory. The deliverance which comes to us in this manner through human agency must properly be ascribed to God. All that David meant to assert is, that such confidences as are not derived from God are worthless and vain. And to confirm this position, he declares in the last 			 verse of the psalm, that as, on the one hand, we can do nothing without him, so, on the other, we can do all things by his help. Two things are implied in the expression, <i>through God we shall do valiantly;</i>   			  <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">400</font></a>
  			  first, that if God withdraw his favor, any supposed strength which is in man will soon fail; and, on the other hand, that those whose sufficiency is derived from God only are armed with courage to overcome every difficulty. To show that it is no mere half credit which he gives God, he adds, in words which ascribe the whole work to him, that <i>it is he who shall tread down our enemies</i> Thus, even in our controversy with creatures like ourselves, we are not at liberty to share the honor of success with God; and must it not be accounted greater sacrilege still when men set free will in opposition to divine grace, and speak of their concurring equally with God in the matter of procuring eternal salvation? Those who arrogate the least fraction of strength to 			 themselves apart from God, only ruin themselves through their own pride.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi-p9"></a> There is another way in which this difference as to number may be reconciled besides that in which Calvin attempts to do it. “If the Hebrew numbers here,” says Street, “have been ever expressed by letters used as numerals, the variation might be accounted for; <a name="xxvi-p9.1"></a>יב being twelve, and <a name="xxvi-p9.2"></a>יח being eighteen, and many instances being to be found of the corruption of <a name="xxvi-p9.3"></a>ח into <a name="xxvi-p9.4"></a>ב. — See <i>Dr Kennicott</i>’<i>s Dissertation </i>on 				<a name="xxvi-p9.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#000">1 Chronicles 11</a><a name="xxvi-p9.5"></a>, page 96, where it is plainly shown that many errors in numbers have arisen from the numbers having been expressed by letters, and one letter having been mistaken for another.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.i-p3"></a> The three first verses, which complain of calamities and distresses, seem not to correspond to the title of the psalm, from which we would naturally expect the expressions of joy and praise for the victory obtained. Hare conjectures that these three verses have accidentally changed place with <a name="xxvi.i-p3.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002">Ps. 85:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003">3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004">4</a><a name="xxvi.i-p3.1"></a>. Archbishop 						Secker observes, that this conjecture “is bold, but otherwise very ingenious and plausible; and this change would make each psalm more consistent, and reconcile this psalm to its title very well; for the historical books mention no distress in the war to which the title refers.” Dr Adam Clarke considers this conjecture well founded; but others think the apparent discrepancy may be removed by supposing that the psalm was written after some of the battles of which mention is made in the title, 						and that the Author does not restrict himself to those events, but takes in a wider range, so as to embrace the afflictive condition both of Israel and Judah during the latter part of Saul’s life, and the former years of David’s reign.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.i-p9"></a> It was customary among the Hebrews to make their wine stronger and more inebriating by the addition of hotter and more powerful ingredients; such as honey, spices, <a name="xxvi.i-p9.2"></a><i>defrutum</i>, (<i>i</i> <i>e</i>., wine inspissated by boiling it down to two-thirds or one-half of the quantity,) mandrakes, opiates, and other drugs. Such were the stupifying ingredients which the celebrated Helen is represented, in Homer’s Odyssey, as mixing in the bowl, together with the wine, for her guests oppressed with grief, to raise their spirits; and such is probably the wine to which there is here an 				  allusion. The people were stupified by the heavy judgments of God, like a person stupified with wine which had been rendered more intoxicating by the deleterious drugs with which it had been mingled. This highly poetical language is not unfrequently employed to express the divine judgments: as in <a name="xxvi.i-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017">Isa. 51:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020">20</a><a name="xxvi.i-p9.3"></a>, and <a name="xxvi.i-p9.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015">Jer. 25:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016">16</a><a name="xxvi.i-p9.4"></a>. The original word <a name="xxvi.i-p9.5"></a>תרעלה,<i> tarelah</i>, means properly <i>trembling</i>, from the verb <a name="xxvi.i-p9.6"></a>רעל,<i> raal</i>, from which the English word <i>reel </i>is perhaps derived.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.ii-p9"></a> Hamer has given a very ingenious explanation of this passage, derived from the manners of the East. “It seems,” says he, “that the modern Eastern people have looked upon the giving them a <i>banner </i>as a more sure pledge of protection ‘than that given by words.’ So Albertus Aquensis tell us, that when Jerusalem was taken in 1099, about three hundred Saracens got upon the roof of a 				  very lofty building, and earnestly begged for quarter, but could not be induced, by any promises of safety, to come down, until they had received the banner of Tancred [one of the chiefs of the Crusade army] as a pledge of life. It did not, indeed, avail them, as that historian observes; for their behavior occasioned such indignation that they were destroyed to a man. The event showed the faithlessness of these zealots, whom no solemnities could bind; but the Saracens surrendering themselves 				  upon the delivery of a standard to them, proves in what a strong light they looked upon the giving them a banner; since it induced them to trust it when they would not trust any promises. Perhaps the delivery of a banner was anciently esteemed, in like manner, an obligation to protect, and the Psalmist might consider it in this light, when, upon a victory gained over the Syrians and Edomites, after the public affairs of Israel had been in a bad state, he says, ‘Thou hast showed thy people hard 				  things, etc.; thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee.’ Though thou didst for a time give up thine Israel into the hands of their enemies, thou hast now given them an assurance of thy having received them under thy protection.” —<i> Observations</i>,<i> volume </i>3, pp. 496, 497. Harmer supposes that our translation, which speaks of <i>a banner displayed</i>, is inaccurate; observing, that it is most probable that the Israelites anciently used only a spear, properly ornamented to distinguish it from a common one — a supposition which he founds on the fact, that a very long spear, covered all over with silver, and having a ball of gold on the top, was the standard of the Egyptian princes at the time of the Crusade wars, and was carried before 				  their armies. He proposes to read, “Thou hast given an ensign or standard [<a name="xxvi.ii-p9.1"></a>נם, <i>nes</i>] to them that fear thee, that it may be lifted up.” But Parkhurst considers the radical meaning of the Hebrew word <a name="xxvi.ii-p9.2"></a>נם, <i>nes</i>, to be <i>a banner </i>or <i>ensign</i>, from its <i>waving </i>or <i>streaming </i>in the wind; in other words, 				  <i>a streamer</i>  See his Lexicon on <a name="xxvi.ii-p9.3"></a>נם. Mant’s explanation of the phrase is similar to that of Calvin. “In this place,” says he, “it may mean no more than that God had united his people under one head, and so enabled them to meet their enemies by repairing to the standard of their sovereign.” 				  “The banner, or standard of an army,” says Walford, “is the object of constant attention to soldiers: so long as it is safe, and elevated, so long courage, hope, and energy, are maintained. The poet uses this symbol to express his hope that God Himself would be the source of their valor and success, in order that <i>the truth</i>, the promise made to David, might be accomplished.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.ii-p15"></a> This is the reading of Mudge, Street, Archbishop Secker, and Morrison. “Should not the word be read, <i>in his sanctuary</i>? whence the divine oracles were issued forth. David, having received a favorable answer, perhaps by Urim and Thummim, delivers himself in a strain of the fullest confidence of victory over his enemies.” — <i>Dimock</i>.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.ii-p16"></a> Shechem lay in Samaria, and, therefore, by it the whole of Samaria may be intended. The valley of Succoth, or booths, received its name from Jacob’s making booths, and feeding his cattle there. (See <a name="xxvi.ii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017">Gen. 33:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018">18</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p16.1"></a>.) It lay beyond the Jordan, and it may be employed to designate the whole of that district of country. Though Samaria, and 				  the country beyond the Jordan, were now in the hands of the enemy, yet David anticipates the time when he would gain complete and absolute possession of them, which he expresses by <i>dividing</i>, and <i>meting them out</i>. The allusion is to the dividing and measuring out of land; and it was a part of the power of a king to distribute his kingdom into cities and provinces, and to place judges and magistrates over them.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.ii-p21"></a> This office of washing the feet was in the East commonly performed by slaves, and the meanest of the family, as appears from what Abigail said to David when he took her to wife, “Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord,” <a name="xxvi.ii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#041">1Sa 25:41</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p21.1"></a>; and from the fact of our Savior 				  washing his disciples’ feet, to give them an example of humility, <a name="xxvi.ii-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005">Joh 13:5</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p21.2"></a>. The word <a name="xxvi.ii-p21.3"></a>νιπτὴρ, used in this last passage, signifies in general <i>a washing pot</i>,<i> 				  </i>and is put for the word <a name="xxvi.ii-p21.4"></a>ποδονιπτρον, the term which the Greeks, in strict propriety of speech, applied to a vessel for washing the feet. As this office was servile, so the vessels employed for this purpose were a mean part of household stuff. Gataker and Le Clerc illustrate this text from an anecdote related by Herodotus, concerning Amasis, king of Egypt, who expressed the 				  meanness of his own origin by comparing himself to a pot for washing the feet in, (Herod., Lib. 2, c. 172.) When, therefore, it is said, ‘Moab is my washing-pot,’ the complete and servile subjection of Moab to David is strongly marked. This is expressed not by comparing Moab to a slave who performs the lowest offices, as presenting to his master the basin for washing his feet, but by comparing him to the mean utensil itself. See <a name="xxvi.ii-p21.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002">2 Sam. 8:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001">1 Chr. 18:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#002">2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012">12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#013">13</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p21.5"></a></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxvi.ii-p22"></a> Edom or Idumea was inhabited by the Edomites, or posterity of Edom, that is, Esau, (the elder brother of Jacob,) who, on account of his profanity in selling his birthright for a mess of red pottage — called in Hebrew <i>Edom</i> — had this name imposed upon him to the perpetual disgrace of himself and his posterity, (<a name="xxvi.ii-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030">Gen. 25:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#008">Gen. 36:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009">9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016">Heb. 12:16</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p22.1"></a>.) The expression, “Over Edom will I cast my shoe,” has been differently explained by interpreters. Some, as Gataker and Martin, read, “To Edom will I cast my shoe;” and suppose that the reference is to the custom which then prevailed, of the master employing his meanest servant to untie, take off, and cleanse his shoes, 				  (<a name="xxvi.ii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011">Mt 3:11</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p22.2"></a>; <a name="xxvi.ii-p22.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016">Lu 3:16</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p22.3"></a>;) and that David intimates, that the Edomites would become his menial slaves, who would perform to him the lowest offices. “And the prophet,” observes Martin, “uses the word <i>throw</i>,<i> 				  </i>which marks an action done in a passionate and angry manner, in allusion to the circumstance that masters, when employing their servants with whom they are displeased to take off their shoes, hold out their feet to them with violence, as if they would thrust their feet against them.” The LXX. and Vulgate read, “will extend my shoe.” And Bishop Horne is of opinion, that the meaning is, “extending his shoe,” that is to say, putting his feet upon them; and this, it is well 				  known, was the manner in which Eastern conquerors were wont to treat their captives. But there is another ancient custom to which others suppose the passage refers. The ancients were wont to throw their shoes and sandals, when soiled with dirt, into some obscure corner before they sat down to meat, and many might possibly have some mean place in their houses into which they commonly threw them; and, therefore, the throwing of the shoe <i>over </i>or 				  <i>on </i>Edom might mean, as Bucer expounds it, “Edom will be as the place into which I cast my shoe.” But whatever may be the precise allusion, the meaning conveyed undoubtedly is, that David would make a complete conquest of Edom, that he would reduce it to the lowest subjection. And such was actually the case, as we learn from <a name="xxvi.ii-p22.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014">2Sa 8:14</a><a name="xxvi.ii-p22.4"></a>. “Abu Walid would have <a name="xxvi.ii-p22.5"></a>נעל here to signify <i>a fetter</i>, — ‘I will cast my fetter or chain on him:’ and so Kimchi, in his roots; though in his comment here he interpret it in the 				  notion of a shoe.” — <i>Hammond</i></p>

On this verse he observes: “it was a constant practice among the bravest nations of the Greeks, for the troops to advance to battle chanting some kind of song.” And, after quoting some lines which were sung by the Spartan soldiery, he adds, “The Grecian poet avails himself of the love of glory, and the ties of domestic affection, to animate his troops; but the Hebrew makes use of the more powerful stimulus of religious 				  enthusiasm.”</p>
