 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="v.vi-p8"></a><b>32.</b> <i>Ye shall observe to do therefore.</i> Again, in this verse also, he does not merely exhort the people to embrace the Law, but at the same time enjoins them to be content with its unadulterated teaching; and, in fact, to receive as just and right whatever God has commanded, is only to be half 			 obedient, unless men also put this restraint upon themselves, not to import anything else, (in addition to His Law.) So, also, in another passage, which I have subjoined, God no less severely forbids additions to it than taking away from it; and this is a declaration deserving our especial observation, because, in its preposterous wilfulness, the whole world almost is carried away into false religions; which, nevertheless, God has briefly condemned in a single word, when He commands His people 			 so to acquiesce in His appointed Law that they may not seek to be more righteous than they are taught to be. There is a similar passage at the end of <a name="v.vi-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032">De 12:32</a><a name="v.vi-p8.1"></a>,) but, because it is connected with a particular circumstance, and depends on the preceding passage, it will be more conveniently reserved for consideration in that place. He adds, in conclusion, that they will not 			 satisfy the Law unless they keep themselves within its bounds; and in order that they may be more disposed to obedience, he gently attracts them by subjoining the promise.   			  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">225</font></a>
