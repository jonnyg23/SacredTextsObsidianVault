 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.xv-p13"></a><b>6.</b> <i>And these words.</i> <a name="v.xv-p13.1"></a>In these four next verses God again commands (as before) the study of His Law. And first, indeed, He would have it implanted in their hearts, lest forgetfulness of it should ever steal over them; and by the word “heart” He designates the memory and other faculties of the 			 mind; as though He had said that this was so great a treasure, that there was good cause why they should hide it in their hearts, or so fix this doctrine deeply in their minds that it should never escape. Afterwards He enjoins that constant conversation should be held about it with their children, in order that fathers should diligently attend and apply themselves to the duty of instruction. The word <a name="v.xv-p13.2"></a>שנן   			  <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">234</font></a>
  			 <i> shanan, </i><a name="v.xv-p14.1"></a>which Moses uses, means properly “to <a name="v.xv-p14.2"></a>whet.” Commentators think that it is employed metaphorically for “to <a name="v.xv-p14.3"></a>reiterate,” or “to repeat constantly,” because, when the heavenly doctrine is inculcated, it will scarcely even thus be duly impressed on their hearts; but, since it is here used in the conjugation <i>Piel, 			 </i><a name="v.xv-p14.4"></a>its signification may be transitive, viz., that they should cause it to penetrate their minds, as if they should prick them with the point of a sword; for the other translation does not seem consistent. But it is sufficient for me to state my opinion, lest any should be offended by its novelty. Lastly, he exhorts them to exercise themselves in its meditation both publicly and privately, in order to stimulate their want of energy. But, although he may seem to speak 			 hyperbolically, yet if any one will carefully consider how slow and careless men are in learning, and how forgetful they are when they seem to have made some progress, he will readily acknowledge that Moses does not urge them so strongly on insufficient grounds, but that it was highly necessary for him to be thus rigid in exacting their attention. For this reason the Prophet in <a name="v.xv-p14.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002">Ps 1:2</a><a name="v.xv-p14.5"></a><a name="v.xv-p14.6"></a>, 			 pronounces them to be blessed who meditate in God’s law “day and night.” He leaves, then, no portion of time unoccupied with meditation on the Law; whether they are at home, or abroad, or when they retire to rest, or when they rise in the morning. To this precept David appears to allude in <a name="v.xv-p14.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#062">Ps 119:62</a><a name="v.xv-p14.7"></a><a name="v.xv-p14.8"></a>, where he says, “At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy 			 righteous judgments;” and again, <a name="v.xv-p14.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148">Ps 119:148</a><a name="v.xv-p14.9"></a><a name="v.xv-p14.10"></a>, “Mine <a name="v.xv-p14.11"></a>eyes prevent the night-watches, that I might meditate in thy word.” But still, by the expression “talk of them,” Moses does not urge the people to empty talkativeness, to which many are too much inclined, but he would have them severally thus establish themselves and be teachers of 			 each other. He enumerates these various engagements, lest that change of occupation by which the mind is wont to be distracted should withdraw the godly from the right path, as though he commanded them to make this their chief aim in whatever business they might be engaged. For the same reason he desires bracelets and frontlets to be made of the precepts of the Law, contrasting doubtless this spiritual ornament with chains   			  <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">235</font></a>
  			 <a name="v.xv-p15.1"></a> of gold, as much as to say that they would more properly take delight in the pious recollection of the Law, than in those trifling ornaments which attract men’s senses. The Jews understanding this literally, accounted this external ostentation a mark of holiness, so as to think that they had almost done all they needed, when they wore the Law on their arms and foreheads. Thence their mistaken zeal proceeded still further, so that, as each desired to be thought 			 better than others, they widened their phylacteries in proportion, for so they denominated the borders of their garments, on which were written certain sentences of the Law, as safeguards. This error our Lord severely reproves in the Scribes and Pharisees, (<a name="v.xv-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005">Mt 23:5</a><a name="v.xv-p15.2"></a><a name="v.xv-p15.3"></a>,) because it was a mere mockery of this admonition, and a profanation of its doctrine. The intention of God sufficiently 			 appears in the passage from Exodus, which I have subjoined, and in which they are simply commanded to be diligent in keeping the Law. But there is good reason why diligence should be required, not only on account of the matter being highly important, but because, through our vanity, we are apt to relax our exertions, unless our slowness of heart is stimulated.</p>
