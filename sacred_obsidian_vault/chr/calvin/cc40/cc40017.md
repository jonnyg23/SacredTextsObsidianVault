 <p><a name="xviii.i-p16"></a><b>1.</b> <i>It is not expedient for me to glory</i> Now, when as it were in the middle of the course, he restrains himself from proceeding farther, and in this way he most appropriately reproves the impudence of his rivals and declares that it is with reluctance, that he engages in this sort of contest with them. For what a shame it 			 was to scrape together from every quarter commendations, or rather to go a-begging for them, that they might be on a level with so distinguished a man! As to the latter, he admonishes them by his own example, that the more numerous and the more excellent the graces by which any one of us is distinguished, so much the less ought he to think of his own excellence. For such a thought is exceedingly dangerous, because, like one entering into a labyrinth, the person is immediately dazzled, so as to 			 be too quick-sighted in discerning his gifts,   			  <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">877</font></a>
  			  while in the mean time he is ignorant of himself. Paul is afraid, lest this should befall him. The graces conferred by God are, indeed, to be acknowledged, that we may be aroused, — <i>first</i>, to gratitude for them, and <i>secondly, </i>to the right improvement of them; but to take occasion from them to boast — <i>that </i>is what 			 cannot be done without great danger.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p18"></a><i>For I will come</i>   			  <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">878</font></a>
  			 <i> to visions.</i> “I shall not creep on the ground, but will be constrained to mount aloft. Hence I am afraid, lest the height of my gifts should hurry me on, so as to lead me to forget myself.” And certainly, if Paul had gloried ambitiously, he would have fallen headlong from a lofty eminence; for it is humility alone that can give stability to our greatness in the sight of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p20"></a>Between <i>visions</i> and <i>revelations</i> there is this distinction — that a <i>revelation </i>is often made either in a dream, or by an oracle, without any thing being presented to the eye, while a<i> 			 vision</i> is scarcely ever afforded without a <i>revelation, </i>or in other words, without the Lord’s discovering what is meant by it.   			  <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">879</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p23"></a><a name="xviii.i-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p24"></a><b>2.</b> <i>I knew a man in Christ</i> As he was desirous to restrain himself within bounds, he merely singles out <i>one </i>instance, and that, too, he handles in such a way as to show, that it is not from inclination that he brings it forward; for why does he speak in the person of another 			 rather than in his own? It is as though he had said, “I should have preferred to be silent, I should have preferred to keep the whole matter suppressed within my own mind, but those persons   			  <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">880</font></a>
  			  will not allow me. I shall mention it, therefore, as it were in a stammering way, that it may be seen that I speak through constraint.” Some think that the clause <i>in Christ</i> is introduced for the purpose of confirming what he says. I view it rather as referring to the disposition, so as to intimate that Paul has not here an eye to himself, 			 but looks to Christ exclusively.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p26"></a>When he confesses, that he does not know whether he was <i>in the body, </i>or <i>out of the body, </i>he expresses thereby the more distinctly the greatness of the revelation. For he means, that God dealt with him in such a way,   			  <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">881</font></a>
  			  that he did not himself understand the manner of it. Nor should this appear to us incredible, inasmuch as he sometimes manifests himself to us in such a way, that the manner of his doing so is, nevertheless, hid from our view.   			  <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">882</font></a>
  			  At the same time, this does not, in any degree, detract from the assurance of faith, which rests simply on this single point — that we are aware that God speaks to us. Nay more, let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to God. (<a name="xviii.i-p28.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029">De 29:29</a><a name="xviii.i-p28.2"></a>.) He says, then, 			 that he does not know, whether he was wholly taken up — soul and body — into heaven, or whether it was his soul only, that was <i>caught up</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p29"></a><i>Fourteen years ago</i> Some   			  <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">883</font></a>
  			  enquire, also, as to the place, but it does not belong to us to satisfy their curiosity.   			  <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">884</font></a>
  			  The Lord manifested himself to Paul in the beginning by a vision, when he designed to convert him from Judaism to the faith of the gospel, but he was not then admitted as yet into those secrets, as he needed even to be instructed by Ananias in the first rudiments.   			  <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">885</font></a>
  			  (<a name="xviii.i-p32.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012">Ac 9:12</a><a name="xviii.i-p32.2"></a>.) That vision, therefore, was nothing but a preparation, with the view of rendering him teachable. It may be, that, in this instance, he refers to that vision, of which he makes mention also, according to Luke’s narrative. (<a name="xviii.i-p32.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017">Ac 22:17</a><a name="xviii.i-p32.3"></a>.) There 			 is no occasion, however, for our giving ourselves much trouble as to these conjectures, as we see that Paul himself kept silence respecting it for fourteen years,   			  <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">886</font></a>
  			  and would not have said one word in reference to it, had not the unreasonableness of malignant persons constrained him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p34"></a><i>Even to the third heaven.</i> He does not here distinguish between the different heavens in the manner of the philosophers, so as to assign to each planet its own heaven. On the other hand, the number <i>three </i>is made use of (<a name="xviii.i-p34.2"></a>κατ ἐζοχὴν)<i> by way of eminence, </i>to denote what is highest and most complete. Nay more, the term <i>heaven, </i>taken by itself, denotes here the blessed and glorious kingdom of God, which is above all the spheres,   			  <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">887</font></a>
  			  and the firmament itself, and even the entire frame-work of the world. Paul, however, not contenting himself with the simple term,   			  <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">888</font></a>
  			  adds, that he had reached even the greatest height, and the innermost <i>recesses. </i>For our faith scales heaven and enters it, and those that are superior to others in knowledge get higher in degree and elevation, but to reach the <i>third heavens </i>has been granted to very few.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p37"></a><a name="xviii.i-p37.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p38"></a><b>4.</b> <i>In paradise</i>    			  <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">889</font></a>
  			  As every region that is peculiarly agreeable and delightful   			  <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">890</font></a>
  			  is called in the Scriptures the <i>garden of God, </i>it came from this to be customary among the Greeks to employ the term <i>paradise</i> to denote the heavenly glory, even previously to Christ’s advent, as appears from Ecclesiasticus. (<a name="xviii.i-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/sir040.htm#017">Sir. 40:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/apo/sir027.htm#000">Sir. 27:0</a><a name="xviii.i-p40.2"></a>.) It is also used in this sense in <a name="xviii.i-p40.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043">Lu 23:43</a><a name="xviii.i-p40.3"></a>, in Christ’s answer to the robber — “To-day shalt thou be with me in <i>paradise,</i>” that is, “Thou shalt enjoy the presence of God, in the condition and life 			 of the blessed.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p41"></a><i>Heard unspeakable words</i> By <i>words</i> here I do not understand <i>things, </i>as the term is wont to be made use of after the manner of the Hebrews;   			  <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">891</font></a>
  			  for the word <i>heard </i>would not correspond with this. Now if any one inquires, what they were, the answer is easy — that it is not without good reason that they are called <i>unspeakable</i>   			  <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">892</font></a>
  			  <i>words,</i> and such as it is unlawful to utter. Some one, however, will reply, that what Paul heard was, consequently, needless and useless, for what purpose did it serve to hear, what was to be buried in perpetual silence? I answer, that this took place for the sake of Paul himself, for one who had such arduous difficulties awaiting him, enough to break a thousand hearts, required to be 			 strengthened by special means, that he might not give way, but might persevere undaunted.   			  <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">893</font></a>
  			  Let us consider for a little, how many adversaries his doctrine had, and of what sort they were; and farther, with what a variety of artifices it was assailed, and then we shall wonder no longer, why he heard more than it was<i> lawful for him to utter</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p45"></a>From this, too, we may gather a most useful admonition as to setting bounds to knowledge. We are naturally prone to curiosity. Hence, neglecting altogether, or tasting but slightly, and carelessly, doctrine that tends to edification, we are hurried on to frivolous questions. Then there follow upon this — boldness and rashness, so that we do not hesitate to decide on matters unknown, and concealed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.i-p46"></a>From these two sources has sprung up a great part  			  <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">894</font></a>
  			 of scholastic theology, and every thing, which that trifler Dionysius  			  <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">895</font></a>
  			 has been so daring as to contrive in reference to the Heavenly Hierarchies, It becomes us so much the more to keep within bounds,  			  <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">896</font></a>
  			 so as not to seek to know any thing, but what the Lord has seen it good to reveal to his Church. Let this be the limit of our knowledge.</p>

 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p2"></a><b>6. </b>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <i>now</i> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <i>to be</i>, or <i>that</i> he heareth of me.</p>

 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p4"></a><b>7. </b>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>

 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p14"></a><b>6.</b> <i>For if I should desire.</i> Lest what he had said, as to his having no inclination to glory, should be turned into an occasion of calumny, and malevolent persons should reply — “You are not inclined for it, because it is not in your power, he anticipates such a reply. “I would have it quite in my power,” says he, “on good grounds; nor would I be justly accused of vanity, for I have ground to go upon, but I refrain from it.” He employs the term <i>folly </i>here in a different sense from what he had done previously, for even those that boast on good grounds act a silly and disgusting 			 part, if there appears any thing of boasting or ambition. The folly, however, is more offensive and insufferable, if any one boasts groundlessly, or, in other words, pretends to be what he is not; for in that case there is impudence in addition to silliness. The Apostle here proceeded upon it as a set, tied matter, that his glorying was as humble as it was well founded. Erasmus has rendered it — “I spare you,”   			  <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">897</font></a>
  			  but I prefer to understand it as meaning — “I refrain,” or, as I have rendered it, “I forbear.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p16"></a><i>Lest any one should think of me</i> He adds the reason — because he is contented to occupy the station, which God has assigned him. “My appearance,” says he, “and speech do not give promise of any thing illustrious in me: I have no objection, therefore, to be lightly esteemed.” Here we perceive what great modesty there was in this man, inasmuch as he was not at all concerned on account of his 			 meanness, which he <i>discovered </i>in his appearance and speech, while he was replenished with such a superiority of gifts. There would, however, be no inconsistency in explaining it in this way, that satisfied with the reality itself, he says nothing respecting himself, that he may thus reprove indirectly the false Apostles, who gloried in themselves as to many things, none of which were to be seen. What I mentioned first, however, is what I rather approve of.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.ii-p17"></a><a name="xviii.ii-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p18"></a><b>7.</b> <i>And lest through the superiority of revelations. </i>Here we have a <i>second </i>reason — that God, designing to repress in him every approach to insolence, subdued him with a rod. That rod he calls a <i>goad, </i>by a 			 metaphor taken from oxen. The word <i>flesh</i> is, in the Greek, in the dative   			  <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">898</font></a>
  			  Hence Erasmus has rendered it <i>“by </i>the flesh.” I prefer, however, to understand him as meaning, that the prickings of this <i>goad </i>were <i>in </i>his flesh.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p20"></a>Now it is asked, what this <i>goad </i>was. Those act a ridiculous part, who think that Paul was tempted to lust. We must therefore repudiate that fancy.  			  <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">899</font></a>
  			 Some have supposed, that he was harassed with frequent pains in the head. Chrysostom is rather inclined to think, that the reference is to Hymeneus and Alexander, and the like, because, instigated by the devil, they occasioned Paul very much annoyance. My opinion is, that under this term is comprehended every kind of temptation, with which Paul was exercised. For <i>flesh </i>here, in my opinion, denotes — not the body, but that part of the soul which has not yet been regenerated. 			 “There was given to me a <i>goad </i>that my flesh might be spurred up by it, for I am not yet so spiritual, as not to be exposed to temptations according to the flesh.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p22"></a>He calls it farther the <i>messenger of Satan</i> on this ground, that as all temptations are sent by Satan, so, whenever they assail us, they warn us that Satan is at hand. Hence, at every apprehension of temptation, it becomes us to arouse ourselves, and arm ourselves with promptitude for repelling Satan’s assaults. It was most profitable for Paul to 			 think of this, because this consideration did not allow him to exult like a man that was off his guard.   			  <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">900</font></a>
  			  For the man, who is as yet beset with dangers, and dreads the enemy, is not prepared to celebrate a triumph. “The Lord, says he, has provided me with an admirable remedy, against being unduly elated; for, while I am employed in taking care that Satan may not take advantage of me, I am kept back from pride.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p24"></a>At the same time, God did not cure him by this means exclusively, but also by humbling him. For he adds,<i> to buffet me;</i> by which expression he elegantly expresses this idea. — that he has been brought under control.   			  <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">901</font></a>
  			  For to be <i>buffeted </i>is a severe kind of indignity. Accordingly, if any one has had his face made black and blue,   			  <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">902</font></a>
  			  he does not, from a feeling of shame, venture to expose himself openly in the view of men. In like manner, whatever be the infirmity under which we labor, let us bear in mind, that we are, as it were, <i>buffeted by the Lord, </i>with the view of making us ashamed, that we may learn humility. Let this be carefully reflected upon by those, especially, who are otherwise distinguished by illustrious virtues, if they have any 			 mixture of defects, if they are persecuted by any with hatred, if they are assailed by any revilings — that these things are not merely <i>rods </i>of the Heavenly Master, but <i>buffetings, </i>to fill them with shame, and beat down all forwardness.   			  <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">903</font></a>
  			  Now let all the pious <i>take </i>notice as to this, that they may see   			  <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">904</font></a>
  			  how dangerous a thing the “poison of pride” is, as Augustine speaks in his third sermon “On the words of the Apostle,” inasmuch as it “cannot be cured except by poison.”   			  <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">905</font></a>
  			  And unquestionably, as it was the cause of man’s ruin, so it is the last vice with which we have to contend, for other vices have a connection with evil deeds, but <i>this </i>is to be dreaded in connection with the best actions; and farther, it naturally clings to us so obstinately, and is so deeply rooted, that it is extremely difficult to extirpate it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p30"></a>Let us carefully consider, who it is that here speaks — He had overcome so many dangers, tortures, and other evils — had triumphed over all the enemies of Christ — had driven away the fear of death — had, in fine, renounced the world; and yet he had not altogether subdued pride. Nay more, there awaited him a conflict so doubtful, that he could not overcome without being <i>buffeted. </i>Instructed by his example, let us wage war with other 			 vices in such a way, as to lay out our main efforts for the subduing of this one.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p31"></a>But what does this mean — that Satan, who was a</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xviii.ii-p32"></a>man-slayer   			  <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">906</font></a>

 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p34"></a>was a physician to Paul, and that too, not merely in the cure of the body, but — what is of greater importance — in the cure of the soul?

  			  He means, however, to intimate, that this annoyance had been felt by him distressing, inasmuch as he had so frequently prayed to be exempted from it. For if it had been slight, or <i>easy </i>to be endured, he would not have been so desirous to be freed from it; and yet he says that he had not obtained this: hence it appears, how much need he had of being humbled. He confirms, therefore, what he had said previously — that 			 he had, by means of this bridle, been held back from being haughty; for if relief from it had been for his advantage, he would never have met with a refusal.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p39"></a>It may seem, however, to follow from this, that Paul had not by any means prayed in faith, if we would not make void all the promises of God.  			  <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">909</font></a>
  			 “We read everywhere in Scripture, that we shall obtain whatever we ask in faith: Paul prays, and does not obtain.” I answer, that as there are different ways of asking, so there are different ways of obtaining. We ask in simple terms those things as to which we have an express promise — as, for example, the perfecting of God’s kingdom, and the <i>hallowing of his name, </i>(<a name="xviii.ii-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009">Mt 6:9</a><a name="xviii.ii-p40.2"></a>,) the 			 remission of our sins, and every thing that is advantageous to us; but, when we think that the kingdom of God <i>can, </i>nay <i>must </i>be advanced, in this particular manner, or in that, and that this thing, or that, is necessary for the <i>hallowing of his name, </i>we are often mistaken in our opinion. In like manner, we often fall into a serious mistake as to what tends to promote our own welfare. <i>Hence </i>we ask those former things confidently, and without any reservation, 			 while it does not belong to us to prescribe the means. If, however, we specify the means, there is always a condition implied, though not expressed. Now Paul was not so ignorant as not to know this. Hence, as to the <i>object </i>of his prayer, there can be no doubt that he was heard, although he met with a refusal as to the express <i>form. </i>By this we are admonished not to give way to despondency, as if our prayers had been lost labor, when God does not gratify or comply with our wishes, 			 but that we must be <i>satisfied with his grace, </i>that is, in respect of our not being forsaken by him. For the reason, why he sometimes mercifully refuses to his own people, what, in his wrath, he grants to the wicked, is this — that he foresees better what is expedient for us, than our understanding is able to apprehend.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.ii-p41"></a><a name="xviii.ii-p41.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p42"></a><b>9.</b> <i>He said to me.</i> It is not certain, whether he had this answer by a special revelation, and it is not of great importance.   			  <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">910</font></a>
  			  For God answers us, when he strengthens us inwardly by his Spirit, and sustains us by his consolation, so that we do not give up hope and patience. He bids Paul be <i>satisfied with his grace, </i>and, in the mean time, not refuse chastisement. Hence we must bear up under evil of ever so long continuance, because we are admirably well dealt with, when we have the grace of God to be our support. 			   			  <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">911</font></a>
  			  The term <i>grace, </i>here, does not mean here, as it does elsewhere, the favor of God, but by <i>metonymy, </i>the aid of the Holy Spirit, which comes to us from the unmerited favor of God; and it ought to be <i>sufficient </i>for the pious, inasmuch as it is a sure and invincible support against their ever giving way.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p45"></a><i>For my strength</i> Our weakness may seem, as if it were an obstacle in the way of God’s perfecting his strength in us. Paul does not merely deny this, but maintains, on the other hand, that it is only when our weakness becomes apparent, that God’s <i>strength</i> is duly <i>perfected. </i>To understand this more distinctly, we must distinguish between 			 God’s strength and ours; for the word <i>my</i> is emphatic. “<i>My </i>strength,” says the Lord, (meaning that which helps man’s need — which raises them up when they have fallen down, and refreshes them when they are faint,) “is perfected in the weakness of men;<i>” </i>that is, it has occasion to exert itself, when the weakness of men becomes manifest; and not only so, but it is more distinctly recognized as it ought to be. For the word <i>perfected 			 </i>has a reference to the perception and apprehension of mankind, because it is not <i>perfected </i>unless it openly shines forth, so as to receive its due praise. For mankind have no taste of it, unless they are first convinced of the need of it, and they quickly lose sight of its value, if they are not constantly exercised with a feeling of their own weakness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p46"></a><i>Most gladly, therefore</i> This latter statement confirms the exposition that I have given. <i>I will glory,</i> says he,<i> in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me</i>  			   			  <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">912</font></a>
  			  Hence, the man that is ashamed of this glorying, shuts the door upon Christ’s grace, and, in a manner, puts it away from him. For <i>then </i>do we make room for Christ’s grace, when in true humility of mind, we feel and confess our own weakness. The <i>valleys </i>are watered with rain to make them fruitful, while in the mean time, the high summits of the 			 lofty mountains remain dry.   			  <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">913</font></a>
  			  Let that man, therefore, become a <i>valley, </i>who is desirous to receive the heavenly rain of God’s spiritual grace.   			  <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">914</font></a>
  			</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p52"></a>He adds<i> most gladly, </i>to show that he is influenced by such an eager desire for the grace of Christ, that he refuses nothing for the sake of obtaining it. For we see very many yielding, indeed, submission to God, as being afraid of incurring sacrilege in coveting his glory, but, at the same time, not without reluctance, or 			 at least, less cheerfully than were becoming.   			  <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">915</font></a>

 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p55"></a><b>10.</b> <i>I take pleasure in infirmities</i> There can be no doubt, that he employs the term <i>weakness </i>in different senses; for he formerly applied this name to the punctures that he experienced in the flesh. He now employs it to denote those external qualities, which occasion 			 contempt in the view of the world. Having spoken, however, in a general way, of <i>infirmities</i> of every kind, he now returns to that particular description of them, that had given occasion for his turning aside into this general discourse. Let us take notice, then, that <i>infirmity </i>is a general term, and that under it is comprehended the weakness 			 of our nature, as well as all tokens of abasement. Now the point in question was Paul’s outward abasement. He proceeded farther, for the purpose of showing, that the Lord humbled him in every way, that, in his defects, the glory of God might shine forth the more resplendently, which is, in a manner, concealed and buried, when a man is in an elevated position. He now again returns to speak of his excellences, which, at the same time, made him contemptible in public view, instead of procuring for 			 him esteem and commendation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.ii-p56"></a><i>For when I am weak,</i> that is — “The more deficiency there is in me, so much the more liberally does the Lord, from his strength, supply me with whatever he sees to be needful for me.” For the fortitude of philosophers is nothing else than contumacy, or rather a mad enthusiasm, such as fanatics are accustomed to have. “If a man is desirous to be truly <i>strong, 			 </i>let him not refuse to be at the same time <i>weak</i> Let him,” I say, <i>“be weak </i>in himself that he may be <i>strong in the Lord.” </i>(<a name="xviii.ii-p56.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010">Eph 6:10</a><a name="xviii.ii-p56.1"></a>.) Should any one object, that Paul speaks here, not of a failure of strength, but of poverty, and other afflictions, I answer, that all these things are exercises for discovering to us our own weakness; for if God had 			 not exercised Paul with such trials, he would never have perceived so clearly his weakness. Hence, he has in view not merely poverty, and hardships of every kind, but also those effects that arise from them, as, for example, a feeling of our own weakness, self-distrust, and humility.</p>  <a name="xviii.iii"></a>

  			  For when the false Apostles calumniated Paul, they should have set themselves vigorously in opposition to them, and should have faithfully borne the testimony that was due to his excellences.

 <p><a name="xviii.iii-p17"></a><i>For in nothing</i> We are ungrateful to God, if we allow his gifts, of which we are witnesses, to be disparaged, or contemned.

  			  I have no fear, that I shall be found inferior.” For, although Paul was on the best of terms with all the Apostles, so that he was prepared to extol them above himself, he, nevertheless, contended against their names when falsely assumed.   			  <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>

  			  — that they were fully acquainted with all their institutions, and the like.

To busy themselves after this, as they did, 			 in pouring contempt upon him, what was this but to insult his modesty? Nay, what cruelty there was in it! Hence, it is not without good reason, that he sharply reproves pride so frantic. <i>Forgive me this wrong, </i>says he. For they were doubly ungrateful, inasmuch as they not only contemned the man, by whose acts of kindness they had been brought under obligation, but even turned 			 his kind disposition into an occasion of reproach. Chrysostom is of opinion, that there is no <i>irony </i>implied, and that, instead of this, there is an expression of apology; but, if any one examines the entire context more narrowly, he will easily perceive, that this gloss is quite foreign to Paul’s intention.</p>

 <p><a name="xviii.iii-p40"></a><i>I seek not yours.</i> It is the part of a genuine and upright pastor, not to seek to derive gain from his sheep, but to endeavor to promote their welfare; though, at the same time, it is to be observed, that men are not to be sought with the view of having   			  <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">931</font></a>
  			  every one his own particular followers.

Paul, however, means, that he is not 			 greedy of hire, but is concerned only for the welfare of souls. There is, however, still more of elegance in what he says, for it is as though he had said: “I am in quest of a larger hire than you think of. I am not contented with your wealth, but I seek to have you wholly, that I may present a sacrifice to the Lord of the fruits of my ministry.” But, what if one is supported by his labors?

  			  Unquestionably, if he is a faithful Pastor, he will always seek the welfare of the sheep — nothing else. His pay will, it is true, be an additional thing; but he ought to have no other aim, than what we have mentioned. Woe to those, that have an eye to any thing else!</p>

Was there no one of the other Apostles that was a <i>father, </i>inasmuch as the Churches ministered to their support? He did not by any means intend this; for it is no new thing for even parents to be supported by their children in their old age. Hence, those are not necessarily unworthy of the honor due to <i>fathers, </i>who live at the expense of the Church; but Paul simply wished to show 			 from the common law of nature, that what he had done proceeded from fatherly affection. This argument, therefore, ought not to be turned in a contrary direction.

What heart, though even as hard as iron, would such ardor of love not soften or break, especially in connection with such constancy?

 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p17"></a><b>16.</b> <i>But be it so.</i> These words intimate, that Paul had been blamed by malevolent persons, as though he had in a clandestine way procured, through means of hired persons, what he had refused to receive with his own hands   			  <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">934</font></a>
  			  — not that he had done any such thing, but they <i>“measure </i>others,” as they say, “by their own ell.”   			  <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">935</font></a>
  			  For it is customary for the wicked impudently to impute to the servants of God, whatever they would themselves do, if they had it in their power. Hence, Paul is constrained, with the view of clearing himself of a charge impudently fabricated,   			  <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">936</font></a>
  			  to defend the integrity of those whom he sent, for if they had committed any error, it would have been reckoned to his account. Now, who would be surprised at his being so cautious as to alms, when he had been harassed by such unfair judgments as to his conduct, after having made use of every precaution?   			  <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">937</font></a>
  			  Let his case, however, be a warning to us, not to look upon it as a thing that is new and intolerable, if at any time we find occasion to answer similar calumnies; but, more especially, let this be an admonition to us to use strict caution, not to furnish any handle to revilers. For we see, that it is not enough to give evidence of being ourselves upright, if those, whose assistance we have made use of, are not, 			 also, found to be so. Hence, our choice of them must not be made lightly, or as a matter of mere form, but with the utmost possible care.</p>

 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p23"></a><b>19.</b> <i>Do you again think.</i> As those that are conscious to themselves of something wrong are sometimes more anxious than others to clear themselves, it is probable, that this, also, was turned into a ground of calumny — that Paul had in the former Epistle applied himself to a defense of 			 his ministry. Farther, it is a fault in the servants of Christ, to be too much concerned as to their own reputation. With the view, therefore, of repelling those calumnies, he declares in the <i>first </i>place, that he speaks in the presence of God, whom evil consciences always dread. In the <i>second </i>place, he maintains, that he has not so much a <i>view </i>to 			 himself, as to them. He was prepared to go through <i>good report and bad report, </i>(<a name="xviii.iv-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008">2Co 6:8</a><a name="xviii.iv-p23.1"></a>,) nay, even to be reduced to nothing; but it was of advantage to the Corinthians, that he should retain the reputation that he deserved, that his ministry might not be brought into contempt.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.iv-p24"></a><a name="xviii.iv-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p25"></a><b>20.</b> <i>For I fear</i> He declares, in what way it tends to their edification, that his integrity should be vindicated, for, on the ground that he had <i>come </i>into contempt, many grew wanton, as it were, with loosened reins. Now respect for 			 him would have been a means of leading them to repentance<i>, </i>for they would have listened to his admonitions.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p26"></a><i>I fear,</i> says he. This <i>fear </i>proceeded from love, for, unless he had been concerned as to their welfare, he would very readily have overlooked all this, from which he sought to obtain no personal advantage. For 			 otherwise we are afraid to give occasion of offense, when we foresee that it will be hurtful to ourselves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p27"></a><i>And I shall be found by you.</i> Here is a <i>second </i>ground of fear — lest he should be constrained to act with greater severity. Now it is a token not merely of love, but even of indulgence, to shun severity, and have recourse to milder measures. “As to my striving at present to maintain my authority, and endeavoring to bring you back to obedience, I do this, lest I should find occasion to punish your obstinacy more severely, if I come, and find among you nothing of amendment.” He teaches, accordingly, by his example, that mild remedies must always be resorted to by Pastors, for the correction of faults, before they have recourse to extreme severity; and, at the same time, that 			 we must, by admonitions and reproofs, prevent the necessity of having recourse to the utmost rigor.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p28"></a><i>Lest, by any means, there be contentions.</i> He enumerates the vices, which chiefly prevailed among the Corinthians; almost all of which proceeded from the same source. For had not every one been devoted to self, they would never have contended with each other — they would never have envied one another — there would have been no 			 slandering among them.   			  <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">938</font></a>
  			  Thus the sum and substance of the first catalogue   			  <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">939</font></a>
  			  is want of love, because (<a name="xviii.iv-p30.2"></a>φιλαυτία) self-love<i>,</i>   			  <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">940</font></a>
  			  and ambition prevailed.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.iv-p32"></a><a name="xviii.iv-p32.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p33"></a><b>21.</b> <i>Lest, when I come, my God should humble me</i> His abasement was reckoned to him as a fault. The blame of it he throws back upon the Corinthians, who, when they should have honored his Apostleship, loaded it, on the contrary, with disgrace; for their proficiency   			  <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">941</font></a>
  			  would have been the glory and honor of Paul’s Apostleship. When, therefore, they were, instead of this, overrun with many vices, they heaped disgrace upon him to the utmost of their power. He does not, indeed, charge them all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently despised all his admonitions. The meaning, then, is this: “They think contemptuously of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then, 			 give me no occasion of abasement: nay more, let them, on the contrary, laying aside their forwardness, begin to feel shame; and let them, confounded at their iniquities, prostrate themselves on the ground, instead of looking down upon others with disdain.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xviii.iv-p35"></a>In the mean time, he lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine Pastor, when he says that he will look upon the sins of others with grief. And, undoubtedly, the right way of acting is this — that every Christian shall have his Church inclosed within his heart, and be affected with its maladies, as if they were his own, — sympathize with its sorrows, and bewail its sins. We see, how Jeremiah entreats, that there may be given him <i>a 			 fountain of tears, </i>(<a name="xviii.iv-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001">Jer 9:1</a><a name="xviii.iv-p35.1"></a>,) that he may bewail the calamity of his people. We see, how pious kings and prophets, to whom the government of the people was committed, were touched with similar feelings. It is, indeed, a thing that is common to all the pious, to be grieved in every case in which God is offended, and to bewail the ruin of brethren, and present themselves before God in their room as in a 			 manner guilty, but it is more particularly requisite on the part of Pastors.  			  <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">942</font></a>
  			 Farther, Paul here brings forward a second catalogue of vices, which, however, belong to one general head — unchastity.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xviii.i-p48"></a> Calvin refers here to one Dionysius, whose writings appear to have been looked upon by many in Calvin’s times, as having been composed by Dionysius the Areopagite, who was converted by Paul at Athens. (<a name="xviii.i-p48.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034">Ac 17:34</a><a name="xviii.i-p48.2"></a>.) A copy of the work referred to, printed at Paris in 1555, bears the following title: “<a name="xviii.i-p48.3"></a>S. Dionysii Areopagitae, Martyris Inclyti, Athenarum Episcopi, et Galliarum Apostoli, opera-Translatio Noua Ambrosii Florentini,” <i>etc</i>.; — “The works of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, the renowned Martyr, Bishop of 				  Athens, and Apostle of the Gauls — a New Translation by Ambrosius Florentine,” etc. — Calvin, in his Institutes, (volume 1,) when treating of angels, adverts to the writings of Dionysius, in the following terms: “None can deny that Dionysius (whoever he may have been) has many shrewd and subtle disquisitions in his Celestial Hierarchy, but on looking at them more closely, every one must see that they are merely idle talk. The duty of a 				  theologian, however, is not to tickle the ear, but confirm the conscience, by teaching what is true, certain, and useful. When you read the work of Dionysius, you would think that the man had come down from heaven, and was relating, not what he had learned, but what he had actually seen. Paul, however, though he was carried to the third heaven, so far from delivering any thing of the kind positively, declares, that it was not lawful for man to speak the secrets which he had seen. Bidding adieu, 				  therefore, to that nugatory wisdom, let us endeavor to ascertain from the simple doctrine of Scripture, what it is the Lord’s pleasure that we should know concerning angels.” — <i>Beza, </i>in his Annotations on <a name="xviii.i-p48.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015">1Co 3:15</a><a name="xviii.i-p48.4"></a>, when expounding the expression — “he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire,” makes mention of 				  Dionysius, as having been, in his opinion, Bishop of Corinth, and speaks of him as having devoted himself to unprofitable speculations, and as harassing himself, for the most part in vain, in describing the Celestial Hierarchy. — The Rhemish Translators, when commenting on <a name="xviii.i-p48.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034">Ac 17:34</a><a name="xviii.i-p48.5"></a>, contend for the genuineness of the writings referred to. “<a name="xviii.i-p48.6"></a><i>Dionysius Areopaita</i> This is that famous Denys that first converted France, and wrote those notable and divine works — ’<a name="xviii.i-p48.7"></a>De Ecclesiastica et Caelesti Hierarchia, de diuinis nominibus,’ and others; in which he confirmeth, and proveth plainely, almost all things that the Church now useth in the 				  ministration of the Holy Sacrament, and affirmeth that he learned them of the Apostles, giving also testimony for the Catholike faith in most things now controuersed, so plainely that our adversaries have no shift but to deny this Denys to have been the author of them, raining that they be another’s of later age.” To these statements Dr. Fulke, in his elaborate work in refutation of the errors of the Rhemish Translators, (p. 403,) replies as follows: “That Dionysius Areopagita was author of 				  those bookes which now beare his name, you bring no proofe at all. We alleage that Eusebius, Hierome, Gennadius, neuer heard of his writings, for if they had heard, Dionysius Areopagita should have been registered by them among ecclesiasticall writers.” — It is stated by <i>Mosheim </i>in his Ecclesiastical History, (London 1825,) volume 2, <i>n. </i>(<i>u</i>)<i>, </i>that “<i>the </i>spuriousness of these works is now universally granted by the most learned and impartial of the Roman Catholic writers, as they contain accounts of many events that happened several ages after the time of Dionysius, and were not at all mentioned until after the fifth century.” <i>Turretine </i>in his Theology brings forward, at 				  considerable length, evidence to show, that the work referred to was not, as pretended, the production of Dionysius the Areopagite, who was “<a name="xviii.i-p48.8"></a>σύγχρονος Apostolis,” (“a contemporary of the Apostles,”) but was written by an author of much later date — born in the fifth <i>century.</i> — <i>Turretini </i>Theologia, (Genevae, 1690,) tom. 3, pp. 233, 234. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xviii.ii-p33"></a> Dr. Campbell, in his Translation of the Gospels, makes use of the term <i>manslayer, </i>as Calvin does here, and makes the following observations in support of this rendering: “The common term for <i>murderer </i>in the New Testament is <a name="xviii.ii-p33.1"></a>φονεὺς. I have here made choice of a less usual name, not from any disposition to trace etymologies, but because I think it is not without intention, that the devil, as being not of earthly extraction, is rather called <a name="xviii.ii-p33.2"></a>ἀνθρωποκτόνος than <a name="xviii.ii-p33.3"></a>φονεὺς, as marking, with greater precision, his ancient enmity to the human race. When the name <i>murderer </i>is applied to a rational being of a species different from ours, it naturally suggests, that the being so denominated is a destroyer of others of his own species. As this is not meant here, the Evangelist’s term is peculiarly apposite. At the same time, I am sensible, that our word <i>manslaughter </i>means, in the language of the law, such killing as is, indeed, criminal, though not so atrocious as murder. But, in common use, it is not so limited. Heylyn says, to the same purpose — a <i>slayer of men.</i>” — <i>Campbell </i>on the Gospels, (Edin. 1807,) volume 2. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xviii.iv-p18"></a> “This passage is so far from being friendly to the exercise of guile, that it is a manifest disavowal of it. It is an <i>irony. </i>The Apostle does not describe what had actually been his conduct, but that of which he stood accused by the Corinthian teachers. They insinuated, that he was a sly, crafty man, going about preaching, persuading, and catching people with guile. Paul acknowledges, that he and his colleagues 				  did, indeed, ‘persuade men,’ and could not do otherwise, for ‘the love of Christ constrained them.’ (<a name="xviii.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011">2 Cor. 5:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014">14</a><a name="xviii.iv-p18.1"></a>.) But he indignantly repels the insinuation of its being from mercenary motives. ‘We have wronged no man,’ says he, ‘we have corrupted no man; we have defrauded no man.’ (<a name="xviii.iv-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002">2Co 7:2</a><a name="xviii.iv-p18.2"></a>.) Having denied the charge, he shows the <i>absurdity </i>of it. Mercenary men, who wish to draw people after them, have an <i>end </i>to answer: and ‘What end,’ says Paul, ‘could I have in view, in <i>persuading </i>you to embrace the gospel? Have I gained any thing by you? When I was with you, was I burdensome to you? No: nor, as things are, will I be burdensome. <i>Yet being crafty, </i>forsooth, <i>I caught you with guile.</i>’” — <i>Fuller’ s Works, </i>volume 3. 				  — Ed.</p>
