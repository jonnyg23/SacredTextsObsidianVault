 <p><a name="xvii.i-p5"></a><b>2. </b>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i>you as </i>a chaste virgin to Christ.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.i-p15"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p16"></a><a name="xvii.i-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p17"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Would that ye did bear with me.</i> As he saw that the ears of the Corinthians were still in part pre-engaged,   			  <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">793</font></a>
  			  he has recourse to another contrivance, for he turns to express a wish, as persons do when they do not venture openly to entreat.   			  <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">794</font></a>
  			  Immediately afterwards, however, as if gathering confidence, he nevertheless entreats the Corinthians to bear with his<i> folly</i>. He gives the name of <i>folly</i> to that splendid proclamation of his praises, which afterwards follows. Not as if he were a fool in glorying; for he was constrained to it by necessity, 			 and besides, he restrained himself in such a manner, that no one could justly regard him as going beyond bounds; but as it is an unseemly thing to herald one’s own praises, and a thing that is foreign to the inclinations of a modest man, he speaks by way of concession.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p20"></a>What I have rendered in the imperative — <i>bear with me, </i>Chrysostom interprets as an affirmation, and certainly the Greek word is ambiguous, and either sense suits sufficiently well. As, however, the reasons that the Apostle subjoins are designed to induce the Corinthians to <i>bear with him, </i>and as we will find him afterwards expostulating with them again on the ground of their not conceding anything to him, I have followed the Old Interpreter.   			  <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">795</font></a>
  			  By saying, <i>Would that, </i>etc., he had seemed to be distrustful; <i>now, </i>as if correcting that hesitation, he openly and freely commands.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p22"></a><a name="xvii.i-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p23"></a><b>2.</b> <i>For I am jealous</i> Mark why it is that he acts the fool, for <i>jealousy</i> hurries a man as it were headlong. “Do not demand that I should show the equable temper   			  <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">796</font></a>
  			  of a man that is at ease, and not excited by any emotion, for that vehemence of vehemence of jealousy, with which I am inflamed towards you, does not suffer me to be at ease.” As, however, there are two kinds of jealousy — the one springs from self love, and of a wicked and perverse nature, while the other is cherished by us on God’s account,   			  <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">797</font></a>
  			  he intimates of what sort his zeal is. For many are zealous — for themselves, not for God. <i>That</i> on the other hand, is the only pious and right zeal, that has an eye to God, that he may not be defrauded of the honors that of right belong to him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p26"></a><i>For I have united you to one man.</i> That his zeal was of such a nature, he proves from the design of his preaching, for its tendency was to join them to Christ in marriage, and retain them in connection with him.   			  <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">798</font></a>
  			  Here, however, he gives us in his own person a lively picture of a good minister; for One alone is the Bridegroom of the Church — the Son of God. All ministers are the <i>friends of the Bridegroom, </i>as the Baptist declares respecting himself. (<a name="xvii.i-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029">Joh 3:29</a><a name="xvii.i-p27.2"></a>.) Hence all ought to be concerned, that the fidelity of this 			 sacred marriage remain unimpaired and inviolable. This they cannot do, unless they are actuated by the dispositions of the Bridegroom, so that every one of them may be as much concerned for the purity of the Church, as a husband is for the chastity of his wife. Away then with coldness and indolence in this matter, for one that is cold   			  <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">799</font></a>
  			  will never be qualified for this office. Let them, however, in the mean time, take care, not to pursue their own interest rather than that of Christ, that they may not intrude themselves into his place, lest while they give themselves out as his <i>paranymphs,</i>   			  <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">800</font></a>
  			  they turn out to be in reality adulterers, by alluring the bride to love themselves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p30"></a><i>To present you as a chaste virgin.</i> We are married to Christ, on no other condition than that we bring virginity as our dowry, and preserve it entire, so as to be free from all corruption. Hence it is the duty of ministers of the gospel to purify our souls, that they may be <i>chaste virgins to 			 Christ; </i>otherwise they accomplish nothing. Now we may understand it as meaning, that they individually present themselves as<i> chaste virgins to Christ,</i> or that the minister presents the whole of the people, and brings them forward into Christ’s presence. I approve rather of the second interpretation. Hence I have given a different rendering from Erasmus.   			  <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">801</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p32"></a><a name="xvii.i-p32.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p33"></a><b>3.</b> <i>But I fear</i> He begins to explain, what is the nature of that <i>virginity </i>of which he has made mention — our cleaving to Christ alone, sincerely, with our whole heart. God, indeed, everywhere requires from us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit, and he warns us 			 that he is a <i>jealous God, </i>(<a name="xvii.i-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Ex 20:5</a><a name="xvii.i-p33.1"></a>,) to avenge with the utmost severity the wrong done to him, in the event of any one’s drawing back from him. This connection, however, is accomplished in Christ, as Paul teaches in Ephesians, (<a name="xvii.i-p33.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025">Eph. 5:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027">27</a><a name="xvii.i-p33.2"></a>.) He points out, however, at present the means of it — when we remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for, as in contracting marriages among men, there are written contracts   			  <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">802</font></a>
  			  drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and the Son of God is confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written contract.   			  <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">803</font></a>
  			  Let us maintain the fidelity, love, and obedience, that have been there promised by us; he will be faithful to us on his part.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p36"></a>Now Paul says that he is concerned, that the minds of the Corinthians may not be <i>corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ</i> Paul, it is true, says in Greek <a name="xvii.i-p36.1"></a>εἰς Χριστόν<i>, </i>which Erasmus renders <i>towards Christ,</i>   			  <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">804</font></a>
  			  but the Old Interpreter has come nearer, in my opinion, to Paul’s intention,   			  <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">805</font></a>
  			  because by the <i>simplicity that is in Christ</i> is meant, that which keeps us in the unadulterated and pure doctrine of the gospel, and admits of no foreign admixtures   			  <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">806</font></a>
  			  By this he intimates that men’s minds are <i>adulterated,</i>   			  <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">807</font></a>
  			  whenever they turn aside, even in the least degree, to the one side or to the other, from the pure doctrine of Christ. Nor is it without good reason, for who would not condemn a matron as guilty of unchastity, so soon as she lends an ear to a seducer? So in like manner we, when we admit wicked and false teachers, who are Satan’s vile agents, show but too clearly, that we do not maintain conjugal fidelity towards Christ. We must also take 			 notice of the term <i>simplicity,</i> for Paul’s fear was not, lest the Corinthians should all at once openly draw back altogether from Christ, but lest, by turning aside, by little and little, from the simplicity which they had learned, so as to go after profane and foreign contrivances, they should at length become adulterated.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p41"></a>He brings forward a comparison <i>as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty</i> For if false teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any power of eloquence for persuading, if they plausibly insinuate themselves into the minds of their hearers, and instill their poison by fawning artifices, it was in a similar way that Satan also <i>beguiled Eve, </i>as he did not openly 			 declare himself to be an enemy, but crept in privily under a specious pretext.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p42"></a><a name="xvii.i-p42.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p43"></a><b>4.</b> <i>For if he that cometh.</i> He now reproves the Corinthians for the excessive readiness, which they showed to receive the false apostles. For while they were towards Paul himself excessively morose and irritable,   			  <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">808</font></a>
  			  so that on any, even the least occasion, they were offended if he gave them even the slightest reproof, there was, on the other hand, nothing that they did not bear with, on the part of the false Apostles. They willingly endured their pride, haughtiness, and unreasonableness. An absurd reverence of this nature he condemns, because in the mean time they showed no discrimination or judgment. “How is it that they 			 take   			  <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">809</font></a>
  			  so much liberty with you, and you submit patiently to their control? Had they brought you another Christ, or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from what you received through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for them, for they would be deserving of such honor. But as they have conferred upon you nothing, that I had not given you previously, what sort of gratitude do you show in all but adoring those, to whom you are indebted for nothing, 			 while you despise me, through whom God has bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished benefits?” Such is the reverence that is shown even at this day by Papists towards their pretended Bishops. For while they are oppressed by their excessively harsh tyranny,   			  <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">810</font></a>
  			  they submit to it without difficulty; but, at the same time, do not hesitate to treat Christ himself with contempt.   			  <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">811</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p48"></a>The expressions — <i>another Christ, </i>and <i>another gospel, </i>are made use of here in a different sense from what they bear in <a name="xvii.i-p48.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Ga 1:8</a><a name="xvii.i-p48.1"></a>. For <i>another</i> is used there in opposition to what is true and genuine, and hence it means <i>false </i>and <i>counterfeit. </i>Here, on the other hand, he means to say — “If the gospel had come to you through their ministry, and not through mine.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p49"></a><a name="xvii.i-p49.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p50"></a><b>5.</b> <i>For I reckon that I am.</i> He now convicts them of ingratitude, by removing the only thing that could serve as an excuse for them, for he shows that he is on a level, even with the chief of the Apostles. The Corinthians, therefore, were ungrateful   			  <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">812</font></a>
  			  in not esteeming him more highly, after having found him, by experience, to be such; while, on the other hand, the authority that was justly due to him, they transferred to persons of no value. For the sake of modesty, however, he says that he <i>reckons </i>so, while the thing was known and manifest to all. His meaning, however, is, that God had honored his Apostleship with no less distinguished marks of favor, than that 			 of John or Peter. Now the man that despises the gifts of God, which he himself recognizes, cannot clear himself from the charge of being spiteful and ungrateful. Hence, wherever you see the gifts of God, you must there reverence God himself:   			  <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">813</font></a>
  			  I mean, that every one is worthy of honor, in so far as he is distinguished by graces received from God, and especially if any advantage has redounded to thee from them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p53"></a><a name="xvii.i-p53.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p54"></a><b>6.</b> <i>But though I am rude</i> There was one thing   			  <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">814</font></a>
  			  in which he might appear, at first view, to be inferior — that he was devoid of eloquence. This judgment,   			  <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">815</font></a>
  			  therefore, he anticipates and corrects, while he <i>acknowledges </i>himself, indeed, to be <i>rude</i> and unpolished <i>in speech, </i>while at the same time he maintains that he has <i>knowledge</i>  By <i>speech</i> here he means, elegance of expression; and by <i>knowledge</i> he means, the very substance of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a body, so also in doctrine, there is the thing itself that is taught, and the ornament of expression with 			 which it is clothed. Paul, therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of expression.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p57"></a>It is asked, however, whether elegance of <i>speech</i>   			  <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">816</font></a>
  			  is not also necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared for teaching? <i>Knowledge</i> might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a teacher be dumb? I answer, that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be <i>rude in speech, </i>it is not as though he were a mere infant, but as 			 meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid eloquence as others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for himself what was the principal thing — the reality itself,   			  <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">817</font></a>
  			  while he leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should inquire, why it is that the Lord, <i>who made men’s tongues, </i>(<a name="xvii.i-p59.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011">Ex 4:11</a><a name="xvii.i-p59.2"></a>,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that nothing might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a <i>sufficiency </i>for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel, what majesty there is in his writings, what elevation appears in them, what a weight of meaning is couched under them, what power is discovered in them. In fine, they are thunderbolts, not mere words. Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more clearly in a naked rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of elegance and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have 			 treated more largely in the former Epistle.   			  <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">818</font></a>
  			  In short, he admits, as far as words are concerned, what his adversaries allege by way of objection, while he denies in reality what they hold forth. Let us also learn, from his example, to prefer deeds to words, and, to use a barbarous but common proverb — “<a name="xvii.i-p60.2"></a>Teneant alii quid <i>nominis, </i>nos autem quid <i>rei</i>;” — “Let others know something of the <i>name, </i>but let us know something of the <i>reality.</i>”   			  <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">819</font></a>
  			  If eloquence is superadded, let it be regarded by us as something over and above; and farther, let it not be made use of for disguising doctrine, or adulterating it, but for unfolding it in its genuine simplicity.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p62"></a><i>But everywhere.</i> As there was something magnificent in placing himself on a level with the chief Apostles, that this may not be ascribed to arrogance, he makes the Corinthians judges, provided they judge from what they have themselves experienced; for they had known sufficiently well, from many proofs, that he did not boast needlessly, 			 or without good reason. He means, therefore, that he needs not make use of words, inasmuch as reality and experience afford clear evidence of every thing that he was about to say   			  <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">820</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p18"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Have I committed an offense?</i> His humility was cast up to him by way of reproach, while it was an excellence that was deserving of no ordinary commendation. <i>Humility </i>here means — voluntary abasement; for in conducting himself modestly, as if he had nothing in him that was 			 particularly excellent, so that many looked upon him as one of the common people, he had done that for the advantage of the Corinthians. For the man was inflamed with so great a desire,   			  <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">823</font></a>
  			  and so great an anxiety for their salvation, that he made a regard to himself a secondary consideration. Hence he says, that he had of his own accord made a surrender of his own greatness, that they might become great through his abasement. For his design was, that he might promote their salvation. He now indirectly charges them with ingratitude, in imputing to him as a fault so pious a disposition — not indeed for the purpose of reproaching him, but with the view 			 of restoring them so much the better to a sound mind. And certainly, he wounded them more severely by speaking <i>ironically, </i>than if he had spoken in a simple way, and without a figure. He might have said, “What is this? Am I despised by you, because I have lowered myself for your advantage?” The questioning, however, which he makes use of, was more forcible for putting them to shame.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p20"></a><i>Because I preached freely</i> This is a part of his abasement. For he had given up his own right, as though his condition had been inferior to that of others; but such was the unreasonableness of some of them, that they esteemed him the less on that account, as if he had been undeserving of remuneration. The reason, why he had given his services to the Corinthians 			 gratuitously, is immediately subjoined — for he did not act in this manner everywhere, but, as we have seen in the former Epistle,   			  <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">824</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p23"></a><b>8.</b> <i>I robbed other churches</i> He has intentionally, in my opinion, made use of an offensive term, that he might the more forcibly express the unreasonableness of the matter — in respect of his being despised by the Corinthians. “I have,” says he, 			 “procured pay for myself from the <i>spoils </i>of others, that I might serve you. While I have thus spared you, how unreasonable it is to make me so poor a return!” It is, however, a metaphor, that is taken from what is customary among soldiers; for as conquerors take <i>spoils </i>from the nations that they 			 have conquered, so every thing that Paul took from the Churches that he had gained to Christ was, in a manner, the <i>spoils </i>of his victories, though, at the same time, he never would have taken it from persons against their will, but what they contributed gratuitously was, in a manner, due by right of spiritual warfare.   			  <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>

Accordingly he does not say, that his living had been furnished to him by the Macedonians,   			  <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">826</font></a>
  			  but merely that they had supplied what was wanting. We have spoken elsewhere of the Apostle’s holy prudence and diligence in providing against dangers. Here we must take notice of the pious zeal of the Macedonians, who did not hesitate to contribute of their substance for his pay, that the gospel might be proclaimed to others, and those, too, that were wealthier than themselves. Ah! how few <i>Macedonians 			 </i>are there in the present day, and on the other hand how many <i>Corinthians </i>you may find everywhere!</p>

For this manner of expression — <i>the truth of Christ is in me,</i> is in the form of oath. Let me not be thought to have the <i>truth of Christ</i> in me if I do not retain this glorying among the inhabitants of Achaia.

  			  he asks, as it were in their name, whether this is a token of a malevolent mind?

  			  The false Apostles, with the view of alluring to themselves ignorant persons, took no pay. Their serving gratuitously was a show of uncommon zeal.   			  <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">832</font></a>
  			  If Paul had availed himself of his right, he would have given them occasion to raise their crest, as if they had been greatly superior to him. Paul, accordingly, that he might give them no occasion of doing injury, did himself, also, preach the Gospel, free of charge, and this is what he adds — that he is desirous to <i>cut off occasion from those that desire occasion</i> For the false Apostles 			 were desirous to insinuate themselves by this artifice, and to detract, in proportion to this, from Paul’s credit, if they were superior to him in any respect. He says, that he will not give them this advantage. “They will be found,” says he, “on a level with us in that glorying which they would wish to have for themselves exclusively.” This, however, is a useful admonition in connection with cutting off occasion from the wicked, as often as they desire one. For this is the only way to overcome 			 them — not in the way of furnishing them with arms through our imprudence.   			  <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">833</font></a>

It was apparently a laudable thing 			 to despise money, but he says, that they make use of a pretense for the purpose of deceiving, exactly as if a harlot were to borrow the apparel of a decent matron. For it was necessary to pull off the mask, which obscured the glory of God.</p>

  			  Hence they require to be carefully and thoroughly sifted, lest we should receive persons as servants of Christ, as soon as any appearance of excellence is discovered. Nor does Paul in malice and envy put an unfavorable construction upon what might be looked upon as an excellence, but, constrained by their dishonesty, he unfolds to view the evil that lay hid, because there was a dangerous profanation of virtue in pretending to burn with greater zeal than all the 			 servants of Christ.</p>

For he would lose his object, if we were made aware of his being a mortal enemy, and opposer of our salvation. Hence he always makes use of some cloak for the purpose of insnaring us, and does not immediately <i>show his horns, </i>(as the common expression is,) but rather makes it his endeavor to appear as an<i> 			 angel</i> Even when he tempts us to gross crimes, he makes use, nevertheless, of some pretext that he may draw us, when we are off our guard, into his nets. What then, if he attacks us under the appearance of good, nay, under the very title of God? His life-guards imitate, as I have said, the same artifice. These are golden preambles — “Vicar of Christ” — “Successor of 			 Peter” — “Servant of God’s servants,” but let the masks be pulled off, and who and what will the Pope be discovered to be? Scarcely will Satan himself, his master, surpass so accomplished a scholar in any kind of abomination. It is a well known saying as to Babylon, that she gives poison to drink in a golden cup.

 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p16"></a><b>16.</b> <i>I say again</i> The Apostle has a twofold design. He has it partly in view to expose the disgusting vanity of the false Apostles, inasmuch as they were such extravagant trumpeters of their own praises; and farther, to expostulate with the Corinthians, because they shut him up to the necessity of glorying, contrary to the 			 inclinations of his own mind. “<i>I say again,”</i> says he. For he had abundantly shown previously, that there was no reason, why he should be despised. He had also shown at the same time, that he was very unlike others, and therefore ought not to have his grounds of glorying estimated according to the rule of their measure. Thus he again shows, for what purpose he had hitherto gloried — that he might clear his apostleship 			 from contempt; for if the Corinthians had done their duty, he would not have said one word as to this matter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p17"></a><i>Otherwise now as a fool</i> “If I am reckoned by you a <i>fool, </i>allow me at least to make use of my right and liberty — that is, to speak foolishly after the manner of fools.” Thus he reproves the false Apostles, who, while they were exceedingly silly in this respect,<i> 			 </i>were not merely borne with by the Corinthians, but were received with great applause. He afterwards explains what kind of folly it is — the publishing of his own praises. While they did so without end and without measure, he intimates that it was a thing to which he was unaccustomed; for he says, <i>for a little while</i> For I take this clause as referring to time, so that the meaning is, that Paul did not wish to continue it long, but assumed, as it were, for the moment, the person of another, and immediately thereafter laid it aside, as we are accustomed to pass over lightly those things that are foreign to our object, while fools occupy themselves constantly (<a name="xvii.iv-p17.1"></a>ἐν παρέργοις)   			  <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">837</font></a>

  			  might seem unsuitable to a servant of the Lord. At the same time, the things that Paul confesses respecting himself, he, on the other hand, condemns in the false Apostles.   			  <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">839</font></a>

Are not they my leaders? Am I alone, or am I the first, in <i>glorying according to the flesh? </i>Why should that be reckoned praiseworthy in <i>them, </i>that is imputed to me as a fault?” So far then is Paul from ambition in recounting his own praises, that he is contented to be blamed on that account, provided he exposes the vanity of the false apostles.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p28"></a><i>To glory after the flesh, </i>is to boast one’s self, rather in what has a tendency towards show, than in a good conscience. For the term <i>flesh, </i>here, has a reference to the world — when we seek after praise from outward masks, which have a showy appearance before the world, and are regarded as excellent. In 			 place of this term he had a little before made use of the expression — <i>in appearance. </i>(<a name="xvii.iv-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007">2Co 10:7</a><a name="xvii.iv-p28.1"></a>.)</p>

  			  He says, therefore — “Since you are so wise, act the part of wise men in bearing with me, whom you treat with contempt, as you would a <i>fool.”</i> Hence I infer, that this discourse is not addressed to all indiscriminately, but some particular persons are reproved, who conducted themselves in an unkind manner.   			  <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">844</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p34"></a><b>20.</b> <i>For ye bear with it, if any one.</i> There are <i>three </i>ways in which this may be understood. He may be understood as reproving the Corinthians in <i>irony, </i>because they could not endure any 			 thing, as is usually the case with effeminate persons; or he charges them with indolence, because they had given themselves up to the false Apostles in a disgraceful bondage; or he repeats, as it were, in the person of another, what was spitefully affirmed respecting himself,   			  <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">845</font></a>
  			  as if he claimed for himself a tyrannical authority over them. The <i>second </i>meaning is approved by Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Augustine, and hence it is commonly received; and, indeed, it corresponds best with the context, although the <i>third </i>is not less in accordance with my views. For we see, how he was calumniated from time to time by the malevolent, as if he domineered 			 tyrannically, while he was very far from doing so. As, however, the other meaning is more generally received, I have no objection, that it should be held as the true one.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p36"></a>Now this statement will correspond with the preceding one in this way: “You bear with every thing from others, if they oppress you, if they demand what belongs to you, if they treat you disdainfully. Why then will you not bear with me, as they are in no respect superior to me?” For as to his saying that he is not <i>weak, </i>he means that he had been endowed by God with such excellent graces, that he ought not to be looked 			 upon as of the common order. For the word <i>weak </i>has a more extensive signification, as we shall see again ere long.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p37"></a>It has been the invariable custom, and will be so to the end, to resist contumaciously  			  <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">846</font></a>
  			 the servants of God, to get enraged on the least occasion,  			  <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">847</font></a>
  			 to grumble and murmur incessantly, to complain of even a moderate strictness,  			  <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">848</font></a>
  			 to hold all discipline in abhorrence; while, on the other hand, they put themselves under servile subjection to false apostles, impostors, or mere worthless pretenders, give them liberty to do any thing whatever, and patiently submit to and endure, whatever burden they may choose to impose upon them. Thus, at the present day, you will scarcely find one in thirty, who will put his neck willingly under Christ’s yoke, while all have endured with patience a tyranny so severe as that of 			 the Pope. Those very persons are all at once in an uproar,  			  <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">849</font></a>
  			 in opposition to the fatherly and truly salutary reproofs of their pastors, who, on the other hand, had formerly swallowed down quietly every kind of insult, even the most atrocious, from the monks.  			  <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">850</font></a>
  			 Are not those worthy of Antichrist’s torturing rack, rather than of Christ’s mild sway, who have ears so tender and backward to listen to the truth? But thus it has been from the beginning.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p21"></a><b>22.</b> He now, by enumerating particular instances, lets them see more distinctly, that he would not by any means be found inferior, if matters came to a contest. And in the first place, he makes mention of the glory of his <i>descent, </i>of which his rivals chiefly vaunted. “If,” says he, “they boast of illustrious <i>descent, </i>I shall be on a level with them, for I also am an <i>Israelite, </i>of the <i>seed of Abraham.” </i>This is a silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of <i>three </i>terms to 			 express it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, <i>three </i>different marks of excellence. By this repetition, in my opinion, he indirectly reproves their folly, inasmuch as they placed the sum-total   			  <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">852</font></a>
  			  of their excellence in a thing that was so trivial,   			  <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">853</font></a>
  			  and this boasting was incessantly in their mouth, so as to be absolutely disgusting, as vain men are accustomed to pour forth empty bravadoes as to a mere nothing.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p24"></a>As to the term <i>Hebrews, </i>it appears from <a name="xvii.v-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#015">Ge 11:15</a><a name="xvii.v-p24.2"></a>, that it denotes descent, and is derived from <i>Heber; </i>and farther, it is probable, that Abraham himself is so 			 called in <a name="xvii.v-p24.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013">Ge 14:13</a><a name="xvii.v-p24.3"></a>, in no other sense than this — that he was descended from that ancestor.   			  <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">854</font></a>
  			  Not altogether without some appearance of truth is the conjecture of those, who explain the term to mean <i>those dwelling beyond the river.</i>   			  <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">855</font></a>
  			  We do not read, it is true, that any one was called so before Abraham, who had <i>passed over the river, </i>when he quitted his native country, and afterwards the appellation came to be a customary one among his posterity, as appears from the history of Joseph. The termination, however, shows that it is expressive of descent, and the passage, that I have quoted, abundantly confirms it.   			  <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">856</font></a>

  			  by placing in opposition to them those which he had of a similar kind; but as they had nothing of solid worth, he on good grounds separates himself from their society, when he has occasion to glory in good earnest. For to be a <i>servant of Christ </i>is a thing that is much more honorable and illustrious, than to be the first-born among all the first-born of Abraham’s posterity. Again, however, with the view of providing 			 against calumnies, he premises that he <i>speaks as a fool</i> “Imagine this,” says he, “to be foolish boasting: it is, nevertheless, true.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p31"></a><i>In labors. </i>By these things he proves that he is a more eminent servant of Christ, and <i>then </i>truly we have a proof that may be relied upon, when <i>deeds </i>instead of <i>words </i>are brought forward.

In the same way we may also understand the term <i>deaths</i> to mean any kind of <i>perils </i>that in a manner threatened present death, instances of which he afterwards specifies. “I have given proof of myself in <i>deaths often, </i>in <i>labors</i> oftener still.” He 			 had made use of the term <i>deaths</i> in the same sense in the first chapter.

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p33"></a><b>24.</b> <i>From the Jews.</i> It is certain that the Jews had at that time been deprived of jurisdiction, but as this was a kind of moderate punishment (as they termed it) it is probable that it was allowed them. Now the law of God was to this effect, that those who did not deserve capital 			 punishment should be beaten in the presence of a judge, (<a name="xvii.v-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002">Deut. 25:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003">3</a><a name="xvii.v-p33.1"></a>,) provided not more than <i>forty stripes </i>were inflicted, lest the body should be disfigured or mutilated by cruelty. Now it is probable, that in process of time it became customary to stop at the thirty-ninth lash,   			  <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">858</font></a>
  			  lest perhaps they should on any occasion, from undue warmth, exceed the number prescribed by God. Many such precautions,   			  <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">859</font></a>
  			  prescribed by the Rabbins,   			  <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">860</font></a>
  			  are to be found among the Jews, which make some restriction upon the permission that the Lord had given. Hence, perhaps, in process of time, (as things generally deteriorate,) they came to think, that all criminals should be beaten with stripes to that number, though the Lord did not prescribe, how far severity should go, but where it was to stop; unless perhaps you prefer to receive what is stated by others, that they exercised greater cruelty upon Paul. This is 			 not at all improbable, for if they had been accustomed ordinarily to practice this severity upon all, he might have said that he was beaten according to custom. Hence the statement of the number is expressive of extreme severity.</p>

 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvii.v-p42"></a>for Christ’s name’s sake he was hated by all. <br> 			 (<a name="xvii.v-p42.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022">Mt 10:22</a><a name="xvii.v-p42.2"></a>.)</p>

On the other hand, while those effeminate boasters  			  <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">862</font></a>
  			 had done nothing for Christ, and had suffered nothing for him, they, nevertheless, impudently vaunted.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p46"></a>It is asked, however, whether any one can be a servant of Christ, that has not been tried with so many evils, perils, and vexations?

  			 but where these things are seen, there is, undoubtedly, a greater and more illustrious testimony afforded.

  			 and worthless persons, provided he has an eye to Christ, not to himself — for nothing but pride or ambition could corrupt and tarnish all these praises. For the main thing is — that we serve Christ with a pure <i>conscience. </i>All other things are, as it were, additional.</p>

  			  — when, for the purpose of declaring the truth, we reverently call God as our witness. Now this persecution was, as it were, Paul’s first apprenticeship,   			  <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">872</font></a>

As, however, flight gives no evidence of a valiant spirit, it may be asked, why it is that he makes mention of his flight? I answer, that the gates of the royal city having been closed, clearly 			 showed with what rage the wicked were inflamed against him; and it was on no light grounds that they had been led to entertain such a feeling,   			  <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">873</font></a>
  			  for if Paul had not fought for Christ with a new and unusual activity, the wicked would never have been thrown into such a commotion. His singular perseverance, however, shone forth chiefly in this — that, after escaping from so severe a persecution, he did not cease to stir up the whole world against him, by prosecuting fearlessly the Lord’s work.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.vi-p20"></a>It may be, however, that he proceeds to mock those ambitious men, who, while they had never had experience of any thing but applauses, favors, honorable salutations, and agreeable lodgings, wished to be held in the highest esteem. For, in opposition to this, he relates, that he was shut in, so that he could with difficulty save his life by a miserable and ignominious flight.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.vi-p21"></a>Some, however, ask, whether it was lawful for Paul to leap over the walls, inasmuch as it was a capital crime to do so? I answer, in the first place, that it is not certain, whether that punishment was sanctioned by law in the East; and farther, that even if it was so, Paul, nevertheless, was guilty of no crime, because he did not do this as an enemy, or for sport, but from necessity. For the law would not punish a man, that would throw 			 himself down from the walls to save his life from the flames; and what difference is there between a fire, and a fierce attack from robbers? We must always, in connection with laws, have an eye to reason and equity.  			  <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">874</font></a>
  			 This consideration will exempt Paul entirely from blame.</p>
