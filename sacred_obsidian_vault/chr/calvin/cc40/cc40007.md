 <p><a name="viii.i-p2"></a><b>1</b> <i>But I had determined</i> Whoever it was that divided the chapters, made here a foolish division. For now at length the Apostle explains, in what manner he had <i>spared </i>them. “I had determined,” says he, “not to come to you any more in 			 sorrow,” or in other words, to occasion you sorrow by my coming. For he had come once by an Epistle, by means of which he had severely pained them. Hence, so long as they had not repented, he was unwilling to come to them, lest he should be constrained to grieve them again, when present with them, for he chose rather to give them longer time for repentance.   			  <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">311</font></a>
  			  The word <a name="viii.i-p3.2"></a>ἔκρινα <i>(I determined) </i>must be rendered in the pluperfect tense,   			  <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">312</font></a>
  			  for, when assigning a reason for the delay that had occurred, he explains what had been his intention previously.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.i-p5"></a><a name="viii.i-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.i-p6"></a><b>2.</b> <i>For if I make you sorry</i> Here we have the proof of the foregoing statement. No one willingly occasions sorrow to himself. Now Paul says, that he has such a fellow-feeling with the Corinthians,   			  <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">313</font></a>
  			  that he cannot feel joyful, unless he sees them happy. Nay more, he declares that they were the source and the authors of his joy — which they could not be, if they were themselves sorrowful. If this disposition prevail in pastors, it will be the best restraint, to keep them back from alarming with terrors those minds, which they ought rather to have encouraged by means of a cheerful affability. For from this arises an excessively morose harshness   			  <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">314</font></a>
  			  — so that we do not rejoice in the welfare of the Church, as were becoming.</p>  <a name="viii.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption10"><a name="viii.ii-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003">2 Corinthians 2:3-5</a><a name="viii.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p2"></a><b>3</b>. And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p3"></a><b>3</b>. Et scripseram vobis hoc, ne veniens tristitiam super tristitiam haberem, a quibus oportebat me gaudere: fiduciam habens de vobis omnibus, quod meum gaudium vestrum omnium sit.</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p4"></a><b>4</b>. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p5"></a><b>4</b>. Ex multa enim afflictione et angustia cordis scripsi vobis per multas lacrimas: non ut contristaremini, sed ut caritatem cognosceretis, quam habeo abundantius erga vos.</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p6"></a><b>5</b>. But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p7"></a><b>5</b>. Si quis autem contristavit, non me contristavit, sed ex parte: ut ne vos omnes gravem.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p8"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii-p9"></a><a name="viii.ii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p10"></a><b>3.</b> <i>I had written to you.</i> As he had said a little before, that he delayed coming to them, in order that he <i>might not come a second time in sorrow </i>and with severity, (<a name="viii.ii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001">2Co 2:1</a><a name="viii.ii-p10.1"></a>,) so now also he lets them know, that he came the first time in sadness by an Epistle, that they might not have occasion to feel this severity when he was present with them. Hence they have no ground to complain of that former sadness, in which he was desirous to consult their welfare. He goes even a step farther, by stating that, when writing, he did not wish to occasion them grief, or to give any expression of displeasure, but, on the contrary, to 			 give proof of his attachment and affection towards them. In this way, if there was any degree of keenness in the Epistle, he does not merely soften it, but even shows amiableness and suavity. When, however, he confesses afterwards, what he here denies, he appears to contradict himself. I answer, that there is no inconsistency, for he does not come afterwards to confess, that it was his ultimate object to <i>grieve </i>the Corinthians, but that this was 			 the means, by which he endeavored to conduct them to true joy. Previously, however, to his stating this, he speaks here simply as to his design. He passes over in silence, or delays mentioning for a little the means, which were not so agreeable.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p11"></a><i>Having confidence</i> This confidence he exercises towards the Corinthians, that they may thus in their turn be persuaded of his friendly disposition. For he that hates, is envious; but where joy is felt in common, there must in that case be perfect love.   			  <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">315</font></a>
  			  If, however, the Corinthians are not in accordance with Paul’s opinion and judgment as to them, they shamefully disappoint him.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii-p13"></a><a name="viii.ii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p14"></a><b>4.</b> <i>For out of much affliction</i> Here he brings forward another reason with the view of softening the harshness which he had employed. For those who smilingly take delight in seeing others weep, inasmuch as they discover thereby their cruelty, cannot and ought not to be borne with. 			 Paul, however, declares that his feeling was very different. “Intensity of grief,” says he, “has extorted from me every thing that I have written.” Who would not excuse, and take in good part what springs from such a temper of mind, more especially as it was not on his own account or through his own fault, that he suffered grief, and farther, he does not give vent to his grief, with the view of lightning himself by burdening them, but rather, for the purpose of shewing his affection for them? 			 On these accounts, it did not become the Corinthians to be offended at this somewhat severe reproof.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p15"></a>He adds, <i>tears</i> — which, in a man that is brave and magnanimous are a token of intense grief. Hence we see, from what emotions of mind pious and holy admonitions and reproofs must of necessity proceed. For there are many noisy reprovers, who, by declaiming, or rather, fulminating against vices, display a surprising ardour of zeal, 			 while in the mean time they are at ease in their mind,   			  <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">316</font></a>
  			  so that it might seem as if they exercised their throat and sides   			  <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">317</font></a>
  			  by way of sport. It is, however, the part of a pious pastor, to weep within himself, before he calls upon others to weep:   			  <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">318</font></a>
  			  to feel tortured in silent musings, before he shows any token of displeasure; and to keep within his own breast more grief, than he causes to others. We must, also, take notice of Paul’s tears, which, by their abundance, shew tenderness of heart, but it is of a more heroical character than was the iron-hearted hardness of the Stoics.   			  <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">319</font></a>
  			  For the more tender the affections of love are, they are so much the more praiseworthy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p20"></a>The adverb <i>more abundantly</i> may be explained in a comparative sense; and, in that case, it would be a tacit complaint — that the Corinthians do not make an equal return in respect of affection, inasmuch as they love but coldly one by whom they are ardently loved. I take it, however, in a more simple way, as 			 meaning that Paul commends his affection towards them, in order that this assurance may soften down every thing of harshness that might be in his words.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii-p21"></a><a name="viii.ii-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p22"></a><b>5.</b> <i>But if any one.</i> Here is a <i>third </i>reason with the view of alleviating the offense — that he had grief in common with them, and that the occasion of it came from another quarter. “We have,” says he, “been alike grieved, and another is 			 to blame for it.” At the same time he speaks of that person, too, somewhat mildly, when he says, <i>if any one</i> — not affirming the thing, but rather leaving it in suspense. This passage, however, is understood by some, as if Paul meant to say: “He that has given me occasion of grief, has given offense to you also; for you ought to have felt grieved along with me, and yet I have been left almost to 			 grieve alone. For I do not wish to say so absolutely — <i>that I may not put the blame upon you all.”</i> In this way the second clause would contain a correction of the first. Chrysostom’s exposition, however, is much more suitable; for he reads it as one continued sentence — “<i>He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you. </i>And as 			 to my saying <i>in part, </i>I do so in order that I may not <i>bear too hard upon him.”</i>   			  <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">320</font></a>
  			  I differ from Chrysostom merely in the clause <i>in part, </i>for I understand it as meaning <i>in some measure. </i>I am aware, that Ambrose understands it as meaning — part of the saints, inasmuch as the Church of the Corinthians was divided; but that is more ingenious than solid.</p>  <a name="viii.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption10"><a name="viii.iii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006">2 Corinthians 2:6-11</a><a name="viii.iii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p4"></a><b>7.</b> So that contrariwise ye <i>ought</i> rather to forgive <i>him</i>, and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p5"></a><b>7</b>. Ut potius e diverso debeatis condonare, et consolari: ne forte abundantiori tristitia absorbeatur, qui eiusmodi est.</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p8"></a><b>9</b>. For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p9"></a><b>9</b>. Nam in hoc etiam scripseram vobis, ut probationem vestri cognoscerem: an ad omnia obedientes sitis.</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p10"></a><b>10.</b> To whom ye forgive any thing, I <i>forgive</i> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <i>it</i>, for your sakes <i>forgave I it </i>in the person of Christ;</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p11"></a><b>10.</b> Cui autem condonatis, etiam ego: etenim cui condonavi, si quid condonavi, propter vos condonavi in conspectu Christi.</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p12"></a><b>11.</b> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p16"></a><b>6.</b> <i>Sufficient.</i> He now extends kindness even to the man who had sinned more grievously than the others, and on whose account his anger had been kindled against them all, inasmuch as they had connived at his crime. In his showing indulgence even to one who was deserving of severer 			 punishment, the Corinthians have a striking instance to convince them, how much he disliked excessive harshness. It is true, that he does not act this part merely for the sake of the Corinthians, but because he was naturally of a forgiving temper; but still, in this instance of mildness, the Corinthians could not but perceive his remarkable kindness of disposition. In addition to this, he does not merely show himself to be indulgent, but exhorts others to receive him into favor, in the exercise 			 of the same mildness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p17"></a>Let us, however, consider these things a little more minutely. He refers to the man who had defiled himself by an incestuous marriage with his mother-in-law. As the iniquity was not to be tolerated, Paul had given orders, that the man should be excommunicated. He had, also, severely reproved the Corinthians, because they had so long given encouragement to that enormity  			  <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">321</font></a>
  			 by their dissimulation and patient endurance. It appears from this passage, that he had been brought to repentance, after having been admonished by the Church. Hence Paul gives orders, that he be forgiven, and that he be also supported by consolation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p19"></a>This passage ought to be carefully observed, as it shows us, with what equity and clemency the discipline of the Church ought to be regulated, in order that there may not be undue severity. There is need of strictness, in order that the wicked may not be rendered more daring by impunity, which is justly pronounced an allurement to vice. But on the other hand, as there is a danger of the person, who is chastised, becoming dispirited, 			 moderation must be used as to this — so that the Church shall be prepared to extend forgiveness, so soon as she is fully satisfied as to his penitence. In this department, I find a lack of wisdom on the part of the ancient bishops; and indeed they ought not to be excused, but on the contrary, we ought rather to mark their error, that we may learn to avoid it. Paul is satisfied with the repentance of the offender, that a reconciliation may take place with the Church. They, on the other hand, by 			 making no account of his repentance, have issued out canons as to repentance during three years, during seven years, and in some cases during life. By these they exclude poor unhappy men from the fellowship of the Church. And, in this way, the offender is either alienated the more from the Church, or  			  <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">322</font></a>
  			 is induced to practice hypocrisy. But even if the enactment were more plausible in itself, this consideration would, in my view, be enough to condemn it — that it is at variance with the rule of the Holy Spirit, which the Apostle here prescribes.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p21"></a><a name="viii.iii-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p22"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Lest such an one should be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow</i> The end of excommunication, so far as concerns the power of the offender, is this: that, overpowered with a sense of his sin, he may be humbled in the sight of God and the Church, and may solicit pardon with sincere 			 dislike and confession of guilt. The man who has been brought to this, is now more in need of consolation, than of severe reproof. Hence, if you continue to deal with him harshly, it will be — not discipline, but cruel domineering. Hence we must carefully guard against pressing them beyond this limit.   			  <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">323</font></a>
  			  For nothing is more dangerous, than to give Satan a handle, to tempt an offender to despair. Now we furnish Satan with arms in every instance, in which we leave without consolation those, who are in good earnest affected with a view of their sin.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p24"></a><a name="viii.iii-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p25"></a><b>9.</b> <i>For I had written to you also for this purpose.</i> He anticipates an objection, that they might bring forward. “What then did you mean, when you were so very indignant, because we had not inflicted punishment upon him? From being so stern a judge, to become all at once a defender — 			 is not this indicative of a man, that wavers between conflicting dispositions?”   			  <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">324</font></a>
  			  This idea might detract greatly from Paul’s authority; but he answers, that he has obtained what he asked, and that he was therefore satisfied, so that he must now give way to compassion. For, their carelessness having been corrected, there was nothing to hinder their lifting up the man by their clemency, when now prostrate and downcast.   			  <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">325</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p28"></a><a name="viii.iii-p28.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p29"></a><b>10.</b> <i>To whom ye forgive</i>. That he might the more readily appease them, he added his vote in support of the pardon extended by them.   			  <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">326</font></a>
  			  “Do not hesitate to forgive: I promise that I shall confirm whatever you may have done, and I already subscribe your sentence of forgiveness.” <i>Secondly</i>, he says that he does this <i>for their sake;</i> and that too, sincerely and cordially. He had already shown how desirous he was, that the man’s welfare should be consulted: he now declares, that he grants this willingly to 			 the Corinthians.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p31"></a>Instead of the expression <i>in the sight of Christ</i>, some prefer <i>person</i>,   			  <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">327</font></a>
  			  because Paul in that reconciliation was in the room of Christ,   			  <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">328</font></a>
  			  and did in a manner represent his person.   			  <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">329</font></a>
  			  I am, however, more inclined to understand him as declaring, that he forgives sincerely and without any pretence. For he is accustomed to employ this phrase to express pure and undisguised rectitude. If, however, any one prefers the former interpretation, it is to be observed that the <i>person of Christ</i> is interposed, because there is nothing that ought to incline us more to 			 the exercise of mercy.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p35"></a><a name="viii.iii-p35.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p36"></a><b>11.</b> <i>That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan.</i> This may be viewed as referring to what he had said previously respecting excessive sorrow. For it is a most wicked   			  <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">330</font></a>
  			  fraud of Satan, when depriving us of all consolation, he swallows us up, as it were, in a gulf of despair; and such is the explanation that is given of it by Chrysostom. I prefer, however, to view it as referring to Paul and the Corinthians. For there was a twofold danger, that beset them from the stratagems of Satan — in the event of their being excessively harsh and rigorous, or, on the other hand, in case of dissension arising among them. For it very frequently 			 happens, that, under colour of zeal for discipline, a Pharisaical rigour creeps in, which hurries on the miserable offender to ruin, instead of curing him. It is rather, however, in my opinion, of the <i>second </i>danger that he speaks; for if Paul had not to some extent favored the wishes of the Corinthians, Satan would have prevailed by kindling strife among them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p38"></a><i>For we are not ignorant of his devices</i> That is, “We know, from being warned of it by the Lord, that one stratagem to which he carefully has recourse is, that when he cannot ruin us by open means, he surprises us when off our guard by making a secret attack.   			  <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">331</font></a>
  			  As, then, we are aware that he makes an attack upon us by indirect artifices, and that he assails us by secret machinations, we must look well before us, and carefully take heed that he may not, from some quarter, do us injury. He employs the word <i>devices </i>in the sense in which the Hebrews make use of the term <a name="viii.iii-p39.2"></a>זמה (<i>zimmah</i>,) but in a bad sense,   			  <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">332</font></a>
  			  as meaning artful schemes and machinations, which ought not to be unknown to believers, and will not be so, provided they give themselves up to the guidance of God’s Spirit. In short, as God warns us, that Satan employs every means to impose upon us, and, in addition to this, shows us by what methods he may practice imposture upon us, it is our part to be on the alert, that he may have not a single chink to creep through.</p>  <a name="viii.iv"></a>

As, however, he did not find Titus there, whom he had sent to Corinth, and by whom he ought to have been informed respecting the state of that Church, though he might have done much good there, and though he had an opportunity presented to him, yet, he says, setting everything aside, he came to Macedonia, desirous to see 			 Titus. Here is an evidence of a singular degree of attachment to the Corinthians, that he was so anxious respecting them, that he <i>had no rest</i> anywhere, even when a large prospect of usefulness presented itself, until he had learned the state of their affairs. Hence it appears why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to come to them until he had learned the state of 			 their affairs. Hence it appears, why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to come to them, until he had first had a conversation with Titus. He afterwards learned from the report brought him by Titus, that matters were at that time not yet ripe for his coming to them. Hence it is evident, that Paul loved the Corinthians so much, that he accommodated all his journeyings and long circuits to their welfare, and that he had accordingly come to them later than he had promised — not 			 from having, in forgetfulness of his promise, rashly changed his plan, or from having been carried away by some degree of <i>fickleness, </i>(<a name="viii.iv-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017">2Co 1:17</a><a name="viii.iv-p17.1"></a>,) but because delay was more profitable for them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p18"></a><i>A door also having been opened to me.</i> We have spoken of this metaphor when commenting on the last chapter of the First Epistle. (<a name="viii.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">1Co 16:9</a><a name="viii.iv-p18.1"></a>.) Its meaning is, that an opportunity of promoting the gospel had 			 presented itself.   			  <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">334</font></a>
  			  For as an opportunity of entering is furnished when the <i>door is opened, </i>so the servants of the Lord make advances when an opportunity is presented. The <i>door is shut, </i>when no prospect of usefulness is held out. Now as, on the door being shut, it becomes us to enter upon a new course, rather than by farther efforts to weary ourselves to no purpose by useless labor, so 			 where an opportunity presents itself of edifying, let us consider that by the hand of God a door is opened to us for introducing Christ there, and let us not withhold compliance with so kind an indication from God.   			  <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">335</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p21"></a>It may seem, however, as if Paul had erred in this — that disregarding, or at least leaving unimproved, an opportunity that was placed within his reach, he betook himself to Macedonia. “Ought he not rather to have applied himself to the work that he had in hand, than, after making little more than a commencement, break away all on a sudden in another direction?” We have also observed already, that the <i>opening of a door </i>is an evidence 			 of a divine call, and this is undoubtedly true. I answer, that, as Paul was not by any means restricted to one Church, but was bound to many at the same time, it was not his duty, in consequence of the present aspect of one of them, to leave off concern as to the others. Farther, the more connection he had with the Corinthian Church, it was his duty to be so much the more inclined to aid it; for we must consider it to be reasonable, that a Church, which he had founded by his ministry, should be 			 regarded by him with a singular affection  			  <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">336</font></a>
  			 — just as at this day it is our duty, indeed, to promote the welfare of the whole Church, and to be concerned for the entire body of it; and yet, every one has, nevertheless, a closer and holier connection with his own Church, to whose interests he is more particularly devoted. Matters were in an unhappy state at Corinth, so that Paul was in no ordinary degree anxious as to the issue. It is not, therefore, to be wondered, if, under the influence of this motive, he left unimproved an 			 opportunity that in other circumstances was not to be neglected; as it was not in his power to occupy every post of duty at one and the same time. It is not, however, at all likely that he left Troas, till he had first introduced some one in his place to improve the opening that had occurred.  			  <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">337</font></a>

 <p><a name="viii.iv-p25"></a><b>14.</b> <i>But thanks be to God</i> Here he again glories in the success of his ministry, and shows that he had been far from idle in the various places he had visited; but that he may do this in no invidious way, he sets out with a thanksgiving, which we shall find him afterwards repeating. 			 Now he does not, in a spirit of ambition, extol his own actions, that his name may be held in renown, nor does he, in mere pretense, give thanks to God in the manner of the Pharisee, while lifted up, in the mean time, with pride and arrogance. (<a name="viii.iv-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011">Lu 18:11</a><a name="viii.iv-p25.1"></a>.) Instead of this, he desires from his heart, that whatever is worthy of praise, be recognised as the work of God alone, that his 			 power alone may be extolled. Farther, he recounts his own praises with a view to the advantage of the Corinthians, that, on hearing that he had served the Lord with so much fruit in other places, they may not allow his labor to be unproductive among themselves, and may learn to respect his ministry, which God everywhere rendered so glorious and fruitful. For what God so illustriously honors, it is criminal to despise, or lightly esteem. Nothing was more injurious to the Corinthians, than to 			 have an unfavorable view of Paul’s Apostleship and doctrine: nothing, on the other hand, was more advantageous, than to hold both in esteem. Now he had begun to be held in contempt by many, and hence, it was not his duty to be silent. In addition to this, he sets this holy boasting in opposition to the revilings of the wicked.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p26"></a><i>Who causeth us to triumph</i> If you render the word literally, it will be, <a name="viii.iv-p26.1"></a><i>Qui nos triumphat</i> — <i>Who triumpheth over us.</i>   			  <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">338</font></a>
  			  Paul, however, means something different from what this form of expression denotes among the Latins.   			  <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">339</font></a>
  			  For captives are said to be <i>triumphed over, </i>when, by way of disgrace, they are bound with chains and dragged before the chariot of the conqueror. Paul’s meaning, on the other hand, is, that he was also a sharer in the triumph enjoyed by God, because it had been gained by his instrumentality, just as the lieutenants accompanied on horseback the chariot of the chief general, as sharers in the honor.   			  <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">340</font></a>
  			  As, accordingly, all the ministers of the gospel fight under God’s auspices, so they also procure for him the victory and the honor of the <i>triumph</i>;   			  <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">341</font></a>
  			  but, at the same time, he honors each of them with a share of the <i>triumph, </i>according to the station assigned him in the army, and proportioned to the exertions made by him. Thus they enjoy, as it were, a <i>triumph, </i>but it is God’s rather than theirs.   			  <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">342</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p32"></a>He adds, <i>in Christ, </i>in whose person God himself <i>triumphs, </i>inasmuch as he has conferred upon him all the glory of empire. Should any one prefer to render it thus: “Who triumphs by means of us,” even in that way a sufficiently consistent meaning will be made 			 out.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p33"></a><i>The odor of his knowledge.</i> The <i>triumph </i>consisted in this, that God, through his instrumentality, wrought powerfully and gloriously, perfuming the world with the health-giving <i>odor </i>of his grace, while, by means of his doctrine, he 			 brought some to the knowledge of Christ. He carries out, however, the metaphor of <i>odor, </i>by which he expresses both the delectable sweetness of the gospel, and its power and efficacy for inspiring life. In the mean time, Paul instructs them, that his preaching is so far from being savourless, that it quickens souls by its very <i>odor. </i>Let us, however, learn from this, that those alone make right 			 proficiency in the gospel, who, by the sweet fragrance of Christ, are stirred up to desire him, so as to bid farewell to the allurements of the world.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p34"></a>He says<i> in every place, </i>intimating by these words, that he went to no place in which he did not gain some fruit, and that, wherever he went, there was to be seen some reward of his labor. The Corinthians were aware, in how many places he had previously sowed the seed of Christ’s gospel. He now says, that the 			 last corresponded with the first.   			  <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">343</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iv-p36"></a><a name="viii.iv-p36.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p37"></a><b>15.</b> <i>A sweet odor of Christ</i> The metaphor which he had applied to the knowledge of Christ, he now transfers to the persons of the Apostles, but it is for the same reason. For as they are called the <i>light of the world, </i>(<a name="viii.iv-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mt 5:14</a><a name="viii.iv-p37.1"></a>,) because they enlighten men by holding forth the torch of the gospel, and not as if they shone forth upon them with their own lustre; so they have the name of <i>odor, </i>not as if they emitted any fragrance of themselves, but because the doctrine which they bring is odoriferous, so that it can imbue the whole world with its delectable 			 fragrance.   			  <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">344</font></a>
  			  It is certain, however, that this commendation is applicable to all the ministers of the gospel, because wherever there is a pure and unvarnished proclamation of the gospel, there will be found <i>there </i>the influence of that <i>odor, </i>of which Paul here speaks. At the same time, there is no doubt, that he speaks particularly of himself, and those that were like him, turning 			 to his own commendation what slanderers imputed to him as a fault. For his being opposed by many, and exposed to the hatred of many, was the reason why they despised him. He, accordingly, replies, that faithful and upright ministers of the gospel have a sweet odor before God, not merely when they quicken souls by a wholesome savour, but also, when they bring destruction to unbelievers. Hence the gospel ought not to be less esteemed on that account. “Both odors,” says he, “are grateful to God — 			 that by which the elect are refreshed unto salvation, and that from which the wicked receive a deadly shock.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p39"></a>Here we have a remarkable passage, by which we are taught, that, whatever may be the issue of our preaching, it is, notwithstanding, well-pleasing to God, if the Gospel is preached, and our service will be acceptable to him; and also, that it does not detract in any degree from the dignity of the Gospel, that it does not do good to all; for God is glorified even in this, that the Gospel becomes an occasion of ruin to the wicked, nay, it must 			 turn out so. If, however, this is a <i>sweet odor </i>to God, it ought to be so to us also, or in other words, it does not become us to be offended, if the preaching of the Gospel is not salutary to all; but on the contrary, let us reckon, that it is quite enough, if it advance the glory of God by bringing just condemnation upon the wicked. If, however, the heralds of the Gospel are in bad odor in the world, because their success does not in all respects come up to their desires, they have this 			 choice consolation, that they waft to God the perfume of a sweet fragrance, and what is to the world an offensive smell, is a <i>sweet odor </i>to God and angels.  			  <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">345</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p41"></a>The term <i>odor </i>is very emphatic. “Such is the influence of the Gospel in both respects, that it either quickens or kills, not merely by its taste, but by its very smell. Whatever it may be, it is never preached in vain, but has invariably an effect, either for life, or for death.”  			  <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">346</font></a>
  			 But it is asked, how this accords with the nature of the Gospel, which we shall find him, a little afterwards, calling the <i>ministry </i>of life? (<a name="viii.iv-p42.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">2Co 3:6</a><a name="viii.iv-p42.3"></a>.) The answer is easy: The Gospel is preached for salvation: this is what properly belongs to it; but believers alone are partakers of that salvation. In the mean time, its being an occasion of condemnation to unbelievers — that 			 arises from their own fault. Thus</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="viii.iv-p43"></a>Christ came not into the world to condemn the world,<br> 			 (<a name="viii.iv-p43.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017">Joh 3:17</a><a name="viii.iv-p43.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p44"></a>for what need was there of this, inasmuch as without him we are all condemned? Yet he sends his apostles to <i>bind, </i>as well as to <i>loose, </i>and to <i>retain </i>sins, as well as <i>remit </i>them. (<a name="viii.iv-p44.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018">Mt 18:18</a><a name="viii.iv-p44.1"></a>; <a name="viii.iv-p44.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023">Joh 20:23</a><a name="viii.iv-p44.2"></a>.) He is the <i>light of the world, 			 </i>(<a name="viii.iv-p44.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</a><a name="viii.iv-p44.3"></a>,) but he blinds unbelievers. (<a name="viii.iv-p44.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039">Joh 9:39</a><a name="viii.iv-p44.4"></a>.) He is a Rock, for a foundation, but he is also to many a stone of stumbling.  			  <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">347</font></a>
  			 (<a name="viii.iv-p45.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a><a name="viii.iv-p45.2"></a>.) We must always, therefore, distinguish between the proper office of the Gospel,  			  <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">348</font></a>
  			 and the accidental one (so to speak) which must be imputed to the depravity of mankind, to which it is owing, that life to them is turned into death.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iv-p47"></a><a name="viii.iv-p47.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p48"></a><b>16.</b> <i>And who is sufficient for these things?</i> This exclamation is thought by some   			  <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">349</font></a>
  			  to be introduced by way of guarding against arrogance, for he confesses, that to discharge the office of a good Apostle   			  <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">350</font></a>
  			  to Christ is a thing that exceeds all human power, and thus he ascribes the praise to God. Others think, that he takes notice of the small number of good ministers. I am of opinion, that there is an implied contrast that is shortly afterwards expressed. “Profession, it is true, is common, and many confidently boast; but to have the reality, is indicative of a rare and distinguished excellence.   			  <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">351</font></a>
  			  I claim nothing for myself, but what will be discovered to be in me, if trial is made.” Accordingly, as those, who hold in common the office of instructor, claim to themselves indiscriminately the title, Paul, by claiming to himself a peculiar excellence, separates himself from the herd of those, who had little or no experience of the influence of the Spirit.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iv-p52"></a><a name="viii.iv-p52.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p53"></a><b>17.</b> <i>For we are not.</i> He now contrasts himself more openly with the false apostles, and that by way of amplifying, and at the same time, with the view of excluding them from the praise that he had claimed to himself. “It is on good grounds,” says he, “that I speak in honorable terms of 			 my apostleship, for I am not afraid of being convicted of vanity, if proof is demanded. But many on false grounds arrogate the same thing to themselves, who will be found to have nothing in common with me. For they <i>adulterate the word of the Lord, </i>which I dispense with the greatest faithfulness and sincerity for the edification of the Church.” I do not think it likely, however, 			 that those, who are here reproved, preached openly wicked or false doctrines; but am rather of opinion, that they corrupted the right use of doctrine, for the sake either of gain or of ambition, so as utterly to deprive it of energy. This he terms <i>adulterating. </i>Erasmus prefers to render <i>it</i> — <a name="viii.iv-p53.1"></a><i>cauponari</i> — <i>huckstering</i>    			  <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">352</font></a>
  			  The Greek word <a name="viii.iv-p54.2"></a>καπηλεύειν<i>, </i>is taken from retailers, or tavern-keepers, who are accustomed to adulterate their commodities, that they may fetch a higher price. I do not know whether the word <a name="viii.iv-p54.3"></a><i>cauponari</i> is used in 			 that sense among the Latins.   			  <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">353</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p56"></a>It is, indeed, certain from the corresponding clause, that Paul intended to express here — corruption of doctrine — not as though they had revolted from the truth, but because they presented it under disguise, and not in its genuine purity. For the doctrine of God is corrupted in two ways. It is corrupted in a <i>direct</i> way, when it is mixed up with falsehood and lies, so as to be no longer the pure and genuine doctrine of God, but is 			 falsely commended under that title. It is corrupted <i>indirectly, </i>when, although retaining its purity, it is turned hither and thither to please men, and is disfigured by unseemly disguises, by way of hunting after favor. Thus there will be found some, in whose doctrine there will be no impiety detected, but as they hunt after the applauses of the world by making a display of their acuteness and eloquence, or are ambitious of some place, or gape for <i>filthy lucre, </i>(<a name="viii.iv-p56.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008">1Ti 3:8</a><a name="viii.iv-p56.1"></a>,) or are desirous by some means or other to rise, they, nevertheless, corrupt the doctrine itself by wrongfully abusing it, or making it subservient to their depraved inclinations. I am, therefore, inclined to retain the word <i>adulterate, </i>as it expresses better what ordinarily happens in the case of all that play with the sacred word of God, as with a ball, and transform it according to their own 			 convenience.  			  <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">354</font></a>
  			 For it must necessarily be, that they degenerate from the truth, and preach a sort of artificial and spurious Gospel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p58"></a><i>But as of sincerity.</i> The word <i>as </i>here is superfluous, as in many other places.   			  <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">355</font></a>
  			  In contrast with the corruption that he had made mention of, he makes use, <i>first of all</i>, of the term <i>sincerity, </i>which may be taken as referring to the manner of preaching, as well as to the disposition of the mind. I approve rather of the latter. <i>Secondly, </i>he places in contrast with it a faithful and conscientious 			 dispensation of it, inasmuch as he faithfully delivers to the Church from hand to hand,   			  <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">356</font></a>
  			  as they say, the Gospel which God had committed to him, and had given him in charge. <i>Thirdly, </i>he subjoins to this a regard to the Divine presence. For whoever has the three following things, is in no danger of forming the purpose of corrupting the word of God. The <i>first</i> is — that we be actuated by a true zeal for God. The <i>second </i>is — that we bear in mind that it is his business that we are transacting, and bring forward nothing but what has come from him. The <i>third </i>is — that we consider, that we do nothing of which he is not the witness and spectator, and thus learn to refer every thing to his judgment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iv-p61"></a><i>In Christ</i> means <i>according to Christ. </i>For the rendering of Erasmus, <i>By Christ, </i>is foreign to Paul’s intention.   			  <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">357</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="viii.iv-p42"></a>  “<i>We are the savor of death unto death</i>. It is probable that the language here used is borrowed from similar expressions which were common among the Jews.

Again, ‘The word of the law which proceeds out of the mouth of God is an <i>odour</i> <i>of life</i> to the Israelites, but an odour of death to the Gentiles.’” — <i>Barnes</i>. — <i>Ed.</i></p>
