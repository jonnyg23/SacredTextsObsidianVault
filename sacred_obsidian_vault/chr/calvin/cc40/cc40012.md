 <p><a name="xiii.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p3"></a><b>1.</b> Has igitur promissiones quum habeamus, dilecti, mundemus nos ab omni inquinamento carnis et spiritus, sanctificationem perficientes in timore Dei.</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p5"></a><a name="xiii.i-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p6"></a><b>1. </b><i>These promises, therefore.</i> God, it is true, anticipates us in his promises by his pure favor; but when he has, of his own accord, conferred upon us his favor, he immediately afterwards requires from us gratitude in return. Thus what he said to Abraham, <i>I</i> <i>am thy God, 			 </i>(<a name="xiii.i-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Ge 17:7</a><a name="xiii.i-p6.1"></a>,) was an offer of his undeserved goodness, yet he at the same time added what he required from him — <i>Walk before me, and be thou perfect</i> As, however, this second clause is not always expressed, Paul instructs us that in all the promises 			 this condition is implied,   			  <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">624</font></a>
  			  that they must be incitements to us to promote the glory of God. For from what does he deduce an argument to stimulate us? It is from this, that God confers upon us such a distinguished honor. Such, then, is the nature of the promises, that they call us to sanctification, as if God had interposed by an implied agreement. We know, too, what the Scripture teaches in various passages in reference to the design of 			 redemption, and the same thing must be viewed as applying to every token of his favor.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p8"></a><i>From all filthiness of flesh and spirit.</i> Having already shown, that we are called to purity,   			  <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">625</font></a>
  			  he now adds, that it ought to be seen in the body, as well as in the soul; for that the term <i>flesh </i>is taken here to mean the <i>body, </i>and the term <i>spirit</i> to mean the <i>soul, </i>is manifest from this, that if the term <i>spirit </i>meant the grace of regeneration, Paul’s statement in reference to the pollution of the spirit would be absurd. He would have us, therefore, pure from defilements, not merely <i>inward, </i>such as have God alone as their witness; but also <i>outward, </i>such as fall under the observation of men. “Let us not merely have chaste consciences in the sight of God. We must also consecrate to him our whole body and all its members, that no impurity may be seen in any part of us.”   			  <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">626</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p11"></a>Now if we consider what is the point that he handles, we shall readily perceive, that those act with excessive impudence,  			  <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">627</font></a>
  			 who excuse outward idolatry on I know not what pretexts.  			  <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">628</font></a>
  			 For as inward impiety, and superstition, of whatever kind, is a defilement of the spirit, what will they understand by defilement of the flesh, but an outward profession of impiety, whether it be pretended, or uttered from the heart? They boast of a pure conscience; that, indeed, is on false grounds, but granting them what they falsely boast of, they have only the half of what Paul requires from believers. Hence they have no ground to think, that they have given satisfaction to God by 			 that half; for let a person show any appearance of idolatry at all, or any indication of it, or take part in wicked or superstitious rites, even though he were — what he cannot be — perfectly upright in his own mind, he would, nevertheless, not be exempt from the guilt of polluting his body.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p14"></a><i>Perfecting holiness.</i> As the verb <a name="xiii.i-p14.1"></a>ἐπιτελεῖν in Greek sometimes means, <i>to perfect</i>, and sometimes <i>to perform sacred rites</i>,   			  <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">629</font></a>
  			  it is elegantly made use of here by Paul in the former signification, which is the more frequent one — in such a way, however, as to allude to sanctification, of which he is now treating. For while it denotes perfection, it seems to have been intentionally transferred to sacred offices, because there ought to be nothing defective in the service of God, but everything complete. Hence, in order that you may sanctify yourself to God aright, you must dedicate both body 			 and soul entirely to him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p16"></a><i>In the fear of God.</i> For if the<i> fear of God</i> influences us, we will not be so much disposed to indulge ourselves, nor will there be a bursting forth of that audacity of wantonness, which showed itself among the Corinthians. For how does it happen, that many delight themselves so much in outward idolatry, and haughtily defend so gross a vice, unless it be, that they think that 			 they mock God with impunity? If the fear of God had dominion over them, they would immediately, on the first moment, leave off all cavils, without requiring to be constrained to it by any disputations.</p>  <a name="xiii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p16"></a><b>2.</b> <i>Make room for us.</i> Again he returns from a statement of doctrine to treat of what more especially concerns himself, but simply with this intention — that he may not lose his pains in admonishing the Corinthians. Nay more, he closes the preceding admonition with the same statement, 			 which he had made use of by way of preface. For what is meant by the expressions<i> Receive us, </i>or <i>Make room for us? </i>It is equivalent to, <i>Be ye enlarged, </i>(<a name="xiii.ii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013">2Co 6:13</a><a name="xiii.ii-p16.1"></a>;) that is, “Do not allow corrupt affections, or unfavorable apprehensions, to prevent this doctrine from making its way into your minds, and obtaining a place within you. For as I lay myself out for your salvation with a fatherly zeal, it were unseemly that you should turn a deaf ear   			  <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">630</font></a>
  			  upon me.”   			  <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">631</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p19"></a><i>We have done injury to no man.</i> He <i>declares </i>that there is no reason why they should have their minds alienated,   			  <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">632</font></a>
  			  inasmuch as he had not given them occasion of offense in any thing. Now he mentions <i>three </i>kinds of offenses, as to which he declares himself to be guiltless. The <i>first </i>is, manifest hurt or injury. The <i>second </i>is, the corruption that springs from false doctrine. The <i>third </i>is, defrauding or cheating in worldly goods. These are <i>three </i>things by which, for the most part, pastors   			  <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">633</font></a>
  			  are wont to alienate the minds of the people from them — when they conduct themselves in an overbearing manner, and, making their authority their pretext, break forth into tyrannical cruelty or <i>unreasonableness,</i> — <i>or </i>when they draw aside from the right path those to whom they ought to have been guides, and infect them with the corruption of false doctrine, — or when 			 they manifest an insatiable covetousness, by eagerly desiring what belongs to another. Should any one wish to have it in shorter compass-the <i>first </i>is, fierceness and an abuse of power by excessive <i>insolence</i>   			  <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">634</font></a>
  			  the <i>second, </i>unfaithfulness in teaching. the <i>third, </i>avarice.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p23"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p24"></a><b>3.</b> <i>I say not this to condemn you.</i> As the foregoing apology was a sort of expostulation, and we can scarcely avoid reproaching when we expostulate, he softens on this account what he had said. “I clear myself,” says he, <i>“</i>in such a way as to be desirous to avoid, what would tend to your dishonor.” The Corinthians, it is true, were unkind, and they deserved that, on Paul’s being acquitted from blame, <i>they </i>should be substituted in his place as the guilty party; nay more, that they should be held guilty in two respects — in respect of ingratitude, and on the ground of their having calumniated the innocent. Such, however, is the Apostle’s moderation, that he 			 refrains from recrimination, contenting himself with standing simply on the defensive.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p25"></a><i>For I have before said.</i> Those that love do not assail;   			  <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">635</font></a>
  			  nay more, if any fault has been committed, they either cover it over by taking no notice of it, or soften it by kindness. For a disposition to reproach is a sign of hatred. Hence Paul, with the view of showing that he has no inclination to distress the Corinthians, declares his affection towards them. At the same time, he undoubtedly in a manner <i>condemns</i> them, while he says that he does 			 not do so. As, however, there is a great difference between gall and vinegar, so there is also between that condemnation, by which we harass a man in a spirit of hatred, with the view of blasting him with infamy, and, on the other hand, that, by which we endeavor to bring back an offender into the right way, that, along with safety, he may in addition to this regain his honors unimpaired.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p27"></a><i>Ye are in our hearts</i> — that is, “I carry you about with me inclosed in my heart.” <i>To die and live with you </i>— that is, “So that no change can 			 loosen our attachment, for I am prepared not merely to <i>live with you, </i>but also to be associated with you in death, if necessary, and to endure anything rather than renounce your friendship.” Mark well, in what manner all pastors.   			  <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">636</font></a>
  			  ought to be affected.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p29"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p30"></a><b>4.</b> <i>Great is my boldness.</i> Now, as if he had obtained the enlargement of heart that he had desired on the part of the Corinthians, he leaves off complaining, and pours out his heart with cheerfulness. “What need is there that I should expend so much labor upon a matter 			 already accomplished? For I think I have already what I asked. For the things that Titus has reported to me respecting you are not merely sufficient for quieting my mind, but afford me also ground of glorying confidently on your account   			  <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">637</font></a>
  			  Nay more, they have effectually dispelled the grief, which many great and heavy afflictions had occasioned me.” He goes on step by step, by way of climax; for <i>glorying</i> is more than being of an easy and quiet mind; and <i>being freed from grief occasioned by many afflictions, </i>is 			 greater than either of those. Chrysostom explains this <i>boldness</i> somewhat differently, in this manner — “If I deal with you the more freely, it is on this account, that, relying on the assurance of your good will towards me, I think I may take so much liberty with you.” I have stated, however, what appeared to me to be the more probable meaning — that the report given by Titus had removed the unfavorable impression, 			 which had previously racked his mind.   			  <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">638</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p33"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p33.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p34"></a><b>5.</b> <i>For when we had come into Macedonia</i> The heaviness of his grief tends to show, how efficacious the consolation was. “I was pressed on every side,” says he, “by afflictions both internal and external. All this, however, 			 has not prevented the joy that you have afforded me from prevailing over it, and even overflowing.”   			  <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">639</font></a>
  			  When he says that he <i>had no rest in his flesh, </i>it is as if he had said — “As a man, I had no relief.”   			  <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">640</font></a>
  			  For he excepts spiritual consolations, by which he was in the mean time sustained. He was afflicted, therefore, not merely in body, but also in mind, so that, as a man, he experienced nothing but great bitterness of afflictions.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p37"></a><i>Without were fightings</i> By <i>fightings</i> he means outward assaults, with which his enemies molested him: <i>fears</i> he means the anxieties, that he endured on account of the internal maladies of the Church, for it was not so 			 much by personal as by public evils, that he was disquieted. What he means, then, to say is this — that there were not merely avowed enemies that were hostile to him, but that he endured, nevertheless, much distress in consequence of domestic evils. For he saw how great was the infirmity of many, nay of almost all, and in the mean time what, and how diversified, were the machinations, by which Satan attempted to throw every thing into confusion — how few were wise, how few were sincere, how few 			 were steadfast, and how many, on the other hand, were either mere pretenders, and worthless, or ambitious, or turbulent. Amidst these difficulties, the servants of God must of necessity feel alarmed, and be racked with anxieties; and so much the more on this account — that they are constrained to bear many things silently, that they may consult the peace of the Churches. Hence he expressed himself with propriety when he said — <i>Without were fightings; within were 			 fears.</i> For faithful pastors openly set themselves in opposition to those enemies that avowedly attack Christ’s kingdom, but they are inwardly tormented, and endure secret tortures, when they see the Church afflicted with internal evils, for the exterminating of which they dare not openly sound the trumpet.   			  <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">641</font></a>
  			  But although he had almost incessant conflicts, it is probable that he was at that time more severely pressed than usual. The servants of Christ, undoubtedly, have scarcely at any time exemption from <i>fears, </i>and Paul was seldom free from outward <i>fightings;</i> but as he was at that time more violently oppressed, he 			 makes use of the plural number — <i>fightings and fears</i>, meaning that he required to fight in many ways, and against various enemies, and that he had at the same time many kinds of fear.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p39"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p39.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p40"></a><b>6.</b> <i>Who comforteth the lowly.</i> This is mentioned as a reason; for he means that consolation had been offered to him, because he was borne down with evils, and almost overwhelmed, inasmuch as God is wont to <i>comfort the lowly, </i>that is, 			 those that are cast down. Hence a most profitable doctrine may be inferred — that the more we have been afflicted, so much the greater consolation has been prepared for us by God. Hence, in the epithet here applied to God, there is a choice promise contained, as though he had said, that it is peculiarly the part of God to comfort those that are miserable and are abased to the dust.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p41"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p41.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p42"></a><b>7.</b> <i>And not by his coming only.</i> Lest the Corinthians should object in these terms — “What is it to us if Titus has cheered you by his coming? No doubt, as you loved him, you would feel delighted to see him;” he declares, that the occasion of his joy was, that Titus had, on returning from them, communicated the most joyful 			 intelligence. Accordingly he declares, that it was not so much the presence of one individual, as the prosperous condition of the Corinthians, that had cheered him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p43"></a><i>Your desire</i> Mark, what joyful tidings were communicated to Paul respecting the Corinthians. Their <i>desire</i> originated in the circumstance, that they held Paul’s doctrine in high estimation. Their <i>tears </i>were a token of respect; because, being affected with his reproof, they mourned over their sins. Their <i>zeal </i>was an evidence of good will. From these <i>three 			 </i>things he inferred that they were penitent. This afforded him full satisfaction, because he had no other intention or anxiety, than the consulting of their welfare.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p44"></a><i>So that I rejoiced the more</i> — that is, “So that all my griefs and distresses gave way to joy.” Hence we see, not merely with what fervor of mind he desired the public good of the Church, but also how mild and gentle a disposition he possessed, as being one that could suddenly bury in oblivion offenses of so serious a nature. At the same time, this may rather be taken in another way, so as to be viewed in 			 connection with what follows, and I am not sure but that this meaning would correspond better with Paul’s intention. As, however, it is a matter of no great moment, I pass over it slightly.</p>  <a name="xiii.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption10"><a name="xiii.iii-p1"></a><a name="xiii.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008">2 Corinthians 7:8-11</a><a name="xiii.iii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p12"></a><b>8.</b> <i>For though I grieved you. </i>He now begins to apologize to the Corinthians for having handle them somewhat roughly in the former Epistle. Now we must observe, in what a variety of ways he deals with them, so that it might appear as though he sustained different characters. The reason is that his discourse 			 was directed to the whole of the Church. There were some there, that entertained an unfavorable view of him — there were others that held him, as he deserved, in the highest esteem — some were doubtful: others were confident — some were docile: others were obstinate.   			  <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">642</font></a>
  			  In consequence of this diversity, he required to direct his discourse now in one way, then in another, in order to suit himself to all. Now he lessens, or rather he takes away altogether any occasion of offense, on account of the severity that he had employed, on the ground of its having turned out to the promotion of their welfare. “Your welfare,” says he, “is so much an object of desire to me, that I am delighted to see that I have done you good.” This 			 softening-down is admissible only when the teacher   			  <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">643</font></a>
  			  has done good so far as was needed, by means of his reproofs; for if he had found, that the minds of the Corinthians still remained obstinate, and had he perceived an advantage arising from the discipline that he had attempted, he would, undoubtedly, have abated nothing from his former severity. It is to be observed, however, that he rejoices to have been an occasion of grief to those whom he loved; for he was more desirous to profit, than to please them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p15"></a>But what does he mean when he adds — <i>though I did repent?</i> For if we admit, that Paul had felt dissatisfied with what he had written, there would follow an inconsistency of no slight character — that the former Epistle had been written under a rash impulse, rather than under the guidance of the Spirit. I answer, that the word <i>repent</i> is 			 used here in a loose sense for being <i>grieved. </i>For while he made the Corinthians sad, he himself also participated in the grief, and in a manner inflicted grief at the same time upon himself. “Though I gave you pain against my inclination, and it grieved me to be under the necessity of being harsh to you, I am grieved no longer on that account, when I see that it has been of advantage to you.” Let us take an instance from the case of a father; for a father feels grief in connection with 			 his severity, when at any time he chastises his son, but approves of it, notwithstanding, because he sees that it is conducive to his son’s advantage. In like manner Paul could feel no pleasure in irritating the minds of the Corinthians; but, being conscious of the motive that influenced his conduct, he preferred duty to inclination.</p>

He means, that he feels no pleasure whatever in their sorrow — nay more, had he his choice, he would endeavor to promote equally their welfare and their joy, by the same means; but that as he could not do otherwise, their welfare was of so much importance in his view, that he rejoiced that they had been made sorry unto repentance. For there are instances of 			 physicians, who are, indeed, in other respects good and faithful, but are at the same time harsh, and do not spare their patients. Paul declares, that he is not of such a disposition as to employ harsh cures, when not constrained by necessity. As, however, it had turned out well, that he had made trial of that kind of cure, he congratulates himself on his success.

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p21"></a><b>10. </b><i>Sorrow according to God</i>    			  <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">644</font></a>
  			  In the <i>first </i>place, in order to understand what is meant by this <i>clause according to God, </i>we must observe the contrast, for the <i>sorrow that is according to God </i>he contrasts with the <i>sorrow of the world</i> Let us now 			 take, also, the contrast between two kinds of joy. The <i>joy of the world </i>is, when men foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity, that is, in the world, and, intoxicated with a transient felicity, look no higher than the earth. The <i>joy that is according to God </i>is, when men place all their happiness in God, and take satisfaction in His grace, and show this by contempt of the 			 world, using earthly prosperity as if they used it not, and joyful in the midst of adversity. Accordingly, the <i>sorrow of the world</i> is, when men despond in <i>consequence </i>of earthly afflictions, and are overwhelmed with grief; while <i>sorrow according to God </i>is that which has an eye to God, while they reckon it the one misery 			 — to have lost the favor of God; when, impressed with fear of His judgment, they mourn over their sins. This sorrow Paul makes the cause and origin of repentance. This is carefully to be observed, for unless the sinner be dissatisfied with himself, detest his manner of life, and be thoroughly grieved from an apprehension of sin, he will never betake himself to the Lord.   			  <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">645</font></a>
  			  On the other hand, it is impossible for a man to experience a sorrow of this kind, without its giving birth to a new heart. Hence repentance takes its rise in grief, for the reason that I have mentioned — because no one can return to the right way, but the man who hates sin; but where hatred of sin is, <i>there </i>is self-dissatisfaction and grief.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p24"></a>There is, however, a beautiful allusion here to the term <i>repentance, </i>when he says —<i> not to be repented of; </i>for however unpleasant the thing is at first taste, it renders itself desirable by its usefulness. The epithet, it is true, might apply to the term <i>salvation, </i>equally as to that of <i>repentance; </i>but 			 it appears to me to suit better with the term <i>repentance</i> “We are taught by the result itself, that grief ought not to be painful to us, or distressing. In like manner, although repentance contains in it some degree of bitterness, if, is spoken of as<i> not to be repented of</i> on account of the precious and pleasant fruit which it produces.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p25"></a><i>To salvation</i> Paul seems to make repentance the ground of salvation. Were it so, it would follow, that we are justified by works. I answer, that we must observe what Paul here treats of, for he is not inquiring as to the ground of salvation, but simply commending repentance from the fruit which it produces, he says that it is like a way by which we arrive at salvation. Nor is it without good reason; for 			 Christ <i>calls us </i>by way of free favor, but it is <i>to repentance. </i>(<a name="xiii.iii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013">Mt 9:13</a><a name="xiii.iii-p25.1"></a>.) God by way of free favor pardons our sins, but only when we renounce them. Nay more, God accomplishes in us at one and the same time two things: being renewed by repentance, we are delivered from the <i>bondage </i>of our sins; and, being justified by faith, we are delivered also from the <i>curse </i>of our sins. They 			 are, therefore, inseparable fruits of grace, and, in consequence of their invariable connection, repentance may with fitness and propriety be represented as an introduction to salvation, but in this way of speaking of it, it is represented as an <i>effect </i>rather than as a <i>cause. </i>These are not refinements for the purpose of evasion, but a true and simple solution, for, while Scripture teaches us that we never obtain forgiveness of sins without repentance, it represents at the same 			 time, in a variety of passages, the mercy of God alone as the ground of our obtaining it.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iii-p26"></a><a name="xiii.iii-p26.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p27"></a><b>11. </b><i>What earnest desire it produced in you</i> I shall not enter into any dispute as to whether the things that Paul enumerates are effects of repentance, or belong to it, or are preparatory to it, as all this is unnecessary for understanding Paul’s design, for he simply proves the repentance of the 			 Corinthians from its signs, or accompaniments. At the same time he makes <i>sorrow according to God</i> to be the source of all these things, inasmuch as they spring from it — which is assuredly the case; for when we have begun to feel self-dissatisfaction, we are afterwards stirred up to seek after the other things.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p28"></a>What is meant by <i>earnest desire, </i>we may understand from what is opposed to it; for so long as there is no apprehension of sin, we lie drowsy and inactive. Hence drowsiness or carelessness, or unconcern,  			  <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">646</font></a>
  			 stands opposed to that <i>earnest desire, </i>that he makes mention of. Accordingly, <i>earnest desire </i>means simply an eager and active assiduity in the correcting of what is amiss, and in the amendment of life.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p30"></a><i>Yea, what clearing of yourselves</i> Erasmus having rendered it <i>satisfaction, </i>ignorant persons, misled by the ambiguity of the term, have applied it to popish <i>satisfactions, </i>whereas Paul employs the term <a name="xiii.iii-p30.1"></a>ἀπολογίαν<i>, </i>(<i>defense.</i>) It is on this account that I have preferred to retain the word <a name="xiii.iii-p30.2"></a><i>defensionem</i><i>, </i>which the Old Interpreter had made use of. 			   			  <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">647</font></a>
  			  It is, however, to be observed, that it is a kind of <i>defense </i>that consists rather in supplication for pardon, than in extenuation of sin. As a son, who is desirous to clear himself to his father, does not enter upon a regular pleading of his cause, but by acknowledging his fault excuses himself, rather in the spirit of a suppliant, than in a tone of confidence, hypocrites, also, excuse themselves — nay more, they 			 haughtily defend themselves, but it is rather in the way of disputing with God, than of returning to favor with him; and should any one prefer the word <a name="xiii.iii-p31.1"></a><i>excusationem</i><i>, </i>(<i>excuse,</i>) I do not object to it; because the meaning will amount to the same thing, that the 			 Corinthians were prompted to clear themselves, whereas previously they cared not what Paul thought of them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p32"></a><i>Yea, what indignation</i>    			  <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">648</font></a>
  			  This disposition, also, is attendant on sacred sorrow — that the sinner is indignant against his vices, and even against himself, as also all that are actuated by a right zeal   			  <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">649</font></a>
  			  are indignant, as often as they see that God is offended. This disposition, however, is more intense than sorrow. For the <i>first </i>step is, that evil be displeasing to us. The <i>second </i>is, that, being inflamed with anger, we press hard upon ourselves, so that our consciences may be touched to the quick. It may, however, be taken here to mean the<i> 			 indignation, </i>with which the Corinthians had been inflamed against the sins of one or a few, whom they had previously spared. Thus they repented of their concurrence or connivance.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p35"></a><i>Fear</i> is what arises from an apprehension of divine judgment, while the offender thinks — “Mark it well, an account must be rendered by thee, and what wilt thou advance in the presence of so great a judge?” For, alarmed by such a consideration, he begins to tremble.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p36"></a>As, however, the wicked themselves are sometimes touched with an alarm of this nature, he adds <i>desire</i> This disposition we know to be more of a voluntary nature than <i>fear, </i>for we are often afraid against our will, but we never desire but from inclination. 			 Hence, as they had dreaded punishment on receiving Paul’s admonition, so they eagerly aimed at amendment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p37"></a>But what are we to understand by <i>zeal?</i> There can be no doubt that he intended a climax. Hence it means more than <i>desire</i> Now we may understand by it, that they stirred up each other in a spirit of mutual rivalry. It is simpler, however, to understand it as meaning, that every one, with great fervor of zeal, aimed to 			 give evidence of his repentance. Thus zeal is intensity of desire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p38"></a><i>Yea, what revenge</i> What we have said as to <i>indignation, </i>must be applied also to <i>revenge; </i>for the wickedness which they had countenanced by their connivance and indulgence, they had afterwards shown themselves rigorous 			 in avenging. They had for some time tolerated incest; but, on being admonished by Paul, they had not merely ceased to countenance him, but had been strict reprovers in chastening him, — this was the<i> revenge</i> that was meant. As, however, we ought to punish sins wherever they are,   			  <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">650</font></a>
  			  and not only so, but should begin more especially with ourselves, there is something farther meant in what the Apostle says here, for he speaks of the signs of repentance. There is, among others, this more particularly — that, by punishing sins, we anticipate, in a manner, the judgment of God, as he teaches elsewhere, If we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged by the Lord. (<a name="xiii.iii-p39.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031">1Co 11:31</a><a name="xiii.iii-p39.2"></a>.) We are not, however, to infer from this, that mankind, by taking vengeance upon themselves, compensate to God for the punishment due to him,   			  <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">651</font></a>
  			  so that they redeem themselves from his hand. The case stands thus — that, as it is the design of God by chastising us, to arouse us from our carelessness, that, being reminded of his displeasure, we may be on our guard for the future, when the sinner himself is beforehand in inflicting punishment of his own accord, the effect is, that he no longer stands in need of such an admonition from God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p41"></a>But it is asked, whether the Corinthians had an eye to Paul, or to God, in this <i>revenge, </i>as well as in the <i>zeal,</i> and <i>desire,</i> and the 			 rest.   			  <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">652</font></a>
  			  I answer, that all these things are, under all <i>circumstances, </i>attendant upon repentance, but there is a difference in the case of an individual sinning <i>secretly </i>before God, or openly before the world. If a person’s sin is secret, it is enough if he has this disposition in the sight of God; on the other hand, where the sin is open, there is required besides an open 			 manifestation of repentance. Thus the Corinthians, who had sinned openly and to the great offense of the good, required to give evidence of their repentance by these tokens.</p>  <a name="xiii.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p16"></a>  			 <b>11. </b>  			 <i>Ye have approved yourselves to be clear</i>. The Old Interpreter reads, “Ye have shown yourselves.” Erasmus renders it, “Ye have commended yourselves.” I have preferred a third rendering, which appeared to me to suit better — that the Corinthians showed by clear evidences, that they were in no degree participants in the crime, with which they had appeared, from their connivance, to have had some connection. What those evidences were, 			 we have already seen. At the same time, Paul does not altogether clear them, but palliates their offense. For the undue forbearance, which they had exercised, was not altogether free from blame. He acquits them, however, from the charge of concurrence.   			  <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">653</font></a>
  			  We must farther observe, that he does not acquit all of them without exception, but merely the body of the Church. For it may readily be believed, that some were concerned in it, and countenanced it; but, while all of them together were involved in disgrace, it afterwards appeared that only a few were in fault.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p18"></a><b>12. </b><i>Wherefore if I wrote</i>. He acts as persons are wont to do, that are desirous of a reconciliation. He wishes all past things to be buried, he does not any more reproach them, he does not reprove them for any thing, he does not expostulate as to any thing; in fine, he forgets every thing, inasmuch as he was satisfied with their 			 simply repenting. And, certainly, this is the right way — not to press offenders farther, when they have been brought to repentance. For if we still</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.iv-p19"></a>call their sins to remembrance, (<a name="xiii.iv-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018">1Ki 17:18</a><a name="xiii.iv-p19.1"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p20"></a>it is certain that we are actuated by malevolence, rather than by pious affection, or a desire for their welfare. These things, however, are said by Paul by way of concession, for, unquestionably, he had followed up the offense that he had taken, and had felt desirous that the author of this offense should be chastised, but now he puts his foot upon what had been in some degree offensive. “I am now desirous, that whatever I have written may 			 be looked upon as having been written with no other view, than that you might perceive your affection towards me. As to all other things, let us now leave them as they are.” Others explain it in this way, — that he had not regard to one individual in particular, but consulted the common advantage of all. The former interpretation, however, is the more natural one.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p21"></a><i>Your concern for us.</i> As this reading occurs very generally in the Greek versions, I have not ventured to go so far as to erase it, though at the same time in one ancient manuscript the reading is <a name="xiii.iv-p21.1"></a>ἡμων,<i> 			 </i>(<i>of us,</i>)   			  <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">654</font></a>
  			  and it appears from Chrysostom s Commentaries, that the Latin rendering   			  <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">655</font></a>
  			  was more commonly received in his times even among the Greeks — <i>that our concern for you might become manifest to you, </i>that is, that it might be manifest to the Corinthians, how much concerned Paul was in regard to them. The other rendering, however, in which the greater part of the Greek manuscripts concur, is, notwithstanding, a probable one. For Paul congratulates the Corinthians on their having learned at length, 			 through means of this test, how they stood affected towards him. “You were not yourselves aware of the attachment that you felt towards me, until you had trial of it in this matter.” Others explain it as referring to the particular disposition of an individual, in this way: “That it might be manifest among you, how much respect each of you entertained for me, and that, through the occurrence of 			 this opportunity, each of you might discover what had previously been concealed in his heart.” As this is not of great moment, my readers are at liberty, so far as I am concerned, to make choice of either; but, as he adds at the same time, <i>in the sight of God, </i>I rather think that he meant this — that each of them, having made a thorough search, as if he had come into the presence of God, 			   			  <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">656</font></a>
  			  had come to know himself better than before.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p26"></a><b>13. </b><i>We received consolation.</i> Paul was wholly intent upon persuading the Corinthians, that nothing was more eagerly desired by him than their advantage. Hence he says, that he had shared with them in their consolation. Now their consolation had been this — that, acknowledging their fault, they did not merely 			 take the reproof in good part, but had received it joyfully. For the bitterness of a reproof is easily sweetened, so soon as we begin to taste the profitableness of it to us.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p27"></a>What he adds — that he <i>rejoiced more abundantly on account of the consolation of Titus, </i>is by way of congratulation. Titus had been overjoyed in finding them more obedient and compliant than could have been expected — nay more, in his finding a sudden change for the better. Hence we may infer, that Paul’s 			 gentleness was anything but flattery, inasmuch as he rejoiced in their joy, so as to be, at the same time, chiefly taken up with their repentance.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p29"></a><b>14. </b><i>But if I have boasted any thing to him.</i> He shows indirectly, how friendly a disposition he had always exercised towards the Corinthians, and with what sincerity and kindness he had judged of them; for at the very time that they seemed to be unworthy of commendation, he still promised much that was honorable on their behalf. Here truly we have 			 a signal evidence of a rightly constituted and candid mind, — reproving to their face those that you love, and yet hoping well, and giving others good hopes respecting them. Such sincerity ought to have induced them not to take amiss any thing that proceeded from him. In the mean time, he takes this opportunity of setting before them again, in passing, his fidelity in all other matters. “You have hitherto had opportunity of knowing my candor, so that I have shown myself to be truthful, and not 			 by any means fickle. I rejoice, therefore, that I have now also been found truthful, when boasting of you before others.”</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p31"></a><b>15. </b><i>His bowels more abundantly.</i> As the <i>bowels </i>are the seat of the affections, the term is on that account employed to denote compassion, love, and every pious affection.   			  <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">657</font></a>
  			  He wished, however, to express emphatically the idea, that while Titus had loved the Corinthians previously, he had been, at that time, more vehemently stirred up to love them; and that, from the innermost affections of his heart. Now, by these words he insinuates Titus into the affections of the Corinthians, as it is of advantage that the servants of Christ should be loved, that they may have it in their power to do the more good. He at the same time encourages 			 them to go on well, that they may render themselves beloved by all the good.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p33"></a><i>With fear and trembling.</i> By these two words he sometimes expresses simply <i>respect, </i>(<a name="xiii.iv-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005">Eph 6:5</a><a name="xiii.iv-p33.1"></a>,) and this perhaps would not suit ill with this passage, though I should have no objection to view the <i>trembling</i> as mentioned particularly to mean, that, 			 being conscious of having acted amiss, they were afraid to face him. It is true that even those, that are resolute in their iniquities, tremble at the sight of the judge, but voluntary trembling, that proceeds from ingenuous shame, is a sign of repentance. Whichever exposition you may choose, this passage teaches, what is a right reception for the ministers of Christ. Assuredly, it is not sumptuous banquets, it is not splendid apparel, it is not courteous and honorable salutations, it is not 			 the plaudits of the multitude, that gratify the upright and faithful pastor. He experiences, on the other hand, an overflowing of delight, when the doctrine of salvation is received with reverence from his mouth, when he retains the authority that belongs to him for the edification of the Church, when the people give themselves up to his direction, to be regulated by his ministry under Christ’s banners. An example of this we see here in Titus. He at length, in the close, confirms again, what he 			 had previously stated — that he had never been offended to such a degree, as altogether to distrust the Corinthians.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.ii-p31"></a> “Timothy is despatched” (by Paul) “to Corinth, and after him Titus is sent. In the mean time, ‘a door is opened of the Lord’ to the Apostles to preach Christ’s gospel at Troas; but, strange to relate! he who panted so earnestly for such opportunities, had neither heart nor tongue to improve the present. The expected messenger from Corinth had not arrived — he had ‘no rest in his spirit,’ and abandoning the rich harvest which invited his 				  labors, he wandered into Macedonia. Nor yet did he find ease: ‘For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side — without were fightings; within were fears.’ At last Titus arrives with tidings from Corinth. The Apostle’s letter had been well received; it had produced the intended effects; a spirit of repentance had fallen upon the Church; they had applied themselves vigorously to the correction of abuses; the love which they bore to their spiritual 				  father had revived with additional strength. ‘Now! thanks be unto God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place!’ ‘Great is my boldness of speech towards you, great is my glorying of you; I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.’ (<a name="xiii.ii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014">2Co 2:14</a><a name="xiii.ii-p31.1"></a>; 				  <a name="xiii.ii-p31.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004">2Co 7:4</a><a name="xiii.ii-p31.2"></a>.) What a sudden change! what a wonderful transformation!
