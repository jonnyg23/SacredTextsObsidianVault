 <p><a name="vii.i-p8"></a><b>1.</b> Though Paul has clearly proved that bare circumcision brought nothing to the Jews, yet since he could not deny but that there was some difference between the Gentiles and the Jews, which by that symbol was sealed to them by the Lord, and since it was inconsistent to make a distinction, of which God was the author, void and of no moment, it remained for him to remove also this objection. It was 			 indeed evident, that it was a foolish glorying in which the Jews on this account indulged; yet still a doubt remained as to the design of circumcision; for the Lord would not have appointed it had not some benefit been intended. He therefore, by way of an objection, asks, what it was that made the Jew superior to the Gentile; and he subjoins a reason for this by another question, <i>What is the benefit of circumcision? </i>For this separated the Jews from the common class of men; it was a partition-wall, as Paul calls ceremonies, which kept parties asunder.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p9"></a><a name="vii.i-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p10"></a><b>2.</b> <i>Much in every way,</i> <i>etc.</i>; that is, very much. He begins here to give the sacrament its own praise; but he concedes not, that on this account the Jews ought to have been proud; for when he teaches that they were sealed by the symbol of circumcision, by which they 			 were counted the children of God, he does not allow that they became superior to others through any merit or worthiness of their own, but through the free mercy of God. If then regard be had to them as men, he shows that they were on a level with others; but if the favors of God be taken to the account, he admits that they possessed what made them more eminent than other men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p11"></a><i>First indeed, because, intrusted to them,</i> <i>etc.</i> Some think there is here an unfinished period, for he sets down what he does not afterwards complete. But the word <i>first </i>seems not to me to be a note of number, but means chiefly” or 			 especially,   			  <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a>
  			  and is to be taken in this sense — “Though it were but this one thing, that they have the oracles   			  <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>
  			  of God committed to them, it might be deemed sufficient to prove their superiority.” And it is worthy of being noticed, that the advantage of circumcision is not made to consist in the naked sign, but its value is derived from the word; for Paul asks here what benefit the sacrament conferred on the Jews, and he answers, that God had deposited with them the treasure of celestial wisdom. It hence follows, that, apart from the word, no 			 excellency remained. By <i>oracles</i> he means the covenant which God revealed first to Abraham and to his posterity, and afterwards sealed and unfolded by the law and the Prophets.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p14"></a>Now the oracles were committed to them, for the purpose of preserving them as long as it pleased the Lord to continue his glory among them, and then of publishing them during the time of their stewardship through the whole world: they were first depositories, and secondly dispensers. But if this benefit was to be so highly esteemed when the Lord favored one nation only with the revelation of his word, we can never sufficiently reprobate our 			 ingratitude, who receive his word with so much negligence or with so much carelessness, not to say disdain.</p>  <a name="vii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.ii-p8"></a><b>3.</b> <i>What indeed if some,</i> <i>etc.</i> As before, while regarding the Jews as exulting in the naked sign, he allowed them no not even a spark of glory; so now, while considering the nature of the sign, he testifies that its virtue (<a name="vii.ii-p8.1"></a><i>virtutem</i><i>, efficacy</i>) is not destroyed, no, not even by their inconstancy. As then he seemed before to have intimated that whatever grace there might have been in the sign of circumcision, it had wholly vanished through the ingratitude of the Jews, he now, anticipating an objection, again asks what opinion was to be formed of it. There is here indeed a sort of reticence, as he 			 expresses less than what he intended to be understood; for he might have truly said that a great part of the nation had renounced the covenant of God; but as this would have been very grating to the ears of the Jews, he mitigated its severity, and mentioned only some.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p9"></a><i>Shall their unbelief,</i> <i>etc.</i> <a name="vii.ii-p9.1"></a>Καταργεῖν is properly to render void and ineffectual; a meaning most suitable to this passage. For Paul’s inquiry is not so much whether the unbelief of men 			 neutralizes the truth of God, so that it should not in itself remain firm and constant, but whether it hinders its effect and fulfillment as to men. The meaning then is, “Since most of the Jews are covenant-breakers, is God’s covenant so abrogated by their perfidiousness that it brings forth no fruit among them? To this he answers, that it cannot be that the truth of God should lose its stability through man’s wickedness. Though then the greater part had nullified and trodden under foot God’s 			 covenant, it yet retained its efficacy and manifested its power, not indeed as to all, but with regard to a few of that nation: and it is then efficacious when the grace or the blessing of the Lord avails to eternal salvation. But this cannot be, except when the promise is received by faith; for it is in this way that a mutual covenant is on both sides confirmed. He then means that some ever remained in that nation, who by continuing to believe in the promise, had not fallen away from the 			 privileges of the covenant.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p10"></a><a name="vii.ii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p11"></a><b>4.</b> <i>But let God be true, etc.</i> Whatever may be the opinion of others, I regard this as an argument taken from the necessary consequence of what is opposed to it, by which Paul invalidates the preceding objection. For since these two things stand together, yea, necessarily accord, that God 			 is true and that man is false, it follows that the truth of God is not nullified by the falsehood of men; for except he did now set those two things in opposition, the one to the other, he would afterwards have in vain labored to refute what was absurd, and show how God is just, though he manifests his justice by our unjustice. Hence the meaning is by no means ambiguous, — that the faithfulness of God is so far from being nullified by the perfidy and apostasy of men that it thereby becomes more 			 evident. “<i>God</i>,” he says, “<i>is true,</i> not only because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but because he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks, that his command becomes a reality. On the other hand, <i>man is false,</i> not only because he often violates his pledged faith, but because he naturally seeks falsehood and 			 shuns the truth.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p12"></a>The first clause contains the primary axiom of all Christian philosophy; the latter is taken from <a name="vii.ii-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011">Ps 116:11</a><a name="vii.ii-p12.1"></a>, where David confesses that there is nothing certain from man or in man.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p13"></a>Now this is a remarkable passage, and contains a consolation that is much needed; for such is the perversity of men in rejecting and despising God’s word, that its truth would be often doubted were not this to come to our minds, that God’s verity depends not on man’s verity. But how does this agree with what has been said previously — that in order to make the divine promise effectual, faith, which receives it, is on the part of men 			 necessary? for faith stands opposed to falsehood. This seems, indeed, to be a difficult question; but it may with no great difficulty be answered, and in this way — the Lord, notwithstanding the lies of men, and though these are hinderances to his truth, does yet find a way for it through a pathless track, that he may come forth a conqueror, and that is, by correcting in his elect the inbred unbelief of our nature, and by subjecting to his service those who seem to be unconquerable. It must be 			 added, that the discourse here is concerning the corruption of nature, and not the grace of God, which is the remedy for that corruption.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p14"></a><i>That thou mightest be justified,</i> <i>etc.</i> The sense is, So far is it that the truth of God is destroyed by our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that it thereby shines forth and appears more evident, according to the testimony of David, who says, that as he was sinner, God was a just and righteous Judge in whatever he 			 determined respecting him, and that he would overcome all the calumnies of the ungodly who murmured against his righteousness. By the <i>words</i> of God, David means the judgments which he pronounces upon us; for the common application of these to promises is too strained: and so the particle <i>that, </i>is not so much final, nor refers to a far-fetched consequence, but implies an inference according to this 			 purport, “Against thee have I sinned; justly then dost thou punish me.” And that Paul has quoted this passage according to the proper and real meaning of David, is clear from the objection that is immediately added, “How shall the righteousness of God remain perfect if our iniquity illustrates it?” For in vain, as I have already observed, and unseasonable has Paul arrested the attention of his readers with this difficulty, except David meant, that God, in his wonderful providence, elicited from 			 the sins of men a praise to his own righteousness. The second clause in Hebrew is this, “And that thou mightest be pure in thy judgment;” which expression imports nothing else but that God in all his judgments is worthy of praise, how much soever the ungodly may clamor and strive by their complaints disgracefully to efface his glory. But Paul has followed the Greek version, which answered his purpose here even better. We indeed know that the Apostles in quoting Scripture often used a freer 			 language than the original; for they counted it enough to quote what was suitable to their subject: hence they made no great account of words.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p15"></a>The application then of this passage is the following: Since all the sins of mortals must serve to illustrate the glory of the Lord, and since he is especially glorified by his truth, it follows, that even the falsehood of men serves to confirm rather than to subvert his truth. Though the word <a name="vii.ii-p15.1"></a>κρίνεσθαι, may be taken actively as 			 well as passively, yet the Greek translators, I have no doubt, rendered it passively, contrary to the meaning of the Prophet.   			  <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.iii-p11"></a><b>5</b>  <i>But if our unrighteousness,</i> <i>etc.</i> Though this is a digression from the main subject, it was yet necessary for the Apostle to introduce it, lest he should seem to give to the ill-disposed an occasion to speak evil, which he knew would 			 be readily laid hold on by them. For since they were watching for every opportunity to defame the gospel, they had, in the testimony of David, what they might have taken for the purpose of founding a calumny, — “If God seeks nothing else, but to be glorified by men, why does he punish them, when they offend, since by offending they glorify him? Without cause then surely is he offended, if he derives the reason of his displeasure from that by which he is glorified.” There is, indeed, no doubt, 			 but that this was an ordinary, and everywhere a common calumny, as it will presently appear. Hence Paul could not have covertly passed it by; but that no one should think that he expressed the sentiments of his own mind, he premises that he assumes the person of the ungodly; and at the same time, he sharply, touches, by a single expression, on human reason; whose work, as he intimates, is ever to bark against the wisdom of God; for he says not, “according to the ungodly,” but “according to 			 man,” or as man. And thus indeed it is, for all the mysteries of God are paradoxes to the flesh: and at the same tine it possesses so much audacity, that it fears not to oppose them and insolently to assail what it cannot comprehend. We are hence reminded, that if we desire to become capable of understanding them, we must especially labor to become freed from our own reason, (<a name="vii.iii-p11.1"></a><i>proprio sensu</i>) and to give up ourselves, and unreservedly to submit to his word. — The word <i>wrath,</i> taken here for judgment, refers to punishment; as though he said, “Is God unjust, who punishes those sins which set forth his righteousness?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p12"></a><a name="vii.iii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p13"></a><b>6.</b> <i>By no means,</i> <i>etc.</i> In checking this blasphemy he gives not a direct reply to the objection, but begins with expressing his abhorrence of it, lest the Christian religion should even appear to include absurdities so great. And this is more weighty than if he 			 adopted a simple denial; for he implies, that this impious expression deserved to be regarded with horror, and not to be heard. He presently subjoins what may be called an indirect refutation; for he does not distinctly refute the calumny, but gives only this reply, — that the objection was absurd. Moreover, he takes an argument from an office which belongs to God, by which he proves it to be impossible, — <i>God shall judge the 			 world;</i> he cannot then be unjust.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p14"></a>This argument is not derived, so to speak, from the mere power of God, but from his exercised power, which shines forth in the whole arrangement and order of his works; as though he said, — “It is God’s work to judge the world, that is, to rectify it by his own righteousness, and to reduce to the best order whatever there is in it out of order: he cannot then determine any thing unjustly.” And he seems to allude to a passage recorded by 			 Moses, in <a name="vii.iii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025">Ge 18:25</a><a name="vii.iii-p14.1"></a>, where it is said, that when Abraham prayed God not to deliver Sodom wholly to destruction, he spoke to this purpose, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p15"></a>“It is not meet, that thou who art to judge the earth, shouldest destroy the just with the ungodly: for this is not thy work nor can it be done by thee.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p16"></a>A similar declaration is found in <a name="vii.iii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017">Job 34:17</a><a name="vii.iii-p16.1"></a>, —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.iii-p17"></a>“Should he who hates judgment exercise power?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p18"></a>For though there are found among men unjust judges, yet this happens, because they usurp authority contrary to law and right, or because they are inconsiderately raised to that eminence, or because they degenerate from themselves. But there is nothing of this kind with regard to God. Since, then, he is by nature judge, it must be that he is just, for he cannot deny himself. Paul then proves from what is impossible, that God is absurdly 			 accused of unrighteousness; for to him peculiarly and naturally belongs the work of justly governing the world. And though what Paul teaches extends to the constant government of God, yet I allow that it has a special reference to the last judgment; for then only a real restoration of just order will take place. But if you wish for a direct refutation, by which profane things of this kind may be checked, take this, and say, “That it comes not through what unrighteousness is, that God’s 			 righteousness becomes more illustrious, but that our wickedness is so surpassed by God’s goodness, that it is turned to serve an end different from that to which it tends.”</p>

  			  <i>the truth of God,</i> <i>etc.</i> This objection, I have no doubt, is adduced in the person of the ungodly; for it is a sort of an explanation of the former verse, and would have been connected with it, had not the Apostle, moved with indignation, broken off the sentence in the middle. The meaning of the 			 objection is — “If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God’s glory, should be punished as a sinner.”   			  <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.iii-p24"></a><b>8.</b> <i>And not,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is an elliptical sentence, in which a word is to be understood. It will be complete, if you read it thus, — “and why is it not rather said, (as we are reproached, etc.) that we are to do evils, that good things 			 may come?” But the Apostle deigns not to answer the slander; which yet we may check by the most solid reason. The pretense, indeed, is this, — “If God is by our iniquity glorified, and if nothing can be done by man in this life more befitting than to promote the glory of God, then let us sin to advance his glory!” Now the answer to this is evident, — “That evil cannot of itself produce anything but evil; and that God’s glory is through our sin illustrated, is not the work of man, but the work 			 of God; who, as a wonderful worker, knows how to overcome our wickedness, and to convert it to another end, so as to turn it contrary to what we intend, to the promotion of his own glory.” God has prescribed to us the way, by which he would have himself to be glorified by us, even by true piety, which consists in obedience to his word. He who leaps over this boundary, strives not to honor God, but to dishonor him. That it turns out otherwise, is to be ascribed to the Providence of God, and not 			 to the wickedness of man; through which it comes not, that the majesty of God is not injured, nay, wholly overthrown   			  <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">94</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p26"></a><i>(As we are reproached,)</i> <i>etc.</i> Since Paul speaks so reverently of the secret judgments of God, it is a wonder that his enemies should have fallen into such wantonness as to calumniate him: but there has never been so much reverence and seriousness displayed by God’s servants as to be sufficient to check impure 			 and virulent tongues. It is not then a new thing, that adversaries at this day load with so many false accusations, and render odious our doctrine, which we ourselves know to be the pure gospel of Christ, and all the angels, as well as the faithful, are our witnesses. Nothing can be imagined more monstrous than what we read here was laid to the charge of Paul, to the end, that his preaching might be rendered hateful to the inexperienced. Let us then bear this evil, when the ungodly abuse the 			 truth which we preach by their calumnies: nor let us cease, on this account, constantly to defend the genuine confession of it, inasmuch as it has sufficient power to crush and to dissipate their falsehoods. Let us, at the same time, according to the Apostle’s example, oppose, as much as we can, all malicious subtilties, (<a name="vii.iii-p26.1"></a><i>technis</i> — crafts, wiles,) that the base and the abandoned may not, 			 without some check, speak evil of our Creator.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iii-p27"></a><i>Whose judgment is just.</i> Some take this in an active sense, as signifying that Paul so far assents to them, that what they objected was absurd, in order that the doctrine of the gospel might not be thought to be connected with such paradoxes: but I approve more of the passive meaning; for it would not have been suitable simply to express an approval of such a 			 wickedness, which, on the contrary, deserved to be severely condemned; and this is what Paul seems to me to have done. And their perverseness was, on two accounts, to be condemned, — first, because this impiety had gained the assent of their minds; and secondly, because, in traducing the gospel, they dared to draw from it their calumny.</p>  <a name="vii.iv"></a>

For lest the Jews should object that they were deprived of their right, as he had mentioned those distinctions of honor, for which they thought themselves superior to the Gentiles, he now at length replies to the question — in 			 what respect they excelled the Gentiles. And though his answer seems in appearance to militate against what he had said before, (for he now strips those of all dignity to whom he had attributed so much,) there is yet no discord; for those privileges in which he allowed them to be eminent, were separate from themselves, and dependent on God’s goodness, and not on their own merit: but here he makes inquiry as to their own worthiness, whether they could glory in any respect in themselves. Hence 			 the two answers he gives so agree together, that the one follows from the other; for while he extols their privileges, by including them among the free benefits of God, he shows that they had nothing of their own. Hence, what he now answers might have been easily inferred; for since it was their chief superiority, that God’s oracles were deposited with them, and they had it not through their own merit, there was nothing left for them, on account of which they could glory before God. Now mark 			 the holy contrivance (<a name="vii.iv-p6.1"></a><i>sanctum artificium</i>) which he adopts; for when he ascribes pre-eminency to them, he speaks in the third person; but when he strips them of all things, he puts himself among them, that he might avoid giving offense.</p>

We must add, that to be under sin means that we are justly condemned as sinners before God, or that we are held under the curse which is due to sin; for as righteousness brings with it absolution, so sin is followed by condemnation.</p>  <a name="vii.v"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.v-p23"></a><i>There is none righteous,</i> <i>etc.</i> The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet declares to be in man, and that is — <i>that none is 			 righteous; </i>  			  <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">98</font></a>

  			 he repeats again, in other words, what we have noticed at the beginning — that every wickedness flows from a disregard of God: for as the principal part of wisdom is the fear of God, when we depart from that, there remains in us nothing right or pure. In short, as it is a bridle to restrain our wickedness, so when it is wanting, we feel at liberty to indulge every kind of licentiousness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.v-p47"></a>And that these testimonies may not seem to any one to have been unfitly produced, let us consider each of them in connection with the passages from which they have been taken. David says in <a name="vii.v-p47.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001">Ps 14:1</a><a name="vii.v-p47.1"></a>, that there was such perverseness in men, that God, when looking on them all in their different conditions, could not find a righteous man, no, not one. It then 			 follows, that this evil pervaded mankind universally; for nothing is hid from the sight of God. He speaks indeed at the end of the Psalm of the redemption of Israel: but we shall presently show how men become holy, and how far they are exempt from this condition. In the other Psalms he speaks of the treachery of his enemies, while he was exhibiting in himself and in his descendants a type of the kingdom of Christ: hence we have in his adversaries the representatives of all those, who being 			 alienated from Christ, are not led by his Spirit. Isaiah expressly mentions Israel; and therefore his charge applies with still greater force against the Gentiles. What, then? There is no doubt but that the character of men is described in those words, in order that we may see what man is when left to himself; for Scripture testifies that all men are in this state, who are not regenerated by the grace of God. The condition of the saints would be nothing better, were not this depravity corrected 			 in them: and that they may still remember that they differ nothing from others by nature, they do find in the relics of their flesh (by which they are always encompassed) the seeds of those evils, which would constantly produce fruits, were they not prevented by being mortified; and for this mortification they are indebted to God’s mercy and not to their own nature. We may add, that though all the vices here enumerated are not found conspicuously in every individual, yet they may be justly and 			 truly ascribed to human nature, as we have already observed on <a name="vii.v-p47.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026">Romans 1:26</a><a name="vii.v-p47.3"></a>.</p>  <a name="vii.vi"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.vi-p8"></a><b>19.</b> <i>Now we know,</i> <i>etc.</i> Leaving the Gentiles, he distinctly addresses his words to the Jews; for he had a much more difficult work in subduing them, because they, though no less destitute of true righteousness than the Gentiles, yet covered 			 themselves with the cloak of God’s covenant, as though it was a sufficient holiness to them to have been separated from the rest of the world by the election of God. And he indeed mentions those evasions which he well understood the Jews were ready to bring forward; for whatever was said in the law unfavorably of mankind, they usually applied to the Gentiles, as though they were exempt from the common condition of men, and no doubt they would have been so, had they not fallen from their own 			 dignity. Hence, that no false conceit as to their own worthiness should be a hinderance to them, and that they might not confine to the Gentiles alone what applied to them in common with others, Paul here anticipates them, and shows, from what Scripture declares, that they were not only blended with the multitude, but that condemnation was peculiarly denounced on them. And we indeed see the discretion of the Apostle in undertaking to refute these objections; for to whom but to the Jews had the 			 law been given, and to whose instruction but theirs ought it to have served? What then it states respecting others is as it were accidental; or as they say, <a name="vii.vi-p8.1"></a>παρεργον, an appendage; but it applies its teaching mainly to its own disciples.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vi-p9"></a><i>Under the law</i> He says that the Jews were those to whom the law was destined, it hence follows, that it especially regards them; and under the word law he includes also the Prophets, and so the whole of the Old Testament  — <i>That every 			 mouth may be stopped,</i> <i>etc.</i>; that is, that every evasion may be cut off, and every occasion for excuse. It is a metaphor taken from courts of law, where the accused, if he has anything to plead as a lawful defense, demands leave to speak, that he might clear himself from the things laid to his charge; but if he is convicted by his own conscience, he is silent, and without saying a word 			 waits for his condemnation, being even already by his own silence condemned. Of the same meaning is this saying in <a name="vii.vi-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004">Job 40:4</a><a name="vii.vi-p9.1"></a>, “I will lay my hand on my mouth.” He indeed says, that though he was not altogether without some kind of excuse, he would yet cease to justify himself, and submit to the sentence of God. The next clause contains the explanation; for his mouth is stopped, who is so fast 			 held by the sentence of condemnation, that he can by no means escape. According to another sense, to be silent before the Lord is to tremble at his majesty, and to stand mute, being astonished at his brightness.   			  <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.vi-p11"></a><a name="vii.vi-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vi-p12"></a><b>20.</b> <i>Therefore by the works of the law,</i> <i>etc.</i> It is a matter of doubt, even among the learned, what the works of the law mean. Some extend them to the observance of the whole law, while others confine them to the ceremonies alone. The 			 addition of the word <i>law</i> induced <a name="vii.vi-p12.1"></a>Chrysostom<i>, </i><a name="vii.vi-p12.2"></a>Origen, and <a name="vii.vi-p12.3"></a>Jerome to assent to the latter opinion;   			  <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
  			  for they thought that there is a peculiar intimation in this appendage, that the expression should not be understood as including all works. But this difficulty may be very easily removed: for seeing works are so far just before God as we seek by them to render to him worship and obedience, in order expressly to take away the power of justifying from all works, he has mentioned those, if there be any, which can possibly justify; for the law 			 hath promises, without which there would be no value in our works before God. You hence see the reason why Paul expressly mentioned the works of the law; for it is by the law that a reward is apportioned to works. Nor was this unknown to the schoolmen, who held it as an approved and common maxim, that works have no intrinsic worthiness, but become meritorious by covenant. And though they were mistaken, inasmuch as they saw not that works are ever polluted with vices, which deprive them of any 			 merit, yet this principle is still true, that the reward for works depends on the free promise of the law. Wisely then and rightly does Paul speak here; for he speaks not of mere works, but distinctly and expressly refers to the keeping of the law, the subject which he is discussing.   			  <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vi-p17"></a>As to those things which have been adduced by learned men in defense of this opinion, they are weaker than they might have been. They think that by mentioning circumcision, an example is propounded, which belonged to ceremonies only: but why Paul mentioned circumcision, we have already explained; for none swell more with confidence in works than hypocrites, and we know that they glory only in external masks; and then circumcision, according 			 to their view, was a sort of initiation into the righteousness of the law; and hence it seemed to them a work of primary excellence, and indeed the basis as it were of the righteousness of works. — They also allege what is said in the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul handles the same subject, and refers to ceremonies only; but that also is not sufficiently strong to support what they wish to defend. It is certain that Paul had a controversy with those who inspired the people with a false 			 confidence in ceremonies; that he might cut of this confidence, he did not confine himself to ceremonies, nor did he speak specifically of what value they were; but he included the whole law, as it is evident from those passages which are derived from that source. Such also was the character of the disputation held at Jerusalem by the disciples.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vi-p18"></a>But we contend, not without reason, that Paul speaks here of the whole law; for we are abundantly supported by the thread of reasoning which he has hitherto followed and continues to follow, and there are many other passages which will not allow us to think otherwise. It is therefore a truth, which deserves to be remembered as the first in importance, — that by keeping the law no one can attain righteousness. He had before 			 assigned the reason, and he will repeat it presently again, and that is, that all, being to a man guilty of transgression, are condemned for unrighteousness by the law. And these two things — to be justified by works — and to be guilty of transgressions, (as we shall show more at large as we proceed,) are wholly inconsistent the one with the other. — The word <i>flesh,</i> without some 			 particular specification, signifies men;   			  <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a>
  			  though it seems to convey a meaning somewhat more general, as it is more expressive to say, “All mortals,” than to say, “All men,” as you may see in <i>Gallius.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vi-p20"></a><i>For by the law,</i> <i>etc.</i> He reasons from what is of an opposite character, — that righteousness is not brought to us by the law, because it convinces us of sin and condemns us; for life and death proceed not from the same fountain. And as he reasons from the contrary effect of the law, that 			 it cannot confer righteousness on us, let us know, that the argument does not otherwise hold good, except we hold this as an inseparable and unvarying circumstance, — that by showing to man his sin, it cuts off the hope of salvation. It is indeed by itself, as it teaches us what righteousness is, the way to salvation: but our depravity and corruption prevent it from being in this respect of any advantage to us. It is also necessary in the second place to add this, — that whosoever is found to 			 be a sinner, is deprived of righteousness; for to devise with the sophisters a half kind of righteousness, so that works in part justify, is frivolous: but nothing is in this respect gained, on account of man’s corruption.</p>  <a name="vii.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.vii-p8"></a><b>21.</b> <i>But now without the law,</i> <i>etc.</i> It is not certain for what distinct reason he calls that the righteousness of God, which we obtain by faith; whether it be, because it can alone stand before God, or because the Lord in his mercy confers 			 it on us. As both interpretations are suitable, we contend for neither. This righteousness then, which God communicates to man, and accepts alone, and owns as righteousness, has been revealed, he says,<i> without the law,</i> that is without the aid of the law; and the law is to be understood as meaning works; for it is not proper to refer this to its teaching, which he immediately adduces as bearing witness to the gratuitous righteousness of faith. 			 Some confine it to ceremonies; but this view I shall presently show to be unsound and frigid. We ought then to know, that the merits of works are excluded. We also see that he blends not works with the mercy of God; but having taken away and wholly removed all confidence in works, he sets up mercy alone.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p9"></a>It is not unknown to me, that <a name="vii.vii-p9.1"></a>Augustine gives a different explanation; for he thinks that the righteousness of God is the grace of regeneration; and this grace he allows to be free, because God renews us, when unworthy, by his Spirit; and from this he excludes the works of the law, that is, those works, by which men of themselves endeavor, without renovation, to render God indebted to them. (<a name="vii.vii-p9.2"></a><i>Deum promereri</i> — to oblige God.) I also well know, that some new speculators proudly adduce this sentiment, as though it were at this day revealed to them. But that the Apostle includes all works without exception, even those which the Lord produces in his own people, is evident from the context.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p10"></a>For no doubt Abraham was regenerated and led by the Spirit of God at the time when he denied that he was justified by works. Hence he excluded from man’s justification not only works morally good, as they commonly call them, and such as are done by the impulse of nature, but also all those which even the faithful can perform.  			  <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">110</font></a>
  			 Again, since this is a definition of the righteousness of faith, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,” there is no question to be made about this or that kind of work; but the merit of works being abolished, the remission of sins alone is set down as the cause of righteousness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p12"></a>They think that these two things well agree, — that man is justified by faith through the grace of Christ, — and that he is yet justified by the works, which proceed from spiritual regeneration; for God gratuitously renews us, and we also receive his gift by faith. But Paul takes up a very different principle, — that the consciences of men will never be tranquillized until they recumb on the mercy of God alone.  			  <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">111</font></a>
  			 Hence, in another place, after having taught us that God is in Christ justifying men, he expresses the manner, — “by not imputing to them their sins.” In like manner, in his Epistle to the Galatians, he puts the law in opposition to faith with regard to justification; for the law promises life to those who do what it commands, (<a name="vii.vii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012">Ga 3:12</a><a name="vii.vii-p13.2"></a>;) and it requires not only the outward performance of 			 works, but also sincere love to God. It hence follows, that in the righteousness of faith, no merit of works is allowed. It then appears evident, that it is but a frivolous sophistry to say, that we are justified in Christ, because we are renewed by the Spirit, inasmuch as we are the members of Christ, — that we are justified by faith, because we are united by faith to the body of Christ, — that we are justified freely, because God finds nothing in us but sin.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p14"></a>But we are <i>in Christ</i> because we are out of ourselves; and justified by <i>faith,</i> because we must recumb on the mercy of God alone, and on his gratuitous promises; and<i> freely,</i> because God reconciles us to himself by burying our sins. Nor can this indeed be confined to the commencement of justification, as they dream; for this definition — “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven” — was applicable to David, after he 			 had long exercised himself in the service of God; and Abraham, thirty years after his call, though a remarkable example of holiness, had yet no works for which he could glory before God, and hence his faith in the promise was imputed to him for righteousness; and when Paul teaches us that God justifies men by not imputing their sins, he quotes a passage, which is daily repeated in the Church. Still more, the conscience, by which we are disturbed on the score of works, performs its office, not 			 for one day only, but continues to do so through life. It hence follows that we cannot remain, even to death, in a justified state, except we look to Christ only, in whom God has adopted us, and regards us now as accepted. Hence also is their sophistry confuted, who falsely accuse us of asserting, that according to Scripture we are justified by faith only, while the exclusive word <i>only,</i> is nowhere to be found in Scripture. But if justification depends not either on the law, or on 			 ourselves, why should it not be ascribed to mercy alone? and if it be from mercy only, it is then by faith only.</p>

  			  But if you prefer to regard it as an adverb of time, I willingly admit it, so that there may be no room to suspect an evasion; yet the abrogation of ceremonies alone is not to be understood; for it was only the design of the Apostle to illustrate by a comparison the grace by which we excel the fathers. Then the meaning is, that by the preaching of the gospel, after the appearance of Christ in the flesh, the righteousness of faith was 			 revealed. It does not, however, hence follow, that it was hid before the coming of Christ; for a twofold manifestation is to be here noticed: the first in the Old Testament, which was by the word and sacraments; the other in the New, which contains the completion of ceremonies and promises, as exhibited in Christ himself: and we may add, that by the gospel it has received a fuller brightness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p17"></a><i>Being proved</i> [<i>or approved</i>] <i>by the testimony</i>,   			  <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">113</font></a>
  			  <i>etc.</i> He adds this, lest in the conferring of free righteousness the gospel should seem to militate against the law. As then he has denied that the righteousness of faith needs the aid of the law, so now he asserts that it is confirmed by its testimony. If then the law affords its testimony to gratuitous righteousness, it is evident that the law was not given for this end, to teach men how to obtain righteousness by 			 works. Hence they pervert it, who turn it to answer any purpose of this kind. And further, if you desire a proof of this truth, examine in order the chief things taught by Moses, and you will find that man, being cast from the kingdom of God, had no other restoration from the beginning than that contained in the evangelical promises through the blessed seed, by whom, as it had been foretold, the serpent’s head was to be bruised, and through whom a blessing to the nations had been promised: you 			 will find in the commandments a demonstration of your iniquity, and from the sacrifices and oblations you may learn that satisfaction and cleansing are to be obtained in Christ alone.   			  <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">114</font></a>
  			  When you come to the <i>Prophets</i> you will find the clearest promises of gratuitous mercy. On this subject see my Institutes.</p>

  			  He shows in few words what this justification is, even that which is found in Christ and is apprehended by faith. At the same time, by introducing again the name of God, he seems to make God the founder, (<a name="vii.vii-p22.3"></a><i>autorem</i><i>,</i> the author,) and not only the approver of the righteousness of which he speaks; as though he had 			 said, that it flows from him alone, or that its origin is from heaven, but that it is made manifest to us in Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.vii-p23"></a>When therefore we discuss this subject, we ought to proceed in this way: <i>First,</i> the question respecting our justification is to be referred, not to the judgment of men, but to the judgment of God, before whom nothing is counted righteousness, but perfect and absolute obedience to the law; which appears clear from its promises and threatenings: if no one is found who has attained to such a perfect measure of holiness, it follows that 			 all are in themselves destitute of righteousness. <i>Secondly,</i> it is necessary that Christ should come to our aid; who, being alone just, can render us just by transferring to us his own righteousness. You now see how the righteousness of faith is the righteousness of Christ. When therefore we are justified, the efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the instrumental is the word in connection with faith.  			  <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">116</font></a>
  			 Hence faith is said to justify, because it is the instrument by which we receive Christ, in whom righteousness is conveyed to us. Having been made partakers of Christ, we ourselves are not only just, but our works also are counted just before God, and for this reason, because whatever imperfections there may be in them, are obliterated by the blood of Christ; the promises, which are conditional, are also by the same grace fulfilled to us; for God rewards our works as perfect, inasmuch 			 as their defects are covered by free pardon.</p>

  			  <i>etc.</i> For the sake of amplifying, he repeats the same thing in different forms; it was, that he might more fully express what we have already heard, that faith alone is required, that the faithful are not distinguished by external marks, and that hence it matters not whether they be Gentiles or Jews.</p>  <a name="vii.viii"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.viii-p11"></a><b>23.</b> <i>There is indeed no difference,</i> <i>etc.</i> He urges on all, without exception, the necessity of seeking righteousness in Christ; as though he had said, “There is no other way of attaining righteousness; for some cannot be justified in this and others in that 			 way; but all must alike be justified by faith, because all are sinners, and therefore have nothing for which they can glory before God.” But he takes as granted that every one, conscious of his sin, when he comes before the tribunal of God, is confounded and lost under a sense of his own shame; so that no <i>sinner</i> can bear the presence of God, as we see an example in the case of Adam. He again brings forward a reason taken from the opposite side; 			 and hence we must notice what follows. Since we are all sinners, Paul concludes, that we are deficient in, or <i>destitute</i> of, the praise due to righteousness. There is then, according to what he teaches, no righteousness but what is perfect and absolute. Were there indeed such a thing as half righteousness, it would yet be necessary to deprive the sinner entirely of all glory: and hereby the figment of partial righteousness, as they call it, is 			 sufficiently confuted; for if it were true that we are justified in part by works, and in part by grace, this argument of Paul would be of no force — that all are deprived of the glory of God because they are sinners. It is then certain, there is no righteousness where there is sin, until Christ removes the curse; and this very thing is what is said in <a name="vii.viii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010">Ga 3:10</a><a name="vii.viii-p11.1"></a>, that all who 			 are under the law are exposed to the curse, and that we are delivered from it through the kindness of Christ. <i>The glory of God</i> I take to mean the approbation of God, as in <a name="vii.viii-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043">Joh 12:43</a><a name="vii.viii-p11.2"></a>, where it is said, that “they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.” And thus he summons us from 			 the applause of a human court to the tribunal of heaven.   			  <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">118</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.viii-p14"></a><b>24.</b> <i>Being justified freely,</i> <i>etc.</i> A participle is here put for a verb according to the usage of the Greek language. The meaning is, — that since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten by the just 			 judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his mercy; for Christ comes to the aid of this misery, and communicates himself to believers, so that they find in him alone all those things in which they are wanting. There is, perhaps, no passage in the whole Scripture which illustrates in a more striking manner the efficacy of his righteousness; for it shows that God’s mercy is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the formal or the instumental 			 cause is faith in the word, and that moreover, the final cause is the glory of the divine justice and goodness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p15"></a>With regard to the efficient cause, he says, that we are <i>justified freely,</i> and further, by his grace; and he thus repeats the word to show that the whole is from God, and nothing from us. It might have been enough to oppose grace to merits; but lest we should imagine a half kind of grace, he affirms more strongly what he means by a 			 repetition, and claims for God’s mercy alone the whole glory of our righteousness, which the sophists divide into parts and mutilate, that they may not be constrained to confess their own poverty. — <i>Through the redemption,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is the material, — Christ by his obedience satisfied the Father’s justice, (<a name="vii.viii-p15.1"></a><i>judicium</i> — judgment,) and by undertaking our cause he liberated us from the tyranny of death, by which we were held captive; as on account of the sacrifice which he offered is our guilt removed. Here again is fully confuted the gloss of those who make righteousness a quality; for if we are counted righteous before God, because we are redeemed by a price, we certainly derive from another what is not in 			 us. And Paul immediately explains more clearly what this redemption is, and what is its object, which is to reconcile us to God; for he calls Christ a propitiation, (or, if we prefer an allusion to an ancient type,) a propitiatory. But what he means is, that we are not otherwise just than through Christ propitiating the Father for us. But it is necessary for us to examine the words.   			  <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">119</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.viii-p20"></a><b>25.</b> <i>Whom God hath set forth,</i> <i>etc.</i> The Greek verb, <a name="vii.viii-p20.1"></a>προτίθεναι, means sometimes to determine beforehand, and sometimes to set forth. If the first meaning be 			 taken, Paul refers to the gratuitous mercy of God, in having appointed Christ as our Mediator, that he might appease the Father by the sacrifice of his death: nor is it a small commendation of God’s grace that he, of his own good will, sought out a way by which he might remove our curse. According to this view, the passage fully harmonizes with that in <a name="vii.viii-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016">Joh 3:16</a><a name="vii.viii-p20.2"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.viii-p21"></a>“God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p22"></a>Yet if we embrace this meaning, it will remain still true, that God hath set him forth in due time, whom he had appointed as a Mediator. There seems to be an allusion in the word, ἱλαστήριον, as I have said, to the ancient propitiatory; for he teaches us that the same thing was really exhibited in Christ, which had been previously typified. As, 			 however, the other view cannot be disproved, should any prefer it, I shall not undertake to decide the question. What Paul especially meant here is no doubt evident from his words; and it was this, — that God, without having regard to Christ, is always angry with us, — and that we are reconciled to him when we are accepted through his righteousness. God does not indeed hate in us his own workmanship, that is, as we are formed men; but he hates our uncleanness, which has extinguished the light 			 of his image. When the washing of Christ cleanses this away, he then loves and embraces us as his own pure workmanship.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p23"></a><i>A propitiatory through faith in his blood,</i> <i>etc.</i> I prefer thus literally to retain the language of Paul; for it seems indeed to me that he intended, by one single sentence, to declare that God is propitious to us as soon as we have our trust resting on the blood of Christ; for by 			 faith we come to the possession of this benefit. But by mentioning <i>blood</i> only, he did not mean to exclude other things connected with redemption, but, on the contrary, to include the whole under one word: and he mentioned “blood,” because by it we are cleansed. Thus, by taking a part for the whole, he points out the whole work of expiation. For, as he had said before, that God is reconciled in Christ, so he now adds, 			 that this reconciliation is obtained by faith, mentioning, at the same time, what it is that faith ought mainly to regard in Christ — his blood.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p24"></a><i>For </i><a name="vii.viii-p24.1"></a>(<a name="vii.viii-p24.2"></a><a name="vii.viii-p24.3"></a>propter<a name="vii.viii-p24.4"></a>)<i> the remission of sins, </i>  			  <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">120</font></a>
  			  <i>etc.</i> The causal preposition imports as much as though he had said, “for the sake of remission,” or, “to this end, that he might blot out sins.” And this definition or explanation again confirms what I have already often reminded you, — that men are pronounced just, not because they are such in reality, but by imputation: for he only uses various modes of expression, that he might more clearly declare, that in this 			 righteousness there is no merit of ours; for if we obtain it by the remission of sins, we conclude that it is not from ourselves; and further, since remission itself is an act of God’s bounty alone, every merit falls to the ground.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p31"></a>It may, however, be asked, why he confines pardon to preceding sins? Though this passage is variously explained, yet it seems to me probable that Paul had regard to the legal expiations, which were indeed evidences of a future satisfaction, but could by no means pacify God. There is a similar passage in <a name="vii.viii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015">Heb 9:15</a><a name="vii.viii-p31.1"></a>, where it is said, that by Christ a 			 redemption was brought from sins, which remained under the former Testament. You are not, however, to understand that no sins but those of former times were expiated by the death of Christ — a delirious notion, which some fanatics have drawn from a distorted view of this passage. For Paul teaches us only this, — that until the death of Christ there was no way of appeasing God, and that this was not done or accomplished by the legal types: hence the reality was suspended until the fullness of 			 time came. We may further say, that those things which involve us daily in guilt must be regarded in the same light; for there is but one true expiation for all.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p32"></a>Some, in order to avoid what seems inconsistent, have held that former sins are said to have been forgiven, lest there should seem to he a liberty given to sin in future. It is indeed true that no pardon is offered but for sins committed; not that the benefit of redemption fails or is lost, when we afterwards fall, as <i>Novatus</i> and his sect dreamed, but that it is the character of the dispensation of the gospel, to set before him who 			 will sin the judgment and wrath of God, and before the sinner his mercy. But what I have already stated is the real sense.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p33"></a>He adds, that this remission was <i>through forbearance;</i> and this I take simply to mean gentleness, which has stayed the judgment of God, and suffered it not to burst forth to our ruin, until he had at length received us into favor. But there seems to be here also an implied anticipation of what might be said; 			 that no one might object, and say that this favor had only of late appeared. Paul teaches us, that it was an evidence of forbearance.</p>

  			  <i>etc.</i> The repetition of this clause is emphatical; and Paul resignedly made it, as it was very needful; for nothing is more difficult than to persuade man that he ought to disclaim all things as his own, and to ascribe them all to God. At the same time mention was intentionally made twice of this demonstration, that the Jews might open their eyes to behold it. — <i>At this time,</i> <i>etc.</i> What had been ever at all times, he applies to the time when Christ was revealed, and not without reason; for what was formerly known in an obscure manner under shadows, God openly manifested in his Son. So the coming of Christ was the time of his good pleasure, and the day of salvation. God had indeed in all ages given some evidence of his 			 righteousness; but it appeared far brighter when the sun of righteousness shone. Noticed, then, ought to be the comparison between the Old and the New Testament; for then only was revealed the righteousness of God when Christ appeared.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.viii-p37"></a><i>That he might be just,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is a definition of that righteousness which he has declared was revealed when Christ was given, and which, as he has taught us in the first chapter, is made known in the gospel: and he affirms that it consists of two parts — The first is, that God is 			 just, not indeed as one among many, but as one who contains within himself all fullness of righteousness; for complete and full praise, such as is due, is not otherwise given to him, but when he alone obtains the name and the honor of being just, while the whole human race is condemned for injustice: and then the other part refers to the communication of righteousness; for God by no means keeps his riches laid up in himself, but pours them forth upon men. Then the righteousness of God shines in 			 us, whenever he justifies us by faith in Christ; for in vain were Christ given us for righteousness, unless there was the fruition of him by faith. It hence follows, that all were unjust and lost in themselves, until a remedy from heaven was offered to them.   			  <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">122</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.ix-p8"></a><b>27.</b> <i>Where then is glorying?</i> The Apostle, after having, with reasons abundantly strong, cast down men from their confidence in works, now triumphs over their folly: and this exulting conclusion was necessary; for on this subject, to teach us would not have been enough; it was necessary that the Holy Spirit should 			 loudly thunder, in order to lay prostrate our loftiness. But he says that glorying is beyond all doubt excluded, for we cannot adduce anything of our own, which is worthy of being approved or commended by God. If the material of glorying be merit, whether you name that of congruity or of condignity, by which man would conciliate God, you see that both are here annihilated; for he treats not of the lessening or the modifying of merit, but Paul leaves not a particle behind. Besides, since by 			 faith glorying in works is so taken away, that faith cannot be truly preached, without wholly depriving man of all praise by ascribing all to God’s mercy — it follows, that we are assisted by no works in obtaining righteousness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ix-p9"></a><i>Of works?</i> In what sense does the Apostle deny here, that our merits are excluded by the law, since he has before proved that we are condemned by the law? For if the law delivers us over to death, what glorying can we obtain from it? Does it not on the contrary deprive us of all glorying and cover us with shame? He then indeed showed, that our sin is laid open by 			 what the law declares, for the keeping of it is what we have all neglected: but he means here, that were righteousness to be had by the law of works, our glorying would not be excluded; but as it is by faith alone, there is nothing that we can claim for ourselves; for faith receives all from God, and brings nothing except an humble confession of want.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ix-p10"></a>This contrast between faith and works ought to be carefully noticed: works are here mentioned without any limitation, even works universally. Then he neither speaks of ceremonies only, nor specifically of any external work, but includes all the merits of works which can possibly be imagined.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ix-p11"></a>The name of <i>law</i> is here, with no strict correctness, given to faith: but this by no means obscures the meaning of the Apostle; for what he understands is, that when we come to the rule of faith, the whole glorying in works is laid prostrate; as though he said — “The righteousness of works is indeed commended by 			 the law, but that of faith has its own law, which leaves to works, whatever they may be, no righteousness.”   			  <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">124</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.ix-p14"></a><b>28.</b> <i>We then conclude, etc.</i> He now draws the main proposition, as one that is incontrovertible, and adds an explanation. Justification by faith is indeed made very clear, while works are expressly excluded. Hence, in nothing do our adversaries labor more in the present day than in 			 attempts to blend faith with the merits of works. They indeed allow that man is justified by faith; but not by faith alone; yea, they place the efficacy of justification in love, though in words they ascribe it to faith. But Paul affirms in this passage that justification is so gratuitous, that he makes it quite evident, that it can by no means be associated with the merit of works. Why he names the works of the law, I have already explained; and I have also proved that it is quite absurd to 			 confine them to ceremonies. Frigid also is the gloss, that works are to be taken for those which are outward, and done without the Spirit of Christ. On the contrary, the word <i>law</i> that is added, means the same as though he called them meritorious; for what is referred to is the reward promised in the law.   			  <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ix-p16"></a>What, James says, that man is not justified by faith alone, but also by works, does not at all militate against the preceding view. The reconciling of the two views depends chiefly on the drift of the argument pursued by James. For the question with him is not, how men attain righteousness before God, but how they prove to others that they are justified, for his object was to confute hypocrites, who vainly boasted that they had faith. Gross 			 then is the sophistry, not to admit that the word, to justify, is taken in a different sense by James, from that in which it is used by Paul; for they handle different subjects. The word, faith, is also no doubt capable of various meanings. These two things must be taken to the account, before a correct judgment can be formed on the point. We may learn from the context, that James meant no more than that man is not made or proved to be just by a feigned or dead faith, and that he must prove his 			 righteousness by his works.

As he had put all mankind on a level, and brought them to the same condition, if there be any difference between them, it is from God, not from themselves, who have all things alike: but if it be true that God designs to make all the nations of the earth partakers of his mercy, then salvation, and 			 righteousness, which is necessary for salvation, must be extended to all. Hence under the name, <i>God,</i> is conveyed an intimation of a mutual relationship, which is often mentioned in Scripture, —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.x-p9"></a>“I shall be to you a God, and you shall be to me a people.” (<a name="vii.x-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022">Jer 30:22</a><a name="vii.x-p9.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.x-p10"></a>For the circumstance, that God, for a time, chose for himself a peculiar people, did not make void the origin of mankind, who were all formed after the image of God, and were to be brought up in the world in the hope of a blessed eternity.</p>

  			  <i>etc.</i> In saying that some are justified by faith, and some through faith, he seems to have indulged himself in varying his language, while he expresses the same thing, and for this end, — that he might, by the way, touch on the folly of the Jews, who imagined a difference between themselves and the Gentiles, though on the subject of justification there was no difference whatever; for since men became partakers of this 			 grace by faith only, and since faith in all is the same, it is absurd to make a distinction in what is so much alike. I am hence led to think that there is something ironical in the words, as though be said, — “If any wishes to have a difference made between the Gentile and the Jew, let him take this, — that the one obtains righteousness <i>by</i> faith, and the other<i> through</i> faith.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.x-p14"></a>But it may be, that some will prefer this distinction, — that the Jews were justified by faith, because they were born the heirs of grace, as the right of adoption was transmitted to them from the Fathers, — and that the Gentiles were justified through faith, because the covenant to them was adventitious.</p>  <a name="vii.xi"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.xi-p6"></a><b>31.</b> <i>Do we then make,</i> <i>etc.</i> When the law is opposed to faith, the flesh immediately suspects that there is some contrariety, as though the one were adverse to the other: and this false notion prevails, especially among those who are imbued with wrong ideas as to the 			 law, and leaving the promises, seek nothing else through it but the righteousness of works. And on this account, not only Paul, but our Lord himself, was evil spoken of by the Jews, as though in all his preaching he aimed at the abrogation of the law. Hence it was that he made this protest, —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.xi-p7"></a>“I came not to undo, but to fulfill the law.” (<a name="vii.xi-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017">Mt 5:17</a><a name="vii.xi-p7.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.xi-p8"></a>And this suspicion regards the moral as well as the ceremonial law; for as the gospel has put an end to the Mosaic ceremonies, it is supposed to have a tendency to destroy the whole dispensation of Moses. And further, as it sweeps away all the righteousness of works, it is believed to be opposed to all those testimonies of the law, by which the Lord has declared, that he has thereby prescribed the way of righteousness and salvation. I 			 therefore take this defense of Paul, not only as to ceremonies, nor as to the commandments which are called moral, but with regard to the whole law universally.  			  <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">128</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.xi-p10"></a>For the <i>moral </i>law is in reality confirmed and established through faith in Christ, inasmuch as it was given for this end — to lead man to Christ by showing him his iniquity; and without this it cannot be fulfilled, and in vain will it require what ought to be done; nor can it do anything but irritate lust more and more, and thus finally increase man’s condemnation; but where there is a coming to Christ, there is first found in him the 			 perfect righteousness of the law, which becomes ours by imputation, and then there is sanctification, by which our hearts are prepared to keep the law; it is indeed imperfectly done, but there is an aiming at the work. Similar is the case with<i> ceremonies,</i> which indeed cease and vanish away when Christ comes, but they are in reality confirmed by him; for when they are viewed in themselves they are vain and shadowy images, and then only do they attain anything real and solid, when their 			 end is regarded. In this then consists their chief confirmation, when they have obtained their accomplishment in Christ. Let us then also bear in mind, so to dispense the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be confirmed; but let it be sustained by no other strength than that of faith in Christ.</p>

 </p><p class="Super"><a name="vii.ii-p16"></a> Whenever there is a material agreement between the Greek and the Hebrew, we ought not to make it otherwise. If the verb κρίνεσθαι, as admitted by most critics, may be taken actively and be thus made to agree with the Hebrew, what reason can there be to take it in another sense? The only real difference is in one word, between νικήσης, “overcomest,” and <a name="vii.ii-p16.1"></a>תזכה, “art clear:” but the meaning is the same, though the words are different. To overcome in judgment, and to be clear in judgment, amounts to the same thing. The parallelism of the Hebrew requires κρίνεσθαι to be a verb in the middle voice, and to have an active meaning. The two lines in Hebrew, as it is 				  often the case in Hebrew poetry, contain the same sentiment in different words, the last line expressing it more definitely; so that to be “justified,” and to be “cleared,” convey the same idea; and also “in thy word,” or saying — <a name="vii.ii-p16.2"></a>בדברך and “in thy judgment” <a name="vii.ii-p16.3"></a>בשפטך. In <i>many</i> copies both these last words are in the plural number, so that the first would be strictly what is here expressed, “in thy words,” that is, the words which thou hast declared; and “in thy judgments,” that is, those which thou hast announced, would be fully rendered by “when thou Judgest.”</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.ii-p17"></a>Commentators, both ancient and modern, have differed on the meaning of the verb in question. <a name="vii.ii-p17.1"></a>Pareus<i>, </i><a name="vii.ii-p17.2"></a>Beza<i>, </i><a name="vii.ii-p17.3"></a>Macknight<i>,</i> and <a name="vii.ii-p17.4"></a>Stuart<i>,</i> take it in an active sense; 				  while <a name="vii.ii-p17.5"></a>Erasmus<i>, </i><a name="vii.ii-p17.6"></a>Grotius<i>, </i><a name="vii.ii-p17.7"></a>Venema<i>,</i> and others, contend for the passive meaning. <a name="vii.ii-p17.8"></a>Drusius<i>, </i><a name="vii.ii-p17.9"></a>Hammond<i>,</i> and <a name="vii.ii-p17.10"></a>Doddridge 				  render it, “when thou contendest in judgment,” or, “when thou art called to judgment:” and such a meaning no doubt the verb has according to <a name="vii.ii-p17.11"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040">Mt 5:40</a><a name="vii.ii-p17.11"></a>, and <a name="vii.ii-p17.12"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001">1 Cor. 6:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006">6</a><a name="vii.ii-p17.12"></a>. But in this case regard must be had, especially to the meaning 				  which corresponds the nearest with the original Hebrew. Some have maintained that “in thy judgment” <a name="vii.ii-p17.13"></a>בשפטך may be rendered “in judging thee;” but this would not only be unusual and make the sentence hardly intelligible, but also destroy the evident parallelism of the two lines. The whole verse may be thus literally rendered from the Hebrew, —</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.ii-p18"></a>Against thee, against thee only have I sinned;<br> 				  And the evil before thine eyes have I done;<br> 				  So that thou art justified in thy words,<br> 				  <i>And</i> clear in thy judgments.</p>

 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.ii-p21"></a><b>3. </b>For my transgression I acknowledge, And my sin is before me continually, —</p>

 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.v-p45"></a>There is a difference of opinion as to the precise object of the Apostle; whether in these quotations he had regard to the Jews only, or to both Jews and Gentiles.

 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.v-p46"></a>The most consistent view seems to be, that the passages quoted refer both to Jews and Gentiles; the last, more especially, to the Jews, while some of the preceding have a special reference to the Gentile world, particularly <a name="vii.v-p46.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#000">Ps 14</a><a name="vii.v-p46.1"></a>, as it describes the character of the enemies of God and his people, to whose liberation the Psalmist refers in the last verse. — 				  <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Super"><a name="vii.vi-p10"></a> To see the force and meaning of this verse, we must bear in mind that the former part was said to prevent the Jews from evading the application of the preceding testimonies; and then the words “that every mouth,” etc., and “that all the world,” etc., were added, not so much to include the Gentiles, as to include the Jews, who thought themselves exempted.

 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.vi-p14"></a>To disprove this notion it is sufficient to notice the sins which the Apostle had referred to; they are not those against the ceremonial but the moral law, and it is because the moral law is transgressed that it cannot justify.</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.vi-p15"></a>“If there be any law which man has perfectly kept, he may doubtless be justified by it; and surely no man can be justified by a law which condemns him for breaking it.

 </p><p class="Super"><a name="vii.vi-p16"></a> The argument and the reasoning of the Apostle seem to require that ἐξ ἔργων νόμου should be rendered here literally, “by works of law,” without the article, as the word “law” seems here, according to the drift of the argument, to mean law in general, both natural and revealed; and διὰ νόμου in the next clause must be regarded as 				  having the same meaning; the law of nature as well as the written law, though not to the same extent, makes sin known.

The verb προέθετο, <i>set forth,</i> it is added, seems to support the same view. To exhibit a <i>mercy-seat</i> is certainly not suitable language in this 				  connection.</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p17"></a><a name="vii.viii-p17.1"></a>Pareus renders it “<a name="vii.viii-p17.2"></a>placamentum — atonement,” <a name="vii.viii-p17.3"></a><i>hoc est</i><i>,</i> “<a name="vii.viii-p17.4"></a>placatorem,” that is, “atoner, or expiator.” <a name="vii.viii-p17.5"></a>Beza<i>’s </i>version is the same — “<a name="vii.viii-p17.6"></a>placamentum;” <a name="vii.viii-p17.7"></a>Doddridge has “propitiation,” and <a name="vii.viii-p17.8"></a>Macknight, “a propitiatory,” and <a name="vii.viii-p17.9"></a>Schleusner<i>,</i> “<a name="vii.viii-p17.10"></a>expiatorem — expiator.”</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p18"></a>The word occurs in one other place with the neuter article, τὸ ἱλαστήριον, <a name="vii.viii-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005">Heb 9:5</a><a name="vii.viii-p18.1"></a>, where it clearly means the mercy-seat.

 </p><p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p25"></a> The words are, διὰ τὴν πάρεσιν. They seem connected, not with the first clause, but with the one immediately preceding; and διὰ may be rendered here<i> in;</i> see a note on <a name="vii.viii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026">Ro 2:26</a><a name="vii.viii-p25.1"></a>; or more properly, perhaps, <i>on account of.</i> “For a proof of his own righteousness in passing by the sins,” etc., <a name="vii.viii-p25.2"></a>Macknight<i>;</i> “In order to declare his justification <i>with respect to</i> the remission of sins,” <a name="vii.viii-p25.3"></a>Stuart</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p26"></a>What is God’s “righteousness” here has been variously explained. Some regard it his righteousness in fulfilling his promises, as <a name="vii.viii-p26.1"></a>Beza<i>;</i> others, his righteousness in Christ to believers, mentioned in <a name="vii.viii-p26.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Ro 1:17</a><a name="vii.viii-p26.2"></a>, as <a name="vii.viii-p26.3"></a>Augustine<i>;</i> and others, his righteousness as the God of rectitude 				  and justice, as <a name="vii.viii-p26.4"></a>Chrysostom  Some, too, as <a name="vii.viii-p26.5"></a>Grotius<i>, </i>view it as meaning goodness or mercy, regarding the word as having sometimes this sense.</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p27"></a>It is the context that can help us to the right meaning. God exhibited his Son as a propitiation, to set forth this righteousness; and this righteousness is connected with the remission of, or rather; as the word means, the preterition of or connivance at sins committed under the old dispensation: and those sins were connived at through the forbearance of God, he not executing the punishment they deserved; and the purpose is 				  stated to be, — that God might be or appear <i>just,</i> while he is the justifier of those who believe in Christ. Now, what can this righteousness be but his administrative justice? As the law allowed no remission, and God did remit sins, there appeared to be a stain on divine justice. The exhibition of Christ as an atonement is what alone removes it. And there is a word in the former verse, as <a name="vii.viii-p27.1"></a>Venema justly observes, which tends to confirm this view, and that word is redemption, ἀπολυτρώσις, which is a deliverance obtained by a ransom, or by a price, such as justice requires.</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p28"></a>Both <a name="vii.viii-p28.1"></a>Doddridge and <a name="vii.viii-p28.2"></a>Scott regard the passage in this light; and the latter gives the following version of it, —</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p29"></a>“Whom God hath before appointed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his justice, on account of the passing by of sins, that had been committed in former times, through the forbearance of God; <i>I say,</i> for a demonstration of his justice, in this present time, in order that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.” — Nothing can be clearer than this version.</p>  				
 <p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p30"></a>The last words are rightly rendered, though not literally; τὸν ἐκ πίστεως Ιησου — “him of the faith of Jesus,” or, “him of faith in Jesus.” Him of faith is him who believes, as τοῖς οὑκ ἐκ περιτομὢς — “them not of circumcision” means “them who are not circumcised,” <a name="vii.viii-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012">Ro 4:12</a><a name="vii.viii-p30.1"></a>; and τοῖς έξ ἐριθείας — “those of contention,” signifies, “those who contend,” or, are contentious, <a name="vii.viii-p30.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008">Ro 2:8</a><a name="vii.viii-p30.2"></a>. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Super"><a name="vii.viii-p36"></a> There is a different preposition used here, πρὸς, while εἰς is found in the preceding verse. The meaning seems to be the same, for both prepositions are used to designate the design, end, or object of any thing. This variety seems to have been usual with the Apostle; similar instances are found in <a name="vii.viii-p36.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022">Ro 3:22</a><a name="vii.viii-p36.1"></a>, as to εἰς and ἐπὶ, and in <a name="vii.viii-p36.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030">Ro 3:30</a><a name="vii.viii-p36.2"></a>, as to ἐκ and διὰ. “By both,” says 				  <a name="vii.viii-p36.3"></a>Wolfius<i>,</i> “the final cause (<a name="vii.viii-p36.4"></a><i>causa finalis</i>) is indicated.” <a name="vii.viii-p36.5"></a>Beza renders them both by the same preposition, <a name="vii.viii-p36.6"></a><i>ad</i><i>, 				  </i>in Latin; and <a name="vii.viii-p36.7"></a>Stuart regards the two as equivalent. There is, perhaps, more refinement than truth in what <a name="vii.viii-p36.8"></a>Pareus says, — that εἰς intimates the proximate end — the forgiveness of sins; and πρὸς, the final end — the glory of God in 				  the exhibition of his justice as well as of his mercy. There is, at the same time, something in the passage which seems favorable to this view. Two objects are stated at the end of the passage, — that God might appear just, and be also the justifier of such as believe. The last may refer to ἐις, and the former to πρὸς; and this is consistent with the usual style of the Apostle; for, in imitation 				  of the Prophets, where two things are mentioned in a former clause, the order is reversed in the second. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

The same truth is implied in other parts of 				  Scripture, but not so expressly declared. <a name="vii.viii-p38.3"></a>Stuart makes here an important remark — that if the death of Christ be regarded only as that of a martyr or as an example of constancy, how then could its efficacy be referred to “sins that are past?” In no other way than as a vicarious death could it possibly have any effect on past sins, not punished through God’s forbearance. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

Besides, such an interpretation obliterates an important doctrine, that faith does not render void, or nullify the authority, the use and sanctions of the moral law but on the contrary, sustains and confirms them. Though it does what the law does not, and cannot do, inasmuch as it saves the sinner whom the law condemns; it yet effects this without relaxing or dishonoring the law, but in a way 				  that renders it, if possible, more binding, and more honorable, and more illustrious. It only renders the passage more intricate to include the ceremonial law, (for that has more of faith than of law in it,) to which no reference is made in the context: but there seems to be no objection to include the law of conscience, as well as the written law; for faith confirms both, and the word “law,” is here without the article, though this indeed of itself is not decisive. The moral law, then, as well 				  as the law of conscience, is what is here intended: for the authority of both is confirmed and strengthened by faith. — <i>Ed.</i></p>
