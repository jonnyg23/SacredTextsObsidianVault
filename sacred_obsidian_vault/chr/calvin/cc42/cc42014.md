 <p><a name="v.v.i-p12"></a><b>1. </b><i>Masters, what is just</i>. He mentions first, <i>what is just</i>, by which term he expresses that kindness, as to which he has given injunction in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (<a name="v.v.i-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008">Eph 6:8</a><a name="v.v.i-p12.1"></a>.) But as masters, looking down as it were from aloft, despise the condition of servants, so that they think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them under control,   		 <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">462</font></a>
  		 because both are equally under subjection to the authority of God. Hence that <i>equity</i> of which he makes mention.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p14"></a><i>And mutual equity.</i> Some understand it otherwise, but I have no doubt that Paul here employed <a name="v.v.i-p14.1"></a>ἰσότητα to mean analogical   		 <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">463</font></a>
  		 or distributive right,   		 <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">464</font></a>
  		 as in <i>Ephesians</i>, <a name="v.v.i-p16.2"></a>τὰ αὐτὰ, (<i>the</i> <i>same</i> <i>things</i>.)   		 <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">465</font></a>
  		 For masters have not their servants bound to them in such a manner as not to owe something to them in their turn, as analogical right to be in force among all ranks.   		 <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">466</font></a>

 <p><a name="v.v.i-p20"></a><b>2. </b><i>Continue in prayer</i>. He returns to general exhortations, in which we must not expect an exact order, for in that case he would have begun with prayer, but Paul had not an eye to that. Farther, as to prayer, he commends here two things; <i>first</i>, assiduity; <i>secondly</i>, alacrity, or earnest intentness. For, when he says, <i>continue</i>, he exhorts to perseverance, while he makes mention of <i>watching</i> in opposition to coldness, and listlessness.   		 <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">467</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p22"></a>He adds, <i>thanksgiving</i>, because God must be solicited for present necessity in such a way that, in the mean time, we do not forget favors already received. Farther, we ought not to be so importunate as to murmur, and feel offended if God does not immediately gratify our wishes, but must receive contentedly whatever he gives. Thus a 		twofold <i>giving of thanks</i> is necessary. As to this point something has also been said in the Epistle to the Philippians. (<a name="v.v.i-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">Php 4:6</a><a name="v.v.i-p22.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.i-p23"></a><a name="v.v.i-p23.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p24"></a><b>3. </b><i>Pray also for us</i>. He does not say this by way of pretense, but because, being conscious to himself of his own necessity, he was earnestly desirous to be aided by their prayers, and was fully persuaded that they would be of advantage to them. Who then, in the present day, would dare to despise the intercessions of brethren, which 		Paul openly declares himself to stand in need of? And, unquestionably, it is not in vain that the Lord has appointed this exercise of love between us — that we pray for each other. Not only, therefore, ought each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also, on our part, diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as often as occasion requires. It is, however, a childish   		 <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">468</font></a>
  		 argument on the part of Papists, who infer from this, that the dead must be implored   		 <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">469</font></a>
  		 to pray for us. For what is there here that bears any resemblance to this? Paul commends himself to the prayers of the brethren, with whom he knows that he has mutual fellowship according to the commandment of God: who will deny that this reason does not hold in the case of the dead? Leaving, therefore, such trifles, let us return to Paul.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p27"></a>As we have a signal example of modesty, in the circumstance that Paul calls others to his assistance, so we are also admonished, that it is a thing that is replete with the greatest difficulty, to persevere steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and especially when danger presses. For it is not without cause that he desires that the Churches may assist him in this matter. Consider, too, at the same time, his amazing ardor of zeal. He is 		not solicitous as to his own safety;   		 <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">470</font></a>
  		he does not ask that prayers may be poured forth by the Churches on his behalf, that he may be delivered from danger of death. He is contented with this one thing, that he may, unconquered and undaunted, persevere in a confession of the gospel; nay more, he fearlessly makes his own life a secondary matter, as compared with the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p29"></a>By a <i>door of utterance</i>, however, he simply means what, in <a name="v.v.i-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019">Eph 6:19</a><a name="v.v.i-p29.1"></a>, he terms the <i>opening of the mouth</i>, and what Christ calls a <i>mouth</i> <i>and</i> <i>wisdom</i>. (<a name="v.v.i-p29.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015">Lu 21:15</a><a name="v.v.i-p29.2"></a>.) For the expression differs nothing from the other in meaning, but merely in form, for he here intimates, by all elegant metaphor, that it is in no degree easier for us to speak confidently respecting the gospel, than to break through a door that is 		barred and bolted. For this is truly a divine work, as Christ himself said,</p>  	 
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v.i-p30"></a>It is not ye that speak, <br> 		but the Spirit of your Father <br> 		that speaketh in you. <br> 		(<a name="v.v.i-p30.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020">Mt 10:20</a><a name="v.v.i-p30.4"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p31"></a>Having, therefore, set forward the difficulty, he stirs up the Colossians the more to prayer, by declaring that he cannot speak right, except in so far as his tongue is directed by the Lord. <i>Secondly</i>, he argues from the dignity   		 <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">471</font></a>
  		 of the matter, when he calls the gospel the <i>mystery of Christ</i>. For we must labor in a more perfunctory manner in a matter of such importance. <i>Thirdly</i>, he makes mention also of his danger.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.i-p33"></a><a name="v.v.i-p33.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.i-p34"></a><b>4. </b><i>As I ought</i>. This clause sets forth more strongly the difficulty, for he intimates that it is no ordinary matter. In the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<a name="v.v.i-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020">Eph 6:20</a><a name="v.v.i-p34.1"></a>,) he adds, <a name="v.v.i-p34.2"></a>ἵνα παῤῥησιάσωμαι, (<i>that</i> <i>I</i> <i>may</i> <i>speak</i> <i>boldly</i>,) from which it appears that he desired for himself an undaunted confidence, such as befits the majesty of the gospel. Farther, as Paul here does nothing 		else than desire that grace may be given him for the discharge of his office, let us bear in mind that a rule is in like manner prescribed to us, not to give way to the fury of our adversaries, but to strive even to death in the publication of the gospel. As this, however, is beyond our power, it is necessary that we should <i>continue in prayer</i>, that the Lord may not leave us destitute of the spirit of confidence.</p>  <a name="v.v.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p14"></a><b>5. </b><i>Walk wisely.</i> He makes mention of <i>those that are without</i>, in contrast with those that are of the <i>household</i> <i>of</i> <i>faith</i>. (<a name="v.v.ii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Ga 6:10</a><a name="v.v.ii-p14.1"></a>.) For the Church is like a city of which all believers are the inhabitants, connected with each other by a mutual relationship, while unbelievers are strangers. But why would he have regard to be had to them, rather than to believers? There are three reasons: <i>first</i>,</p>  	 
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v.ii-p15"></a>lest any <i>stumblingblock</i> <i>be</i> <i>put</i> <i>in</i>,<br> 		<i>the</i> <i>way</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>blind</i>, (<a name="v.v.ii-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014">Le 19:14</a><a name="v.v.ii-p15.2"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p16"></a>for nothing is more ready to occur, than that unbelievers are driven from bad to worse through our imprudence, and their minds are wounded, so that they hold religion more and more in abhorrence. <i>Secondly</i>, it is lest any occasion may be given for detracting from the honor of the gospel, and thus the name of Christ be exposed to derision, persons be rendered more hostile, and disturbances and persecutions be stirred up. <i>Lastly</i>, 		it is, lest, while we are mingled together, in partaking of food, and on other occasions, we be defiled by their pollutions, and by little and little become profane.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p17"></a>To the same effect, also, is what follows, <i>redeeming the time</i>, that is, because intercourse with them is dangerous. For in <a name="v.v.ii-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016">Eph 5:16</a><a name="v.v.ii-p17.1"></a>, he assigns the reason, <i>because</i> 		<i>the</i> <i>days</i> <i>are</i> <i>evil</i>. “Amidst so great a corruption as prevails in the world we must seize opportunities of doing good, and we must struggle against impediments.” The more, therefore, that our path is blocked up with occasions of offense, so much the more carefully must we take heed lest our feet 		should stumble, or we should stop short through indolence.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.ii-p18"></a><a name="v.v.ii-p18.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p19"></a><b>6. </b><i>Your speech</i>. He requires suavity of speech, such as may allure the hearers by its profitableness, for he does not merely condemn communications that are openly wicked or impious, but also such as are worthless and idle. Hence he would have them <i>seasoned with 		salt</i>. Profane men have their seasonings of discourse,   		 <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">472</font></a>
  		 but he does not speak of them; nay more, as witticisms are insinuating, and for the most part procure favor,   		 <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">473</font></a>
  		 he indirectly prohibits believers from the practice and familiar use of them. For he reckons as tasteless everything that does not edify. The term <i>grace</i> is employed in the same sense, so as to be opposed to talkativeness, taunts, and all sorts of trifles which are either injurious or vain.   		 <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">474</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p23"></a><i>That ye may know how.</i> The man who has accustomed himself to caution in his communications will not fall into many absurdities, into which talkative and prating persons fall into from time to time, but, by constant practice, will acquire for himself expertness in making proper and suitable replies; as, on the other hand, it must necessarily happen, that silly 		talkers expose themselves to derision whenever they are interrogated as to anything; and in this they pay the just punishment of their silly talkativeness. Nor does he merely say <i>what</i>, but also <i>how</i>, and not to all indiscriminately, but to <i>every</i> <i>one</i>. For this is not the least important part of 		prudence — to have due regard to individuals.   		 <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">475</font></a>

 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p26"></a><b>7</b> <i>My things. </i>That the Colossians may know what concern he has for them, he confirms them, by giving them, in a manner, a pledge. For although he was in prison, and was in danger of his life, making care for himself a secondary matter, he consults for their interests by sending Tychicus to them. In this the 		singular zeal, no less than prudence of the holy Apostle, shines forth; for it is no small matter that, while he is held prisoner, and is in the most imminent danger on account of the gospel, he, nevertheless, does not cease to employ himself in advancing the gospel, and takes care of all the Churches. Thus, the body, indeed, is under confinement, but the mind, anxious to employ itself in everything good, roams far and wide. His prudence shews itself in his sending a fit and prudent person to 		confirm them, as far as was necessary, and withstand the craftiness of the false apostles; and, farther, in his retaining Epaphras beside himself, until they should come to learn what and how great an agreement there was in doctrine among all true teachers, and might hear from Tychicus the same thing that they had previously learned from Epaphras. Let us carefully meditate on these examples, that they may stir us up to all imitation of the like pursuit.</p>

 <p><a name="v.v.ii-p28"></a>He adds, <i>Onesimus</i>, that the embassy may have the more weight. It is, however, uncertain who this Onesimus was. For it can scarcely be believed that this is the slave of Philemon, inasmuch as the name of a thief and a fugitive would have been liable to reproach.   		 <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">476</font></a>
  		 He distinguishes both of them by honorable titles, that they may do the more good, and especially Tychicus, who was to exercise the office of an instructor.</p>  <a name="v.v.iii"></a>

  		 after he was brought to Rome. It is also probable that his enemies exerted themselves, in the outset, to deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening them with the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect; but that afterwards some, gathering up courage, despised everything that was held out to them in the way of terror.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="v.v.iii-p14"></a><i>That ye receive him.</i> Some manuscripts have <i>receive</i> in the imperative mood; but it is a mistake, for he expresses the nature of the <i>charge</i> which the Colossians had received — that it was a commendation of either Barnabas, or of Marcus.

  		 but it may be rendered in the way I have done. Let us, however, observe, that they were careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false brethren — from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants. The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors.</p>

 <p><a name="v.v.iii-p17"></a><b>11. </b><i>These only are fellow-workers,</i> — that is, of the circumcision; for he afterwards names others, but they were of the uncircumcision. He means, therefore, that there were few Jews at Rome who shewed themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay more, that the whole nation was opposed to Christ. At the same time, by <i>workers</i> he means those only who were endowed with gifts that were necessary for promoting the gospel. But where was Peter at that time? Unquestionably, he has either been shamefully passed over here, and not without injustice, or else those speak falsely who maintain that he was then at Rome. Farther, he calls the gospel the <i>kingdom of God</i>, for it is the scepter by 		which God reigns over us, and by means of it we are singled out to life eternal.   		 <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">479</font></a>

 <p><a name="v.v.iii-p20"></a><b>12</b> <i>Always striving.</i> Here we have an example of a good pastor, whom distance of place cannot induce to forget the Church, so as to prevent him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea. We must notice, also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word <i>striving</i>. For although the Apostle had it in view here to express intensity of affection, he at the same time admonishes the Colossians not to look upon the prayers of their pastor as useless, but, on the contrary, to reckon that they would afford them no small assistance. Lastly, let us infer from Paul’s words, that the <i>perfection</i> of 		Christians is, when they <i>stand complete in the will of God</i>, that they may not suspend their scheme of life upon anything else.</p>  <a name="v.v.iv"></a>

He would, undoubtedly, have called him his fellow-helper, or at least his companion 		and participant in his conflicts. I rather conjecture that he was absent at that time, and that it is another of the same name that is called a <i>physician,</i> to distinguish him from the other. <i>Demas</i>, of whom he makes mention, is undoubtedly the person of whom he complains — that he afterwards deserted him.

  		Let every one, therefore, know that this charge is laid upon him — that he is to train up his house in the fear of the Lord, to keep it under a holy discipline, and, in fine, to form in it the likeness of a Church.</p>

 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p21"></a><b>16.</b><i> Let it be read in the Church of the Laodiceans.</i> Hence, though it was addressed to the Colossians, it was, nevertheless, necessary that it should be profitable to others. The same view must also be taken of all the Epistles. They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine 		that is always in force, and is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title they bear, for the subject matter belongs to us. It has been groundlessly supposed that the other Epistle of which he makes mention was written by Paul, and those labor under a double mistake who think that it was written by Paul to the Laodiceans. I have no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns have usually 		many things in common. There was, however, an exceedingly gross imposture in the circumstance that some worthless person, I know not who, had the audacity to forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that is so insipid,   		 <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">481</font></a>
  		 that nothing can be conceived to be more foreign to Paul’s spirit.</p>

 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p24"></a><b>17</b> <i>Say to Archippus.</i> So far as I can conjecture, this Archippus was, in the mean time, discharging the office of pastor, during the absence of Epaphras; but perhaps he was not of such a disposition as to be sufficiently diligent of himself without being stirred up. Paul, accordingly, would have him be more 		fully encouraged by the exhortation of the whole Church. He might have admonished him in his own name individually; but he gives this charge to the Colossians that they may know that they must themselves employ incitements,   		 <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">482</font></a>
  		 if they see their pastor cold, and the pastor himself does not refuse to be admonished by the Church. For the ministers of the word are endowed with signal authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from laws. Hence, it is necessary that they should shew themselves teachable if they would duly teach others. As to Paul’s calling attention again   		 <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">483</font></a>
  		 to his <i>bonds</i>, he intimates by this that he was in no slight degree afflicted. For he was mindful of human infirmity, and without doubt he felt some twinges of it in himself, inasmuch as he was so very urgent that all pious persons, should be mindful of his distresses. It is, however, no evidence of distrust, that he calls in from all quarters the helps that were appointed 		him by the Lord. The subscription, <i>with his own hand</i>, means, as we have seen elsewhere, that there were even then spurious epistles in circulation, so that it was necessary to provide against imposition.   		 <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">484</font></a>
