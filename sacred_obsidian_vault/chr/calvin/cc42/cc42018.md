 <p><a name="vi.iii.i-p6"></a>The brevity of the inscription clearly shews that Paul’s doctrine had been received with reverence among the Thessalonians, and that without controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he deserved. For when in other Epistles he designates himself an Apostle, he does this for the purpose of 		claiming for himself authority. Hence the circumstance, that he simply makes use of his own name without any title of honor, is an evidence that those to whom he writes voluntarily acknowledged him to be such as he was. The ministers of Satan, it is true, had endeavored to trouble this Church also, but it is evident that their machinations were fruitless. He associates, however, two others along with himself, as being, in common with himself, the authors of the Epistle. Nothing farther is 		stated here that has not been explained elsewhere, excepting that he says, “the Church <i>in God the Father, and in Christ</i>;” by which terms (if I mistake not) he intimates, that there is truly among the Thessalonians a Church of God. This mark, therefore, is as it were an approval of a true and lawful Church. We may, however, at the same time infer from it, that a Church is to be sought for only where God 		presides, and where Christ reigns, and that, in short, there is no Church but what is founded upon God, is gathered under the auspices of Christ, and is united in his name.</p>  <a name="vi.iii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p15"></a><b>2</b> <i>We give thanks to God</i>. He praises, as he is wont, their faith and other virtues, not so much, however, for the purpose of praising them, as to exhort them to perseverance. For it is no small excitement to eagerness of pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with signal endowments, that he 		may finish what he has begun, and that we have, under his guidance and direction, advanced in the right course, in order that we may reach the goal. For as a vain confidence in those virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to themselves, puffs them up with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for the time to come, so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and stirs them up to anxious concern. Hence, instead of congratulations, he makes use of <i>thanksgivings</i>, that he may put them in mind, that everything in them that he declares to be worthy of praise, is a kindness from God.   		 <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">491</font></a>
  		 He also turns immediately to the future, in making mention of his <i>prayers</i>. We thus see for what purpose he commends their previous life.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.ii-p17"></a><a name="vi.iii.ii-p17.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p18"></a><b>3</b> <i>Unceasingly remembering you</i>. While the adverb <i>unceasingly</i> might be taken in connection with what goes before, it suits better to connect it in this manner. What follows might also be rendered in this way: <i>Remembering your work 		of faith and labor of love, etc.</i> Nor is it any objection to this that there is an article interposed between the pronoun <a name="vi.iii.ii-p18.1"></a>ὑμῶν and the noun <a name="vi.iii.ii-p18.2"></a>ἔργου,   		 <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">492</font></a>
  		 for this manner of expression is frequently made use of by Paul. I state this, lest any one should charge the old translator with ignorance, from his rendering it in this manner.   		 <a name="fr_492"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">493</font></a>
  		 As, however, it matters little as to the main point   		 <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">494</font></a>
  		 which you may choose, I have retained the rendering of Erasmus.   		 <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">495</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p23"></a>He assigns a reason, however, why he cherishes so strong an affection towards them, and prays diligently in their behalf — because he perceived in them those gifts of God which should stir him up to cherish towards them love and respect. And, unquestionably, the more that any one excels in piety and other excellences, so much the more ought we to hold him in regard and esteem. For what is more worthy of love than God? Hence there is 		nothing that should tend more to excite our love to individuals, than when the Lord manifests himself in them by the gifts of his Spirit. This is the highest commendation of all among the pious — this the most sacred bond of connection, by which they are more especially bound to each other. I have said, accordingly, that it is of little importance, whether you render it <i>mindful of your faith</i>, or <i>mindful of you on account of your faith</i>.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p24"></a><i>Work of faith </i>I understand as meaning the <i>effect</i> of it. This effect, however, may be explained in two ways — <i>passively</i> or <i>actively</i>, either as meaning that faith was in itself a signal token of the power 		and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he has wrought powerfully in the exciting of it, or as meaning that it afterwards produced outwardly its fruits. I reckon the effect to be in the root of faith rather than in its fruits — “A rare energy of faith has strewn itself powerfully in you.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p25"></a>He adds <i>labor of love</i>, by which he means that in the cultivation of love they had grudged no trouble or labor. And, assuredly, it is known by experience, how laborious love is. That age, however, more especially afforded to believers a manifold sphere of labor, if they were desirous to discharge the offices of love. The Church 		was marvelously pressed down by a great multitude of afflictions:   		 <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">496</font></a>
  		 many were stripped of their wealth, many were fugitives from their country, many were thrown destitute of counsel, many were tender and weak.   		 <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">497</font></a>
  		 The condition of almost all was involved. So many cases of distress did not allow <i>love</i> to be inactive.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p28"></a>To <i>hope</i> he assigns <i>patience</i>, as it is always conjoined with it, for <i>what we hope for, we in patience wait for</i>, (<a name="vi.iii.ii-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Ro 8:24</a><a name="vi.iii.ii-p28.1"></a>) and the statement should be explained to mean, that Paul remembers their patience in hoping for the coming of Christ. From this we may gather a brief definition of true Christianity — that it is a faith that is lively and full of vigor, so that it spares no labor, when assistance is to be given to one’s neighbors, but, on the contrary, all the pious employ themselves diligently in offices of love, and lay out their efforts in them, 		so that, intent upon the hope of the manifestation of Christ, they despise everything else, and, armed with patience, they rise superior to the wearisomeness of length of time, as well as to all the temptations of the world.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p29"></a>The clause, <i>before our God and Father</i>, may be viewed as referring to Paul’s remembrance, or to the three things spoken immediately before. I explain it in this way. As he had spoken of his <i>prayers</i>, he declares that as often as he raises his thoughts to the kingdom of God, he, at 		the same time, recalls to his remembrance the <i>faith, hope</i>, and <i>patience</i>, of the Thessalonians, but as all mere presence must vanish when persons come into the presence of God, this is added,   		 <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">498</font></a>
  		 in order that the affirmation may have more weight. Farther, by this declaration of his goodwill towards them he designed to make them more teachable and prepared to listen.   		 <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">499</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.ii-p32"></a><a name="vi.iii.ii-p32.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p33"></a><b>4</b> <i>Knowing, brethren beloved</i>. The participle <i>knowing</i> may apply to Paul as well as to the Thessalonians. Erasmus refers it to the Thessalonians. I prefer to follow Chrysostom, who understands it of Paul and his colleagues, for it is (as it appears to me) 		a more ample confirmation of the foregoing statement. For it tended in no small degree to recommend them — that God himself had testified by many tokens, that they were acceptable and dear to him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p34"></a><i>Election of God</i>. I am not altogether dissatisfied with the interpretation given by Chrysostom — that God had made the Thessalonians illustrious, and had established their excellence. Paul, however, had it in view to express something farther; for he touches upon their calling, and as there had appeared in it no common marks of God’s power, he infers 		from this that they had been specially called with evidences of a sure <i>election</i>. For the reason is immediately added — that it was not a bare preaching that had been brought to them, but such as was conjoined with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that it might obtain entire credit among them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p35"></a>When he says, <i>in power, and in the Holy Spirit</i>, it is, in my opinion, as if he had said — in the power <i>of</i> the Holy Spirit, so that the latter term is added as explanatory of the former. <i>Assurance</i>, to which he assigned the third 		place, was either in the thing itself, or in the disposition of the Thessalonians. I am rather inclined to think that the meaning is, that Paul’s gospel had been confirmed by solid proofs,   		 <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">500</font></a>
  		 as though God had shewn from heaven that he had ratified their calling.   		 <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">501</font></a>
  		 When, however, Paul brings forward the proofs by which he had felt assured that the calling of the Thessalonians was altogether from God, he takes occasion at the same time to recommend his ministry, that they may themselves, also, recognize him and his colleagues as having been raised up by God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p38"></a>By the term <i>power</i> some understand miracles. I extend it farther, as referring to spiritual energy of doctrine. For, as we had occasion to see in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul places it in contrast with <i>speech</i>   		 <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">502</font></a>
  		 — the voice of God, as it were, living and conjoined with effect, as opposed to an empty and dead eloquence of men. It is to be observed, however, that the election of God, which is in itself hid, is manifested by its marks—when he gathers to himself the lost sheep and joins them to his flock, and holds out his hand to those that were wandering and estranged from him. Hence a knowledge of our election must be sought from this source. As, 		however, the secret counsel of God is a labyrinth to those who disregard his calling, so those act perversely who, under pretext of <i>faith</i> and <i>calling</i>, darken this first grace, from which faith itself flows. “By faith,” say they, “we obtain salvation: there is, therefore, no eternal predestination of God that distinguishes between us and reprobates.” It is as though they said — “Salvation is of 		faith: there is, therefore, no grace of God that illuminates us in faith.” Nay rather, as gratuitous election must be conjoined with calling, as with its effect, so it must necessarily, in the mean time, hold the first place. It matters little as to the sense, whether you connect <a name="vi.iii.ii-p39.2"></a>ὑπὸ with the participle <i>beloved</i> or with the term <i>election</i>    		 <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">503</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.ii-p41"></a><a name="vi.iii.ii-p41.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p42"></a><b>5</b> <i>As ye know</i>. Paul, as I have said before, has it as his aim, that the Thessalonians, influenced by the same considerations, may entertain no doubt that they were elected by God. For it had been the design of God, in honoring Paul’s ministry, that he might manifest to them their adoption. Accordingly, 		having said that they <i>know what manner of persons they had been</i>,   		 <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">504</font></a>
  		 he immediately adds that he was such<i> for their sake</i>, by which he means that all this had been given them, in order that they might be fully persuaded that they were loved by God, and that their election was beyond all controversy.</p>  <a name="vi.iii.iii"></a>  	  		 		     		  
 <p class="TableCaption16"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p1"></a><a name="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006">1 Thessalonians 1:6-8</a><a name="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></a></p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p2"></a><b>6</b>. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p4"></a><b>7</b>. So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p5"></a><b>7</b>. Ita ut fueritis exemplaria omnibus credentibus in Macedonia et in Achaia.</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p6"></a><b>8</b>. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p7"></a><b>8</b>. A vobis enim personuit sermo Domini: nec in Macedonia tantum et in Achaia, sed etiam in omni loco, fides vestra quae in Deum est manavit: ita ut non opus habeamus quicquam loqui.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p10"></a><b>6</b> <i>And ye became imitators</i>. With the view of increasing their alacrity, he declares that there is a mutual agreement, and harmony, as it were, between his preaching and their faith. For unless men, on their part, answer to God, no proficiency will follow from the grace that is offered to them — not as 		though they could do this of themselves, but inasmuch as God, as he begins our salvation by calling us, perfects it also by fashioning our hearts to obedience. The sum, therefore, is this — that an evidence of Divine election shewed itself not only in Paul’s ministry, in so far as it was furnished with the power of the Holy Spirit, but also in the faith of the Thessalonians, so that this conformity is a powerful attestation of it. He says, however, “Ye were imitators <i>of God and of us</i>,” in the same sense in which it is said, that <i>the people believed God and his servant Moses</i>, (<a name="vi.iii.iii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013">Ex 14:13</a><a name="vi.iii.iii-p10.1"></a>   		 <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">505</font></a>
  		) not as though Paul and Moses had anything different from God, but because he wrought powerfully by them, as his ministers and instruments.   		 <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">506</font></a>
  		 <i>While ye embraced.</i> Their readiness in receiving the gospel is called an <i>imitation</i> of God, for this reason, that as God had presented himself to the Thessalonians in a liberal spirit, so they had, on their part, voluntarily come forward to meet him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p13"></a>He says, <i>with the joy of the Holy Spirit</i>, that we may know that it is not by the instigation of the flesh, or by the promptings of their own nature, that men will be ready and eager to obey God, but that this is the work of God’s Spirit. The circumstance, that <i>amidst 		much tribulation</i> they had embraced the gospel, serves by way of amplification. For we see very many, not otherwise disinclined to the gospel, who, nevertheless, avoid it, from being intimidated through fear of the cross. Those, accordingly, who do not hesitate with intrepidity to embrace along with the gospel the afflictions that threaten them, furnish in this an admirable example of magnanimity. And from this it is so much the more 		clearly apparent, how necessary it is that the Spirit should aid us in this. For the gospel cannot be properly, or sincerely received, unless it be with a joyful heart. Nothing, however, is more at variance with our natural disposition, than to rejoice in afflictions.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p14"></a><a name="vi.iii.iii-p14.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii-p15"></a><b>7</b> <i> So that ye were</i>. Here we have another amplification — that they had stirred up even believers by their example; for it is a great thing to get so decidedly the start of those who had entered upon the course before us, as to furnish assistance to them for prosecuting their course. <i>Typus</i> (the word made use of by Paul) is employed by the Greeks in the same sense as <a name="vi.iii.iii-p15.1"></a><i>Exemplar</i> is among the Latins, and <a name="vi.iii.iii-p15.2"></a><i>Patron</i> among the French. He says, then, that the courage of the Thessalonians had been so illustrious, that other believers had borrowed from them a rule of constancy. I preferred, however, to render it <i>patterns</i>, that I might not needlessly make any change 		upon the Greek phrase made use of by Paul; and farther, because the plural number expresses, in my opinion, something more than if he had said that that Church as a body had been set forward for imitation, for the meaning is, that there were as many <i>patterns</i> as there were individuals.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p16"></a><a name="vi.iii.iii-p16.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p class="Super"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p17"></a><b>8</b> <i>For from you sounded forth</i>. Here we have an elegant metaphor, by which he intimates that their faith was so lively,   		 <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">507</font></a>
  		 that it did, as it were, by its <i>sound</i>, arouse other nations. For he says that the word of God <i>sounded forth </i>from them, inasmuch as their faith was <i>sonorous</i>   		 <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">508</font></a>
  		 for procuring credit for the gospel. He says that this had not only occurred in neighboring places, but this <i>sound</i> had also extended far and wide, and had been distinctly heard, so that the matter did not require to be published by him.   		 <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">509</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p8"></a>He says that the report of their conversion had obtained great renown everywhere. What he mentions as to his <i>entering in among them</i>, refers to that power of the Spirit, by which God had signalized his gospel.   		 <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">510</font></a>
  		 He says, however, that both things are freely reported among other nations, as things worthy of being made mention of. In the detail which follows, he shews, first, what the condition of mankind is, before the Lord enlightens them by the doctrine of his gospel; and farther, for what end he would have us instructed, and what is the fruit of the gospel. For although all do not worship idols, all are nevertheless addicted to idolatry, and are immersed in blindness 		and madness. Hence, it is owing to the kindness of God, that we are exempted from the impostures of the devil, and every kind of superstition. Some, indeed, he converts earlier, others later, but as alienation is common to all, it is necessary that we be converted to God, before we can serve God. From this, also, we gather the essence and nature of true faith, inasmuch as no one gives due credit to God but the man, who renouncing the vanity of his own understanding, embraces and receives the 		pure worship of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p10"></a><b>9</b> <i>To the living God</i>. This is the end of genuine conversion. We see, indeed, that many leave off superstitions, who, nevertheless, after taking this step, are so far from making progress in piety, that they fall into what is worse. For having thrown off all regard to God, they give themselves up to a 		profane and brutal contempt.   		 <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">511</font></a>
  		 Thus, in ancient times, the superstitions of the vulgar were derided by Epicurus, Diogenes the Cynic, and the like, but in such a way that they mixed up the worship of God so as to make no difference between it and absurd trifles. Hence we must take care, lest the pulling down of errors be followed by the overthrow of the building of faith. Farther, the Apostle, in ascribing to God the epithets <i>true and living</i>, 		indirectly censures idols as being dead and worthless inventions, and as being falsely called gods. He makes the end of conversion to be what I have noticed — that they might <i>serve God</i>. Hence the doctrine of the gospel tends to this, that it may induce us to serve and obey God. For so long as we are the <i>servants of sin</i>, we are <i>free from righteousness</i>, (<a name="vi.iii.iv-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020">Ro 6:20</a><a name="vi.iii.iv-p11.2"></a>) inasmuch as we sport ourselves, and wander up and down, exempt from any yoke. No one, therefore, is properly converted to God, but the man who has learned to place himself wholly under subjection to him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p12"></a>As, however, it is a thing that is more than simply difficult, in so great a corruption of our nature, he shews at the same time, what it is that retains and confirms us in the fear of God and obedience to him — <i>waiting for Christ.</i> For unless we are stirred up to the hope of eternal life, the world will quickly draw us to 		itself. For as it is only confidence in the Divine goodness that induces us to serve God, so it is only the expectation of final redemption that keeps us from giving way.   		 <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">512</font></a>
  		 Let every one, therefore, that would persevere in a course of holy life, apply his whole mind to a expectation of Christ’s coming. It is also worthy of notice, that he uses the expression <i>waiting for Christ</i>, instead of the hope of everlasting salvation. For, unquestionably, without Christ we are ruined and thrown into despair, but when Christ shews himself, life and 		prosperity do at the same time shine forth upon us.   		 <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_512"><font size="1">513</font></a>
  		 Let us bear in mind, however, that this is said to believers exclusively, for as for the wicked, as he will come to be their Judge, so they can do nothing but tremble in looking for him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p15"></a>This is what he afterwards subjoins — that Christ <i>delivereth us from the wrath to come</i>. For this is felt by none but those who, being reconciled to God by faith, have conscience already pacified; otherwise,   		 <a name="fr_513"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">514</font></a>
  		 his name is dreadful. Christ, it is true, delivered us by his death from the anger of God, but the import of that deliverance will become apparent on the last day.   		 <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">515</font></a>
  		 This statement, however, consists of two departments. The <i>first</i> is, that the wrath of God and everlasting destruction are impending over the human race, inasmuch as <i>all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</i>. (<a name="vi.iii.iv-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023">Ro 3:23</a><a name="vi.iii.iv-p17.2"></a>) The <i>second</i> is, that there is no way of escape but through the grace of Christ; for it is not without good grounds that Paul assigns to him this office. It is, however, an inestimable gift, that the pious, whenever mention is made of judgment, know that Christ will come as a Redeemer to them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p18"></a>In addition to this, he says emphatically, <i>the wrath to come</i>, that he may rouse up pious minds, lest they should fail from looking at the present life. For as faith is a <i>looking at things that do not appear</i>, (<a name="vi.iii.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001">Heb 11:1</a><a name="vi.iii.iv-p18.1"></a>) nothing is less befitting than that we should estimate the wrath of God, according as any one is afflicted in the world; as nothing is more absurd than to take hold of the transient blessings which we enjoy, that we may from them form an estimate of God’s favor. While, therefore, on the one hand, the wicked sport themselves at their ease, and we, on the other hand, languish in misery, let us learn to fear the vengeance of God, 		which is hid from the eyes of flesh, and take our satisfaction in the secret delights of the spiritual life.   		 <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">516</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iii.iv-p20"></a><a name="vi.iii.iv-p20.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iv-p21"></a><b>10</b> <i>Whom he raised up</i>. He makes mention here of Christ’s resurrection, on which the hope of our resurrection is founded, for death everywhere besets us. Hence, unless we learn to look to Christ, our minds will give way at every turn. By the same consideration, he admonishes them that Christ is to be 		<i>waited for from heaven</i>, because we will find nothing in the world to bear us up,   		 <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">517</font></a>
  		 while there are innumerable trials to overwhelm us. Another circumstance must be noticed;   		 <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">518</font></a>
  		 for as Christ rose for this end — that he might make us all at length, as being his members, partakers of the same glory with himself, Paul intimates that his resurrection would be vain, unless he again appeared as their Redeemer, and extended to the whole body of the Church the fruit and effect of that power which he manifested in himself.   		 <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">519</font></a>
