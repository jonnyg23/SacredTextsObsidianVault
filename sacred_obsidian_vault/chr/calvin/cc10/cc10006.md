 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN17"><a name="vii-p1"></a>PSALM 72</p>  		
 <p><a name="vii-p2"></a>David in this psalm prays to God, in the name of the whole Church, for the continual prosperity of the kingdom which was promised him, and teaches us at the same time, that the true happiness of the godly consists in their being placed under the government of a king who was raised to the throne by the appointment of heaven.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent28"><a name="vii-p3"></a>¶ Of Solomon.   		   <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">119</font></a>
 </p>  		
 <p><a name="vii-p5"></a>From the inscription of this psalm we cannot determine who was its author. As it is expressly said at the close to be the last of David’s prayers, it is more probable that it was composed by him than by Solomon, his successor.   		   <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">120</font></a>
  		   It may, however, be conjectured that Solomon reduced the prayer of his father into poetical measure, to make it more generally known, and to bring it more extensively into use among the people, — a conjecture which is not improbable. But as the letter <a name="vii-p6.2"></a>ל, <i>lamed, </i>has many significations in Hebrew, it may be explained as 		  denoting that this psalm was composed for or in behalf of Solomon. If this is admitted, it is to be observed, that under the person of one man there is comprehended the state of the kingdom through successive ages. After having carefully weighed the whole matter, I am disposed to acquiesce in the conjecture, that the prayers to which David gave utterance on his death-bed were reduced by his son into the form of a psalm, with the view of their being kept in everlasting remembrance. To indicate 		  the great importance of this prayer, and to induce the faithful with the greater earnestness to unite their prayers with the memorable prayer of this holy king, it is expressly added, that this is the last which he poured forth. As Solomon did nothing more than throw into the style of poetry the matter to which his father gave expression, David is to be considered as the principal author of this inspired composition. Those who would interpret it simply as a prophecy of the kingdom of Christ, 		  seem to put a construction upon the words which does violence to them; and then we must always beware of giving the Jews occasion of making an outcry, as if it were our purpose, sophistically, to apply to Christ those things which do not directly refer to him. But as David, who was anointed king by the commandment of God, knew that the terms upon which he and his posterity possessed the kingdom were, that the power and dominion should at length come to Christ; and as he farther knew that the 		  temporal well-being of the people was, for the time, comprehended in this kingdom, as held by him and his posterity, and that from it, which was only a type or shadow, there should at length proceed something far superior — that is, spiritual and everlasting felicity; knowing, as he did, all this, he justly made the perpetual duration of this kingdom the object of his most intense solicitude, and prayed with the deepest earnestness in its behalf, — reiterating his prayer in his last moments, 		  with the view of distinctly testifying, that of all his cares this was the greatest. What is here spoken of everlasting dominion cannot be limited to one man, or to a few, nor even to twenty ages; but there is pointed out the succession which had its end and its complete accomplishment in Christ.</p>  <a name="vii.i"></a>

  			  While David, to whom the promise had been made, at his death affectionately recommended to God his son, who was to succeed him in his kingdom, he doubtless endited to the Church a common form of prayer, that the faithful, convinced of the impossibility of being prosperous and happy, except under one head, should show all respect, and yield all obedience to this legitimate order of things, and also that from this typical kingdom they might be 			 conducted to Christ. In short, this is a prayer that God would furnish the king whom he had chosen with the spirit of uprightness and wisdom. By the terms <i>righteousness and judgment, </i>the Psalmist means a due and well-regulated administration of government, which he opposes to the tyrannical and unbridled license of heathen kings, who, despising God, rule according to the dictates of their own will; and thus the holy king of Israel, who was 			 anointed to his office by divine appointment, is distinguished from other earthly kings. From the words we learn by the way, that no government in the world can be rightly managed but under the conduct of God, and by the guidance of the Holy Spirit. If kings possessed in themselves resources sufficiently ample, it would have been to no purpose for David to have sought by prayer from another, that with which they were of themselves already provided. But in requesting that the righteousness and 			 judgment of God may be given to kings, he reminds them that none are fit for occupying that exalted station, except in so far as they are formed for it by the hand of God. Accordingly, in the Proverbs of Solomon, (<a name="vii.i-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015">Pr 8:15</a><a name="vii.i-p9.3"></a>,) Wisdom proclaims that kings reign by her. Nor is this to be wondered at, when we consider that civil government is so excellent an institution, that God would 			 have us to acknowledge him as its author, and claims to himself the whole praise of it. But it is proper for us to descend from the general to the particular; for since it is the peculiar work of God to set up and to maintain a rightful government in the world, it was much more necessary for him to communicate the special grace of his Spirit for the maintenance and preservation of that sacred kingdom which he had chosen in preference to all others. By <i>the king’s son 			 </i>David no doubt means his successors. At the same time, he has an eye to this promise:</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.i-p10"></a>“Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne,” <br> 			 (<a name="vii.i-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011">Ps 132:11</a><a name="vii.i-p10.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p11"></a>But no such stability as is indicated in that passage is to be found in the successors of David, till we come to Christ. We know that after the death of Solomon, the dignity of the kingdom decayed, and from that time its wealth became impaired, until, by the carrying of the people into captivity, and the ignominious death inflicted upon their king, the kingdom was involved in total ruin. And even after their return from Babylon, their 			 restoration was not such as to inspire them with any great hope, until at length Christ sprung forth from the withered stock of Jesse. He therefore holds the first rank among the children of David.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p12"></a><a name="vii.i-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p13"></a><b>2.</b> <i>He shall judge thy people in righteousness.</i> Some read this in the form of a wish — <i>O</i> <i>that he may judge, etc. </i>Others retain the future tense; and thus it is a prophecy. But we will come 			 nearer the correct interpretation by understanding something intermediate, as implied. All that is afterwards spoken, concerning the king, flows from the supposition, that the blessing prayed for in the first verse is conferred upon him — from the supposition that he is adorned with righteousness and judgment. The prayer, then, should be explained thus: Govern our king, O God! that he may judge. Or in this way, When thou shalt have bestowed upon the king thy righteousness, then he will judge 			 uprightly. To govern a nation well, is an endowment far too excellent to grow out of the earth; but the spiritual government of Christ, by which all things are restored to perfect order, ought much more to be considered a gift of heaven. In the first clause of the verse, David speaks of the whole people in general. In the second clause, he expressly mentions <i>the poor, </i>who, on account of their poverty and weakness, have need of the help of 			 others, and for whose sake kings are armed with the sword to grant them redress when unjustly oppressed. Hence, also, proceeds <i>peace, </i>of which mention is made in the third verse. The term <i>peace </i>being employed among the Hebrews to denote not only <i>rest </i>and <i>tranquillity, </i>but also <i>prosperity, </i>David teaches us that the people would enjoy prosperity and happiness, when the affairs of the nation were administered according to the principles of righteousness. <i>The bringing forth of peace</i> is a figurative expression taken from the fertility of the earth.   			  <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a>
  			  And when it is said that <i>the mountains and hills shall bring forth peace,</i>   			  <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">126</font></a>
  			 the meaning is, that no corner would be found in the country in which it did not prevail, not even the most unpromising parts, indicated by the mountains, which are commonly barren, or at least do not produce so great an abundance of fruits as the valleys. Besides, both the word <i>peace </i>and the word <i>righteousness </i>are connected with each clause of the verse, and must be 			 twice repeated,   			  <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">127</font></a>
  			  the idea intended to be conveyed being, that peace by righteousness   			  <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">128</font></a>
  			  should be diffused through every part of the world. Some read simply <i>righteousness, </i>instead of In <i>righteousness, </i>supposing the letter <a name="vii.i-p17.1"></a>ב<i>, beth, </i>to be here redundant, which does not, however, appear to be the 			 case.   			  <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">129</font></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p19"></a><a name="vii.i-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p20"></a><b>4.</b><i> He shall judge the poor of the people.</i> The poet continues his description of the end and fruit of a righteous government, and unfolds at greater length what he had briefly touched upon concerning the afflicted among the people. But it is a truth which ought to be borne in mind, that kings can keep themselves 			 within the bounds of justice and equity only by the grace of God; for when they are not governed by the Spirit of righteousness proceeding from heaven, their government is converted into a system of tyranny and robbery. As God had promised to extend his care to the poor and afflicted among his people, David, as an argument to enforce the prayer which he presents in behalf of the king, shows that the granting of it will tend to the comfort of the poor. God is indeed no respecter of persons; but 			 it is not without cause that God takes a more special care of the poor than of others, since they are most exposed to injuries and violence. Let laws and the administration of justice be taken away, and the consequence will be, that the more powerful a man is, he will be the more able to oppress his poor brethren. David, therefore, particularly mentions that the king will be the defender of those who can only be safe under the protection of the magistrate, and declares that he will be their 			 avenger when they are made the victims of injustice and wrong. The phrase, <i>The children of the afflicted, </i>is put for <i>the afflicted, </i>an idiom quite common in Hebrew, and a similar form of expression is sometimes used by the Greeks, as when they say <a name="vii.i-p20.1"></a>υἱους 			 ἰατρων, <i>the sons of physicians, </i>for <i>physicians.</i>   			  <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">130</font></a>
  			  But as the king cannot discharge the duty of succouring and defending the poor which David imposes upon him, unless he curb the wicked by authority and the power of the sword, it is very justly added in the end of the verse, that when righteousness reigns, <i>oppressors </i>or <i>extortioners will be broken in pieces. </i>It would be foolish to wait till 			 they should give place of their own accord. They must be repressed by the sword, that their audacity and wickedness may be prevented from proceeding to greater lengths. It is therefore requisite for a king to be a man of wisdom, and resolutely prepared effectually to restrain the violent and injurious, that the rights of the meek and orderly may be preserved unimpaired. Thus none will be fit for governing a people but he who has learned to be rigorous when the case requires. Licentiousness must 			 necessarily prevail under an effeminate and inactive sovereign, or even under one who is of a disposition too gentle and forbearing. There is much truth in the old saying, that it is worse to live under a prince through whose lenity everything is lawful, than under a tyrant where there is no liberty at all.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p22"></a><a name="vii.i-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.i-p23"></a><b>5.</b><i> They shall fear thee with the sun</i> If this is read as an apostrophe, or change of person, it may be properly and without violence understood of the king; implying, that the ornaments or distinctions which chiefly secure to a sovereign reverence from his subjects are his impartially securing to every man the 			 possession of his own rights, and his manifesting a spirit of humanity ready at all times to succor the poor and miserable, as well as a spirit determined rigorously to subdue the audacity of the wicked. But it will be more appropriate, without changing the person, to explain it of God himself.   			  <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">131</font></a>
  			  The preservation of mutual equity among men is an inestimable blessing; but the service of God is well worthy of being preferred even to this. David, therefore, very properly commends to us the blessed fruits of a holy and righteous government, by telling us that it will draw in its train true religion and the fear of God. And Paul, when enjoining us in <a name="vii.i-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002">1Ti 2:2</a><a name="vii.i-p24.1"></a>, to pray for kings, expressly mentions what we ought to have in view in our prayers, which is, “that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.” As there is no small danger, were civil government overthrown, of religion being destroyed, and the worship of God annihilated, David beseeches God to have respect to his own name and glory in preserving the king. By this argument he at once reminds kings of their duty, and stirs up the people 			 to prayer; for we cannot be better employed than in directing all our desires and prayers to the advancement of the service and honor of God. When we come to Christ, this is far more truly applicable to him, true religion being established in his kingdom and nowhere else. And certainly David, in describing the worship or service of God as continuing to the end of the world, intimates by the way that he ascends in thought to that everlasting kingdom which God had promised: <i>They shall fear thee with the sun; and generation of generations shall fear thee in the presence of the moon.</i>   			  <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">132</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.i-p27"></a><b>6.</b> <i>He shall descend as the rain upon the mown grass.</i> This comparison may seem at first sight to be somewhat harsh; but it elegantly and appositely expresses the great advantage which is derived by all from the good and equitable constitution of a kingdom. Meadows, we know, are cut in the 			 beginning of summer when the heat prevails; and did not the earth imbibe new moisture by the falling rain, even the very roots of the herbage would wither by reason of the barren and parched state of the soil. David, therefore, teaches us that as God defends the earth from the heat of the sun by watering it, so he in like manner provides for the welfare of his Church, and defends it under the government of the king. But this prediction has received its highest fulfillment in Christ, who, by 			 distilling upon the Church his secret grace, renders her fruitful.</p>  <a name="vii.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption20"><a name="vii.ii-p1"></a><a name="vii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007">Psalm 72:7-11</a><a name="vii.ii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="vii.ii-p6"></a><b>7.</b><i> In his days shall the righteous flourish</i> It is unnecessary for me frequently to repeat what I have once stated, that all these sentences depend upon the first verse. David, therefore, prayed that the king might be adorned with righteousness and judgment, that the just might flourish and the people prosper. 			 This prediction receives its highest fulfillment in Christ. It was, indeed, the duty of Solomon to maintain the righteous; but it is the proper office of Christ to make men righteous. He not only gives to every man his own, but also reforms their hearts through the agency of his Spirit. By this means he brings righteousness back, as it were, from exile, which otherwise would be altogether banished from the world. Upon the return of righteousness there succeeds the blessing of God, by which he 			 causes all his children to rejoice in the way of making them to perceive that under their King, Christ, every provision is made for their enjoying all manner of prosperity and felicity. If any would rather take the word <i>peace </i>in its proper and more restricted signification, I have no objections to it. And, certainly, to the consummation of a happy life, nothing is more desirable than peace; for amidst the turmoils and contentions of war, men 			 derive almost no good from having an abundance of all things, as it is then wasted and destroyed. Moreover, when David represents the life of the king as prolonged to the end of the world, this shows more clearly that he not only comprehends his successors who occupied an earthly throne, but that he ascends even to Christ, who, by rising from the dead, obtained for himself celestial life and glory, that he might govern his Church for ever.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p7"></a><a name="vii.ii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p8"></a><b>8</b>  <i>He shall have dominion from sea to sea.</i> As the Lord, when he promised his people the land of Canaan for an inheritance, assigned to it these four boundaries, (<a name="vii.ii-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018">Ge 15:18</a><a name="vii.ii-p8.1"></a>,) David intimates, that so long as the kingdom shall continue to exist, the possession of the promised land will be entire, to teach the faithful that the blessing of God cannot be fully realised, except whilst this kingdom shall flourish. He therefore declares that he will exercise dominion from the Red Sea, or from that arm of the Egyptian sea to the sea of Syria, which is called the Sea of the Philistines,   			  <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">134</font></a>
  			  and also from the river Euphrates to the great wilderness. If it is objected that such narrow bounds do not correspond with the kingdom of Christ, which was to be extended from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, we reply, that David obviously accommodates his language to his own time, the amplitude of the kingdom of Christ not having been, as yet, fully unfolded. He has therefore begun his description in phraseology well known, and in familiar use 			 under the law and the prophets; and even Christ himself commenced his reign within the limits here marked out before he penetrated to the uttermost boundaries of the earth; as it is said in <a name="vii.ii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Ps 110:2</a><a name="vii.ii-p9.1"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.ii-p10"></a>“The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p11"></a>But, soon after, the Psalmist proceeds to speak of the enlarged extent of the empire of this king, declaring that the kings beyond the sea shall also be tributaries to him; and also that the inhabitants of the desert shall receive his yoke. The word <a name="vii.ii-p11.1"></a>ציים, <i>tsiim,</i>   			  <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">135</font></a>
  			  which we have translated <i>inhabitants of the desert,</i> is, I have no doubt, to be understood of those who, dwelling towards the south, were at a great distance from the land of Canaan. The Prophet immediately adds, that <i>the enemies of the king shall lick the dust </i>in token of their 			 reverence. This, as is well known, was in ancient times a customary ceremony among the nations of the East; and Alexander the Great, after he had conquered the East, wished to compel his subjects to practice it, from which arose great dissatisfaction and contentions, the Macedonians disdainfully refusing to yield such a slavish and degrading mark of subjection.   			  <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">136</font></a>
  			  The meaning then is, that the king chosen by God in Judea will obtain so complete a victory over all his enemies, far and wide, that they shall come humbly to pay him homage.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p14"></a><a name="vii.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.ii-p15"></a><b>10.</b> <i>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents.</i> The Psalmist still continues, as in the preceding verse, to speak of the extent of the kingdom. The Hebrews apply the appellation of <i>Tarshish </i>to the whole coast, which 			 looks towards Cilicia. By <i>the isles, </i>therefore, is denoted the whole coast of the Mediterranean Sea, from Cilicia to Greece. As the Jews, contenting themselves with the commodities of their own country, did not undertake voyages to distant countries, like other nations; God having expressly required them to confine themselves within the limits of their own country, that they might not be corrupted by the manners of strangers; they were 			 accustomed, in consequence of this, to apply the appellation of <i>isles </i>to those countries which were on the other side of the sea. I indeed admit that Cyprus, Crete, and other islands, are comprehended under this name; but I also maintain that it applies to all the territories which were situated beyond the Mediterranean Sea. By the words <a name="vii.ii-p15.1"></a>מנחה, <i>minchah, a present, </i>and <a name="vii.ii-p15.2"></a>אשכר, <i>eshcar, a gift, </i>must be understood any tribute or custom, and not voluntary offerings; for it is vanquished enemies, and the mark or token of their subjection, which are spoken of. These terms appear to be used intentionally in this place, in order 			 to mitigate the odium attached to such a mark of subjugation;   			  <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">137</font></a>
  			  as if the inspired writer indirectly reproved subjects, if they defrauded their kings of their revenues. By <a name="vii.ii-p16.4"></a>שבא, <i>Sheba, </i>some think Arabia is intended, and by <a name="vii.ii-p16.5"></a>שבא,<i> Seba, </i>Ethiopia. Some, however, by the first word understand all that part of the Gulf of Arabia which lies towards Africa; and by the second, which is written with the letter <a name="vii.ii-p16.6"></a>ס,<i> samech, </i>the country of Sabea,   			  <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">138</font></a>
  			  the more pleasant and fruitful country. This opinion is probably the more correct of the two. It is unnecessary here to remark how foolishly this passage has been wrested in the Church of Rome. They chant this verse as referring to the philosophers or wise men who came to worship Christ; as if, indeed, it were in their power of philosophers to make kings all upon a sudden; and in addition to this, to change the quarters of the world, to make of the east the south or 			 the west.</p>

 <p><a name="vii.ii-p19"></a><b>11.</b> <i>And all kings shall prostrate themselves before him.</i> This verse contains a more distinct statement of the truth, That the whole world will be brought in subjection to the authority of Christ. The kingdom of Judah was unquestionably never more flourishing than under the reign of 			 Solomon; but even then there were only a small number of kings who paid tribute to him, and what they paid was inconsiderable in amount; and, moreover, it was paid upon condition that they should be allowed to live in the enjoyment of liberty under their own laws. While David then began with his own son, and the posterity of his son, he rose by the Spirit of prophecy to the spiritual kingdom of Christ; a point worthy of our special notice, since it teaches us that we have not been called to the 			 hope of everlasting salvation by chance, but because our heavenly Father had already destined to give us to his Son. From this we also learn, that in the Church and flock of Christ there is a place for kings; whom David does not here disarm of their sword nor despoil of their crown, in order to admit them into the Church, but rather declares that they will come with all the dignity of their station to prostrate themselves at the feet of Christ.</p>  <a name="vii.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.iii-p5"></a><b>12.</b> <i>For he will deliver the poor when he crieth to him. </i>The Psalmist again affirms that the kingdom which he magnifies so greatly will not be tyrannical or cruel. The majority of kings, neglecting the well-being of the community, have their minds wholly engrossed with their own private interests. The 			 consequence is, that they unmercifully oppress their miserable subjects; and it even happens that the more formidable any of them is, and the more absorbing his rapacity, he is accounted so much the more eminent and illustrious. But it is far different with the king here described. It has been held as a proverb by all mankind, “That there is nothing in which men approach nearer to God than by their beneficence;” and it would be very inconsistent did not this virtue shine forth in those kings 			 whom God has more nearly linked to himself. Accordingly, David, to render the king beloved who was chosen of God, justly declares, not only that he will be the guardian of justice and equity, but also that he will be so humane and merciful, as to be ready to afford succor to the most despised; qualities too seldom to be found in sovereigns, who, dazzled with their own splendor, withdraw themselves to a distance from the poor and the afflicted, as if it were unworthy of, and far beneath, their 			 royal dignity to make them the objects of their care. David avows that the blood of the common people, which is usually accounted vile and as a thing of nought, will be very precious in the estimation of this heavenly king. Constancy and magnanimity are denoted by the words <i>he will redeem; </i>for it would be far short of the duty of a king merely to hate fraud and extortion, did he not resolutely come forward to punish these crimes and set himself 			 to defend those who are oppressed.   			  <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">139</font></a>
  			  Under the terms <i>fraud </i>and <i>violence </i>is comprehended all kind of wrong-doing; for a man in working mischief is either a lion or a fox. Some rage with open violence, and others proceed to wrong-doing insidiously and by secret arts. Moreover, we know that supreme sovereignty, both in heaven and earth, has been given to Christ, (<a name="vii.iii-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018">Mt 28:18</a><a name="vii.iii-p6.2"></a>,) that he may defend his people not only from all temporal dangers, but especially from all the harassing annoyances of Satan, until having delivered them at length from all trouble, he gather them into the everlasting rest of his heavenly kingdom.</p>

 <p><a name="vii.iii-p8"></a><b>15.</b><i> And he shall live.</i> To refer the word <i>live </i>to the poor, as some do, seems forced. What David affirms is, that this king shall be rewarded with long life, which is not the least of God’s earthly blessings. The words which follow are to be read indefinitely, 			 that is to say, without determining any particular person;   			  <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">140</font></a>
  			  as if it had been said, The gold of Arabia shall be given him, and prayers shall everywhere be made for his prosperity. There is thus again a repetition of what had been previously said concerning his power; for if Arabia shall pay him tribute, how vast an amount of riches will be gathered from so many countries nearer home! Christ, it is true, does not reign to hoard up gold, but David meant to teach by this figure, that even the nations which were most remote 			 would yield such homage to him, as to surrender to him themselves and all that they possessed. It is no uncommon thing for the glory of the spiritual kingdom of Christ to be portrayed under images of outward splendor. David, in conformity with this usual style of Scripture, has here foretold that the kingdom of Christ would be distinguished for its wealth; but this is to be understood as referring to its spiritual character. Whence it appears how wickedly and wantonly the Papists have perverted 			 this passage, and made it subserve their purpose of raking to themselves the perishable riches of the world. Moreover, when he speaks of the common prayers of the people, by which they will commend the prosperity of the king to the care of God, he intimates that so well-pleased will they be with being his subjects, that they will account nothing so desirable as to yield entire submission to his authority. Many, no doubt, reject his yoke, and hypocrites fret and murmur secretly in their hearts, 			 and would gladly extinguish all remembrance of Christ, were it in their power; but the affectionate interest here predicted is what all true believers are careful to cultivate, not only because to pray for earthly kings is a duty enjoined upon them in the Word of God, but also because they ought to feel a special desire and solicitude for the enlargement of the boundaries of this kingdom, in which both the majesty of God shines forth, and their own welfare and happiness are included. 			 Accordingly, in <a name="vii.iii-p9.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025">Ps 118:25</a><a name="vii.iii-p9.4"></a>, we will find a form of prayer dictated for the whole Church, That God would bless this king; not that Christ stands in need of our prayers, but because he justly requires from his servants this manifestation or proof of true piety; and by it they may also exercise themselves in praying for the coming of the kingdom of God.</p>  <a name="vii.iv"></a>

  			  for a small portion appears to be well founded. They think that by the two circumstances here referred to, a rare and uncommon fertility is indicated. Only a very small quantity of wheat, not even more than a man can hold in the palm of his hand, has been sown, and that even upon the tops of the mountains, which generally are far from being fruitful; and yet so very abundant will be the increase, that the ears will wave and rustle in the 			 winds as the trees on Lebanon. I do not, however, know whether so refined a comparison between seed-time and harvest is at all intended by David. His words may be considered more simply as denoting that so great will be the fertility, so abundant the produce of wheat which the mountain tops shall yield, that it may be reaped with full hand. By this figure is portrayed the large abundance of all good things which, through the blessing of God, would be enjoyed under the reign of Christ. To this 			 is added the increase of children. Not only would the earth produce an abundance all kinds of fruits, but the cities and towns also would be fruitful in the production of men: <i>And they shall go out </i>  			  <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">144</font></a>
  			 <i> from the city as the grass of the earth</i> I have preferred translating the word <i>Lebanon </i>in the genitive case instead of the nominative; for the metonomy of putting the name of the mountain, Lebanon, for the trees upon it, which is renounced by others, is somewhat harsh.</p>

 <p><a name="vii.iv-p11"></a><b>17.</b> <i>His name shall endure for ever</i> The inspired writer again repeats what he had previously affirmed concerning the perpetual duration of this kingdom. And he doubtless intended carefully to distinguish it from earthly kingdoms, which either suddenly vanish away, or at length, 			 oppressed with their own greatness, fall into ruin, affording by their destruction incontestible evidence that nothing in this world is stable and of long duration. When he says that <i>his name shall endure for ever,</i> it is not to be understood as merely implying that his fame should survive his death, as worldly men are ambitious that their name may not be buried with their body. He 			 is rather speaking of the kingdom when he says that the name of this prince will continue illustrious and glorious for ever. Some explain the words <a name="vii.iv-p11.1"></a>לפני-שמש, <i>liphney-shemesh,</i> which we have rendered, <i>in the presence of the sun</i>, as if he meant that the glory with which God would invest the kings of Judah would surpass the brightness of the sun; but this is at variance with the context, for he had said above, (verse 5th,) in the same sense, <i>with the sun, </i>and <i>in the presence of the moon.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.iv-p12"></a>After having, therefore, made mention of the everlasting duration of the name of this king, he subjoins, by way of explanation, <i>his name shall be continued in the presence of the sun</i> Literally it is, <i>his name shall have children,</i>   			  <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">145</font></a>
  			  (for the Hebrew verb is derived from the noun for <i>son</i>,) that is to say, it shall be perpetuated from father to son;   			  <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">146</font></a>
  			  and as the sun rises daily to enlighten the world, so shall the strength of this king be continually renewed, and thus will continue from age to age for ever. In like manner, we shall afterwards see that the sun and the moon are called witnesses of the same eternity, (<a name="vii.iv-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038">Ps 89:38</a><a name="vii.iv-p14.2"></a>.) Whence it follows that this cannot be understood of the earthly kingdom, 			 which flourished only for a short time in the house of David, and not only lost its vigor in the third successor, but was at length ignominiously extinguished. It properly applies to the kingdom of Christ; and although that kingdom often totters upon the earth when assailed with the furious hatred of the whole world, and battered by the most formidable engines of Satan, it is yet wonderfully upheld and sustained by God, that it may not altogether fail. The words which follow, <i>All nations</i> <i>shall bless themselves in him,</i> admit of a twofold meaning. The Hebrews often use this form of expression when the name of any man is used as an example or formula of prayer for blessings. For instance, a man blesses himself in David, who beseeches God to be as favorable and bountiful to him as he 			 proved himself to be towards David. On the other hand, he is said to curse in Sodom and Gomorrah who employs the names of these cities by which to pronounce some curse. If, then, these two expressions, <i>they shall bless themselves in him, and they shall call him blessed, </i>are used in the same sense; the expression, <i>to bless themselves in the king, 			 </i>will just mean to pray that the same prosperity may be conferred upon us which was conferred upon this highly favored king, whose happy condition will excite universal admiration. But if it is considered preferable to distinguish between these two expressions, (which is not less probable,) to <i>bless one’s self in the king, </i>will denote to seek happiness from him; for the nations will be convinced that nothing is more 			 desirable than to receive from him laws and ordinances.</p>

  			  David, after having prayed for prosperity to his successors, breaks forth in praising God, because he was assured by the divine oracle that his prayers would not be in vain. Had he not with the eyes of faith beheld those things which we have seen above, his rejoicing would have been less free and lively. When he says that <i>God alone doeth wonderful things, </i>this, no doubt, is spoken in reference to the subject of which he is presently treating, with the view not only of commending the excellence of the kingdom, but also to admonish himself and others of the need which there is that God should display his wonderful and stupendous power for its preservation. And certainly it was not owing to any of David’s successors, a few excepted, that the royal throne did not fall a hundred times, yea, was not even 			 completely ruined. To go no farther, was not Solomon’s most disgraceful apostasy deserving of utter destruction? And as to the rest of his successors, with the exception of Josias, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, and a few others, did they not fall from evil to worse, as if each strove to outstrip his predecessor, and thus so provoked the wrath of God, as it were deliberately, that it is wonderful that he did not immediately launch the thunderbolts of his vengeance upon the whole race utterly to destroy 			 them? Moreover, as David, being endued with the Spirit of prophecy, was not ignorant that Satan would always continue to be a cruel enemy of the Church’s welfare, he doubtless knew that the grace of God, of which he presently speaks, would have great and arduous difficulties to overcome in order to continue for ever in his own nation. And the event afterwards unquestionably showed by how many miracles God accomplished his promises, whether we consider the return of his people from the captivity 			 of Babylon, or the astonishing deliverances which followed until Christ as a tender branch sprung out of a dead tree. David, therefore, with good reason prays that the glory of the divine name may fill the whole earth, since that kingdom was to be extended even to the uttermost boundaries of the globe, And that all the godly, with earnest and ardent affection of heart, may unite with him in the same prayers, there is added a confirmation in the words, <i>Amen, and Amen</i></p>

 <p><a name="vii.iv-p19"></a><b>20.</b> <i>The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</i> We have before observed that this was not without cause added by Solomon, (if we may suppose him to have put the matter of this psalm into the form of poetical compositions) not only that he might avoid defrauding his father of the 			 praise which was due to him, but also to stir up the Church the more earnestly to pour forth before God the same prayers which David had continued to offer even with his last breath. Let us then remember that it is our bounden duty to pray to God, both with unfeigned earnestness, and with unwearied perseverance, that he would be pleased to maintain and defend the Church under the government of his Son. The name of <i>Jesse, </i>the father of David, 			 seems to be here introduced to bring to remembrance David’s origin, that the grace of God may appear the more illustrious in having raised from the sheepfold a man of mean birth, as well as the youngest and the least esteemed among his brethren, and in having advanced him to so high a degree of honor, as to make him king over the chosen people.</p>
