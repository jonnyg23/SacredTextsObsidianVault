 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p5"></a><a name="xix.i-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.i-p6"></a>He follows the same subject. During times of tranquillity, when nothing but joyful voices were heard among the Jews, he bewails, as one in the greatest grief, the miseries of the people; and being not satisfied with this, he says, <i>Who will set, </i>or make, <i>my head waters, and my eye a fountain of tears? </i>He intimates by these words, that the ruin would be so dreadful that it could not be bewailed by a moderate or usual lamentation, inasmuch as God’s vengeance would exceed common bounds, and fill men with more dread than other calamities.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.i-p7"></a>The meaning is, that the destruction of the people would be so monstrous that it could not be sufficiently bewailed. It hence appears how hardened the Jews had become; for doubtless the Prophet had no delight in such comparisons, as though he wished rhetorically to embellish his discourse; but as he saw that their hearts were inflexible, and that a common way of speaking would be despised, or would have no weight and authority, he was 			 constrained to use such similitudes. And at this day, there is no less insensibility in those who despise God; for however Prophets may thunder, while God spares and indulges them, they promise to themselves perpetual quietness. Hence it is, that they ridicule and insult both God and his servants, as though they were too harshly treated. As then, the same impiety prevails now in the world as formerly, we may hence learn what vehemence they ought to use whom God calls to the same office of 			 teaching. Plain teaching, then, will ever be deemed frigid in the world, except it, be accompanied with sharp goads, such as we find employed here by the Prophet 			  <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">235</font></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.ii-p5"></a><a name="xix.ii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p6"></a>Here the Prophet entertains another wish: He had before wished that his head were waters, that he might shed tears, and he had wished his eyes to be the fountains of tears; but now, after having duly considered the wickedness of the people, he puts off every feeling of humanity, and as one incensed, he desires to move elsewhere, and wholly to leave the people; for their impiety had so prevailed that he could no longer live among them. It is 			 indeed certain that the Prophet had no common grief, when he perceived that God’s dreadful vengeance was not far distant: it is also certain that he was moved and constrained by their detestable conduct to desire to be removed elsewhere. But he speaks not only for his own sake; for he regards his own nation, and expresses his feelings, that he might more effectually touch their hearts. We must then understand, that so great was the sympathy of the Prophet, that he was not satisfied with 			 shedding tears, but that he wished that his whole head would flow into fearn It appears, also, that he was so moved with idignation, that he wished wholly to leave his own people. But, as I have said, his object was to try whether he could restore them to the right way.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p7"></a>He then shews, in this verse, that the Jews had become so detestable, that all the true servants of God wished to be removed far away from them: <i>Who </i>then <i>will set me in the desert? </i>He seeks not for himself another country; he desires not to dwell in a pleasant situation, or that some commodious asylum should be offered to him? but he desires to be placed in the desert, or in the lodging of travelers. He speaks not of those 			 lodgings or inns, which were in villages and towns; but of a lodging in the desert; according to what is the case, when a long and tedious journey is made through forests, some sheds are formed, that when a traveler is over — taken by the darkness of night, he might be protected by some covering, and not He down in the open air. It is of this kind of lodging that the Prophet speaks: then he no doubt means a shed; but as to the word, we may retain, as I have said, its proper meaning. What 			 is meant is, that to dwell in the desert alllong wild beasts was better than to be among that abominable people. By expressing this wish he inflamed no doubt the fury of the whole people, or at least of most of them; but it was necessary thus forcibly to address them: as they submitted to no kind and wholesome warnings and counsels, they were to be forcibly stimulated and urged by such reproofs as these.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p8"></a><i>I will leave my people</i> This had an emphatic, bearing; for delightful to every one is his native soil, and it is also delightful to dwell among one’s own people. As then the Prophet wished to be removed into the desert,, and to leave his own people, all his relatives and the nation from which he sprang, and to depart frora them, it 			 follows that they nmst have come to extremities.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p9"></a>And the reason is added, <i>For all are adulterers</i> I take the word <a name="xix.ii-p9.1"></a>מנאפים <i>menaphim, </i>adulterers, in a metaphorical sense, as meaning all those who had departed 			 from God, and abandoned themselves to ungodly superstitions, or those who had become so vitiated and corrupt as to retain no integrity. He does not then call them adulterers, because they were given to whoredoms, but because they were immersed in all kinds of defilements. He afterwards calls them <i>an assembly of apostates, </i>or of perfidious men. The word <a name="xix.ii-p9.2"></a>עצר<i>, otsar, </i>means to prohibit, to restrain: hence the noun <a name="xix.ii-p9.3"></a>עצרת <i>ostaret, </i>means a summoned assembly, when, according to an oath or laws, men are forced to meet; and after the assembly is proclaimed, they dare not depart. Then the Prophet by this word points out the 			 consent and union that existed among that people, as though he had said, that they no less clave to their sins, that if by a solemn rite or authority or ordinance they had been summoned together and were prohibited to depart. We hence see that he condemns the impious consent that was among the people, and also their pertinacity; for they could by no means be restored to a right mind. And for this reason he calls them also <a name="xix.ii-p9.4"></a>בגדים <i>begadim, </i>transgressors; for by this word the Hebrews mean, not every kind of sinners, but those who are wholly wicked: and hence the prophets, when, they speak of apostates and revolters, ever call them <a name="xix.ii-p9.5"></a>בגדים, <i>begadim, 			 </i>as in this passage.  			  <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">236</font></a>

 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="xix.iii-p1"></a>PRAYER</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.iii-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast been pleased that the prophetic writings should be preserved for our use, that they may continually excite us to repentance, and that since thou stiffest up daily those who urge us by their exhortations, and draw us, as it were by force, to repent, — O grant, that there may not be in us such perverseness as we see existed in thine ancient people; but that we may render ourselves teachable, and be so moved by 			 thy threatenings, as to anticipate thy judgment, lest we, mistaking thy forbearance, should at length be visited with that dread, described to us by thy servant Jeremiah, but that we may, on the contrary, find thee to the end to be not only a reconcilable but also a most merciful Father, until we shall at last enjoy a fuller knowledge of thy goodness in thy celestial kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.v-p5"></a><a name="xix.v-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.v-p6"></a>Jeremiah confirms what he had said of the near destruction of the people; for, as we have said, the Jews ridiculed threatenings while they thought themselves far from every danger. But the Prophet shews, from the nature of God himself, that they must necessarily perish in a short time; for since God is the judge of the world, and as they were continually advancing in impiety and wickedness, they could no longer be tolerated. This is the 			 meaning.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.v-p7"></a>He first says, that they <i>stretched their tongues as a bow for falsehoods</i> The verb <a name="xix.v-p7.1"></a>דרך, <i>darek, </i>means to walk, and often occurs in this sense; but; it means also 			 to stretch, to bend, and is frequently applied to bows. As it is here in Hiphil, some take it in a transitive sense. It ought in this case to have <a name="xix.v-p7.2"></a>י<i>, iod; </i>but such defect is often found in other places. This sense is the most suitable; that is, that they shot with their tongues falsehood as with a bow. Others improperly construe <a name="xix.v-p7.3"></a>שקר, <i>shikor, </i>in the genitive case, as though he had said, “the bow of falsehood, but this gives no meaning; and therefore “the bow of falsehood” cannot be admitted here. The sense is, that they shot falsehood with their tongue as with a bow, or that they made their 			 tongue to go to falsehood, or that they stretched their tongue like a bow for falsehood. If the last rendering be approved, — that they stretched their tongue, etc., then the Prophet compares their tongues to bows and falsehoods to arrows. As to the subject itself, there is no difference, whether we read that they shot lies with their tongues, or that they stretched their tongues for lies: for 			 the Prophet simply means that their tongues, as he will hereafter tell us, were so pointed that they pierced one another with slanders and falsehoods, as though one stretched a bow and shot an arrow. He then intimates, that all their words were deadly, for they were intent on slanders and falsehoods, so that there was no intercourse without a mortal wound.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.v-p8"></a>He then adds, that they were <i>not strong for the truth</i> Some read, “They have been strong, but not for the truth;” others, “They have been strong as to the truth,” or for the truth: but I think that the Prophet’s meaning is different, — that having checked the truth, 			 they took more liberty for themselves, as though he had said that they triumphed when all faithfulness and rectitude were destroyed; for by the word, <a name="xix.v-p8.1"></a>אמונה<i> amune, </i>the Prophet no doubt means that fidelity by which men ought to carry on their concerns one with another. Since, then, there was no uprightness among them, he says, that they marched forth as victorious when 			 they trod under foot what was just and right. It is indeed a proof of extreme impiety, when men, trampling upon faithfulness and equity, allow themselves every kind of licentiousness. Some give this explanation, — that they ruled, not through their faithfulness or virtues, for they had crept into and obtained honors by wicked and deceitful arts. And it. is indeed certain that the Prophet directs his discourse, not against the common people, but against the chief men, who had attained their 			 power by frauds. But I am satisfied with the view that I have already given, — that they had become <i>strong </i>because there was no truth, as when we say that the blind rule in darkness, when everything is in confusion. The meaning is, that they were not only given up to their sins, but that they also triumphed over fidelity and justice, by allowing themselves every liberty, as there was no one who dared to say a word to restrain them. He says, that 			 they thus became strong through the <i>whole land; </i>for he sets forth here the deplorable state of the people in general; as though he had said, “There is no hope of deliverance left, for truth and faithfulness are everywhere oppressed.”  			  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">237</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.v-p12"></a>An explanation follows, — that they <i>proceeded from evil to evil; </i>that is, they obstinately went on in their evil doings; for to go forth means the same as to pass. They then <i>passed from evil to evil; </i>that is, when they had done one evil, no repentance entered their hearts, so as to turn back; but they continued their wickedness, and aceunrelated evils on evils. We now then understand what the Prophet means; for he sets forth their pertinacity in evil deeds, and at the same time shews that there was no evidence of amendment, for they passed from one bad deed to another like it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.v-p13"></a><i>And me have they not known, saith Jehovah</i> He shews here what is the source of all evils; they had cast aside every knowledge and every thought of God. We indeed know that when God is really known, his fear must necessarily influence our hearts; and the knowledge of God begets reverence and a regard for religion. It is indeed true, that 			 God is somewhat known by even the ungodly and the wicked, and that they have some notions respecting him; but it is no more than an empty knowledge. When indeed we are fully persuaded that God is the judge of the world, and when we have also a knowledge of his goodness and paternal favor, we necessarily fear him and spontaneously and willingly worship and serve him. Ignorance of God, then, is a kind of madness which carries men headlong to every sort of impiety. On this account, God complains 			 that he was not known by the people, for the fear of him was not in them. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.vi"></a>  		   			  				  				
 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.vi-p1"></a><a name="xix.vi-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004">Jeremiah 9:4</a><a name="xix.vi-p1.1"></a></p> 				 			  				  				
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p2"></a><b>4</b>. Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</p> 				  				
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p3"></a><b>4</b>. Et vir a socio suo cavete <i>(hoc est, </i>caveat; <i>ad verbum, </i>custodiat se; caveat <i>igitur </i>sibi quisque a socio,) et super omni fratre <i>(ad verbum) </i>ne confidatis <i>(hoc est, </i>nemo confidat proprio fratre;) quia omnis frater supplantando supplantat, et omnis socius fraudulenter incedit.</p> 				 			  		    		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.vi-p5"></a><a name="xix.vi-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p6"></a>In this verse the Prophet describes the extreme wickedness of the people. For though sometimes thefts, robberies, frauds, slaughters, perjuries, sorceries prevail, yet some regard for near relations remains; but it is monstrous when all relative affections are destroyed. As then, even in the most wicked, there remain some natural affections, called <i>storgoe </i>by philosophers, it follows, that men depart wholly from nature and become wild 			 beasts, when these no longer exist. This is the import of what is here said.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p7"></a>There is a similar passage in <a name="xix.vi-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005">Mic. 7:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006">6</a><a name="xix.vi-p7.1"></a>. The idea is there indeed more fully expanded; for the Prophet adds,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.vi-p8"></a>“From her who sleeps in thy bosom guard the doors of thy mouth; for the son lies in wait for his father, and the daughter delivers up her mother to death; and the chief enemies of man are his own domestics.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p9"></a>The prophets then mainly agree in shewing, that there was no humanity left among flmm; for the son, forgetful of his duty, rose up against his father, and every one was perfidious towards his own friend, and a brother spared not his own brother.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p10"></a><i>Let a man </i>then <i>guard himself</i> This is not an admonition, as though the Prophet exhorted men to be wary; but he only shews that there was no fidelity; for every one was perfidious and unfaithful towards his own friend, and even a brother acted 			 unjustly towards his own brother. It hence follows, that the Jews are charged with being natural monsters; for they were deservedly objects of detestation, when they cast aside every care for their own blood, and as far as they could, destroyed everything like humanity. He says that brothers by <i>supplanting supplanted, </i>that is, craftily deceived and circumvented their own brothers. The verb <a name="xix.vi-p10.1"></a> עקב<i>okob, </i>is to be taken mttaphorically; it is derived from the heel of the foot, and means to oppress the simple by secret arts. He says also, that all <i>friends acted fraudulently. </i>Of this kind of speaking we have spoken on <a name="xix.vi-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028">Jer 6:28</a><a name="xix.vi-p10.2"></a>; for 			 we found there the same complaint; and the Prophet then said the Jews were like iron and brass, because they had hardened themselves so as to be capable of any cruelty. This sort of speaking often occurs, when the word <a name="xix.vi-p10.4"></a>רכיל, <i>rekil, </i>is connected with the verb <a name="xix.vi-p10.5"></a>הלך <i>elak; </i>and they who are the most learned in the language say, that this word is never found in Scripture but in connection with the verb to go or to walk. They hence conclude that some particular person is meant, that is, one who goes about veiled or deceitfully, and rambles and runs here and there, that he may find some opportunity of deceiving and cheating. It cannot be 			 taken here for slandering, as we have also stated on chapter the sixth: it is too unmeaning. It is found indeed in this sense in <a name="xix.vi-p10.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016">Le 19:16</a><a name="xix.vi-p10.6"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.vi-p11"></a>“Go not about a slanderer among thy people;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vi-p12"></a>where some render it a whisperer. But the Prophet no doubt condemns here the frauds and deceitful crafts, by which they deceived and cheated one another: for <a name="xix.vi-p12.1"></a>רכל, <i>recal</i> signifies a merchant; and as it is often the 			 case that traders act cunningly and practice crafty artifices, the Hebrews call that man <a name="xix.vi-p12.2"></a>רכיל <i>racal, </i>fraudulent and wickedly crafty, whose object is to deceive and cheat. And we see that this is the meaning in this place, as it designates 			 those who circumvented one another: for the Prophet says, that they were foolish who trusted in brothers or friends; and he gives the reason, because brothers supplanted one another, and friends went about fraudulently. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.vii"></a>  		   			  				  				
 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.vii-p1"></a><a name="xix.vii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005">Jeremiah 9:5</a><a name="xix.vii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.vii-p5"></a><a name="xix.vii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p6"></a>Jeremiah goes on with the same subject. He says that fidelity had so disappeared among the Jews, that every one endeavored to deceive his neighbor. Hence it followed, that they were withhout any shame. Some sense of shame at least remains among men, when they have to do with their own friends; for though they may be wholly given to gain, and to indulge in falsehoods, yet when they transact business with friends, they retain some regard for 			 equity, and shame checks their wickedness: but when there is no difference made between friends and strangers, it follows that their character is become altogether brutal. This is what the Prophet meant.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p7"></a>And he adds, that they <i>spoke not the truth</i> He now says that they were liars, not in this or that particular business; but that they were perfidious and deceitful in everything. This clause then is not to be limited to some special acts of fraud; but it is the same as though he had said, that they knew not what 			 truth was, or what it was to act with good faith and to speak honestly to their neighhours; for they were wholly imbued with deceits, and no truth could come out of their mouth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p8"></a>And for the same purpose he says, that they had <i>taught their tongues to speak falsehood.</i> The expression in this clause is stronger; for he means that they were wholly given to deceit, as by long use they had formed their tongues for this work. The tongue ought to be the representative of the mind, according to 			 the old saying; for why was the tongue formed, but in order that men may communicate with one another? For the thoughts are hidden, and they come forth when we speak with each other. But the Prophet says that the order of nature was by them inverted, for they had <i>taught their tongues to lie</i> We also hence learn that they had no fidelity whatever; for their very tongues had been 			 taught to deceive: as when one by practice has learnt anything, it is what he does readily; so when the tongues are formed by continual use and inured to lying, they can do nothing else.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p9"></a>He says at last, that they <i>wearied themselves with evil deeds.</i> This is indeed an hyperbolical language; but yet the Prophet very fitly sets forth the deplorable state of the people, — that they practiced the doing of evil even to weariness. As when any one is seized with some foolish lust, he spares no labor 			 and does himself much harm, but feels not his wearied state as long as he is engaged, for his ardor dementares him: so he says now, that they were wearied in doing evil. When a hunter pursues the game, he undergoes much more labor than any common workman, or any husbandman. We see that even kings and courtiers, while hunting, are so blinded, that they see no danger nor feel any weariness. So we find that men given to pleasure, when lust draws them here and there, feel no concern for the 			 greatest weariness. According to this sense then the Prophet says, that they were wearied in doing evil, as though he had said, that they were so devoted to wickedness, that the pleasure of doing evil wholly blinded them and made them mad.  			  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">238</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p13"></a>We now perceive the Prophet’s meaning: He confirms, as I have said, what he had stated before. He had threatened the people with utter ruin; they were secure and heedless, and despised all his denuncitations. He now shews, from God’s nature and office, that ruin was nigh them, though they feared it not and thought themselves abundantly safe. But if God be the judge of the world, as it will be hereafter proved, how is it possible for him to 			 connive perpetually at so great wickedness?

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.viii-p5"></a><a name="xix.viii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p6"></a>The Prophet here introduces God as the speaker, that the Jews might know that they had not to do with mortal man. For they might, according to their usual perverseness, have raised this objection, “Thou indeed severely condemnest us, and treatest us reproachfully; but who has made thee our judge?” Lest then they should think that the words which he had hitherto declared, were the words of man, he interposes the authority of 			 God, <i>Thou, </i>he says, <i>dwellest in the midst of a deceitful people</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p7"></a>But we must observe that this admonition to the Prophet was necessary for two reasons. For when God searches the minds and hearts of men by his word, ministers of the word are necessary to exercise this jurisdiction, men endued with wisdom, understanding, and prudence. The word, says the apostle, is like a two — edged sword, or it is one that cuts on both sides, for it penetrates into the hearts and thoughts of man and into their very 			 marrow. (<a name="xix.viii-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012">Heb 4:12</a><a name="xix.viii-p7.1"></a>.) We also know what Paul says,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.viii-p8"></a>“When an unbeliever comes into your assembly, his conscience is searched; so that he will be constrained to fall down and to give glory to God.” (<a name="xix.viii-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024">1 Cor. 14:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025">25</a><a name="xix.viii-p8.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p9"></a>To the same purpose is this saying of Christ,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.viii-p10"></a>“When the Spirit is come, He will judge the world,” <br> 			 (<a name="xix.viii-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a><a name="xix.viii-p10.2"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p11"></a>for by the Spirit He means the preaching of the Gospel. It is then necessary that the ministers of the word, in order that they may faithfully and profitably perform their office, should be taught to understand the deceits and subterfuges by which men are wont to deceive. As then there are many hidden things in the hearts of men, he who would effectually teach must know that the innermost recesses of the heart must be probed and searched. 			 The Prophet had heard from God that the people, over whom He was appointed, were fallacious and filled with guiles and frauds: <i>Thou, </i>He says, <i>dwellest in the midst of a deceitful people; </i>as though he had said, “Thou hast to do with dishonest men, who not only openly betray their wickedness, but also deceive when they pretend any repentance or profess obedience to God: that they may not therefore weaken or cajole thy resolution by their deceptions, settle it in thy mind that thou 			 wilt have to contend with their wiles.” This is one reason.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p12"></a>There is another reason; for as God’s servants ought to know their wiles, which they are bidden to reprove, so there is need of courage and perseverance, lest hypocrisy should dishearten them: for such a thought as this may occur to the minds of God’s servants, “What shall I do? for hidden to me are the thoughts of men: now the truth ought to penetrate into the whole soul; but I know not what lies hid within in any one.” Thus 			 pious teachers might be weakened in their efforts and disheartened, or wholly discouraged, unless God supported them. It was then for this reason that Jeremiah was expressly told, that He had to do with a deceitful and false people. 			  <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">239</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p19"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>Through guile they refuse to know me</i> God had before complained, that he was not known by the people; but he now exaggerates their crime by saying, that they craftily evaded every light, as though he had said, that they could not plead ignorance or any levity; for through guile, says 			 God, they refuse to know me. As they wholly flattered themselves with deceptions, they designedly extinguished, as far as they could, the light. By guile then he means that obstinate craftiness by which the people cast aside every instruction. It afterwards follows —</p>  <a name="xix.ix"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.ix-p5"></a><a name="xix.ix-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ix-p6"></a>Jeremiah, speaking in God’s name, concludes that the chastisement, of which he had spoken, was necessary; And what I have already said appears more clearly from this verse, — that he brings to light their sins, that they might know that they could not escape God’s hand, who is a just avenger of wickedness; for they had extremely provoked him by their petulance and obstinacy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ix-p7"></a><i>I will try</i> or melt <i>them, </i>he says, <i>and I will prove them</i> As they put on a false color, he says that there was a trial needful, as when any one shews copper or any other metal 			 for gold, he is disproved by trial. Any impostor might otherwise sell dross for silver: the spurious metal, that is passed as gold or silver, must be proved; it must be cast into the fire and melted. As then the Jews thought that they had honest pretences to cover their baseness, God gives this answer, that he had yet a way to discover their deceitfulness, and as it were tells them, “The goldsmith, when any one brings dross for silver, or copper 			 for gold, has a furnace, and he tries it; so will I <i>try </i>and melt you; for you think that you can dazzle ray eyes by false pretences: this will avail you nothing.” In short, God intimates that he had means ready at hand to discover their deceitfulness, and that thus their hypocrisy would be of no advantage to them, as his judgments would be like a furnace. As then stubble or wood, cast into the furnace, is immediately burnt, so hypocrites cannot 			 endure God’s judgment. They indeed at first exhibit some brightness, until God tries them; but their deceits must eventually be discovered; and they themselves will be consumed when they come to be really proved. This is the meaning.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ix-p8"></a>And the reason is added, <i>For how should I do with the daughter of my people? </i>This may be applied to Jeremiah himself; but it would be a strained meaning. He then continues, I have no doubt, to speak in God’s name; <i>How </i>then <i>should I do, </i>or act, <i>with the daughter of my people? </i>God speaks here as one deliberating; and thus he more fully proves the Jews guilty; for since he admits them as judges or counsellors, they could give no other reply. We hence see that this question is very emphatic; for the Prophet intimates, that except the 			 Jews were beyond measure stupid, they could no longer flatter themselves in their sins, so as to demand to be otherwise treated by God, as they had in so many ways and with s.uch perversity procured vengeance for themselves.  			  <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">240</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.ix-p14"></a>But we hence learn that it is right that judgment should begin at the house of God, as it is elsewhere said. (<a name="xix.ix-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017">1Pe 4:17</a><a name="xix.ix-p14.1"></a>.) God indeed will not pass by anytliing without punishing it: hence the heathens must at last stand before his tribunal. But as he is nearer to his Church, their impiety, who profess themselves to be as it were his domestics, is less 			 tolerable, as though he had said, “I have chosen you to be my peculiar people, and have taken you under my care and protection; when ye become intractable, what remains for me to do, but to try you, as ye act so unfaithfully towards me.” It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.x"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.x-p5"></a><a name="xix.x-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.x-p6"></a>The Prophet again complains of the deceitfulness of their tongues; and he compares them to deadly, or drawn out arrows. Gold is said to be drawn out, when refined by repeated meltings; so also arrows, when sharpened, are more piercing. The Prophet then says, that their tongues were like deadly or sharpened arrows: how so? because they ever spoke guile, by either slandering or circumventing others. But the expression is general; and the Prophet 			 no doubt meant to include all modes of deceiving.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.x-p7"></a>For it afterwards follows, <i>With the mouth they speak peace; </i>that is, every one professed friendship, and his words were honey; and yet <i>within he did set up, </i>or concealed <i>intrigues. </i>Here in other words he sets forth their perfidy; for the tongue and the heart differed. They shewed by the tongue what was different from the sentiment of the heart. Hence he says, that they <i>set up treacheries in the midst of them, </i>or in their hearts, while they <i>spoke peace 			 </i>with the mouth, that is, pretended brotherly kindness.  			  <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">241</font></a>

 <p><a name="xix.xi-p6"></a>We have already met with this verse; it will therefore be enough briefly to refer to what it contains. God shews here, that except he denied himself he must necessarily punish the Jews. How so? He takes it as granted that he is the judge of the world: he had said that the Jews were not only become wicked in one thing, but were so given up to all kinds of wickedness, that they wearied themselves; what then was to be done? God would not have 			 acted in a manner worthy of himself, nor preserved consistency, had he not punished such men; for he must have changed his nature, had he not hated such a perverse nation. But he speaks after the manner of men when he mentions vengeance; for we know that no passions belong to God, as it has been often stated: but as he hates wickedness, so he is said to execute vengeance, when he appears as a judge and chastises those by whom he has been provoked to wrath.</p>  <a name="xix.xii"></a>

 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p6"></a>The Prophet had exhorted others to lament and to bewail. He now comes forth as though none had ears to attend to his admonition. As then he himself undertakes to mourn and to lament, he no doubt indirectly condemns the insensibility of the whole people. He saw by the spirit of prophecy, that all the rest thought what he said incredible and therefore fabulous. For though the kingdom of Judah was at that time much wasted, and the kingdom of 			 Israel wholly fallen, they yet continued secure and heedless when they ought to have expected God’s vengeance every day, and even every hour. Since then there was such insensibility in the people, the Prophet here prepares himself for lamentation and mourning.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p7"></a><i>I will take up, </i>he says, <i>mourning and lamentation for the mountains</i> The words may be explained, “I will take up mourning, which shall ascend as far as the mountains;” but 			 the cause of mourning seems rather to be intended; for it immediately follows<i>, and weeping for the pastures of the desert</i> Had not this clause been added, the former meaning might be taken, that is, that mourning would be so loud as to penetrate into the mountains or ascend into the highest parts. But as Jeremiah connects the two clauses, for <i>the mountains, </i>and <i>for the pastures of the desert, </i>the other meaning is much more appropriate, — that the confidence of the people was very absurd, as they thougilt themselves beyond danger, dwelling as they did on the plains; for the enemies, he says, shall leave nothing untouched; 			 they shall come to the mountains and to the pastures of the desert. It hence follows, that they were foolish who promised themselves quietness on the plains, where the enemy could easily come.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p8"></a>We now then understand the Prophet’s meaning: he sets here his own fear and solicitude in contrast with the stupor of the whole people. <i>I will raise,</i> he says, <i>weeping and lamentation for the mountains: </i>but others remained secure and thoughtless in their pleasures. He then shews, that while they were blind, his eyes were open, and he saw the coming ruin which was now at hand. And he sets the mountains and pastures of the desert in opposition to the level country. For when a country is laid waste, we know that still a retreat is sought on mountains; for enemies dread ambushes there, and access is not easy where the roads are narrow. Then the Prophet says, that even the mountains 			 would not be beyond the reach of danger, for the enemies would march there: he says the same of the pastures of the desert. We hence learn how absurd was their confidence who thought themselves safe because they inhabited the plain country, which was the most accessible.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p9"></a>As to the word <a name="xix.xiv-p9.1"></a> נאות<i>naut, </i>it comes from <a name="xix.xiv-p9.2"></a> נוה<i>hue, </i>which means to dwell.  			  <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">242</font></a>
  			  He then takes <a name="xix.xiv-p10.6"></a>נאות <i>haut, </i>as signifying pleasant places, or pastures. Some render it sheds or cottages. David uses the same word in <a name="xix.xiv-p10.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002">Ps 23:2</a><a name="xix.xiv-p10.7"></a>, in 			 speaking of God’s favor to him, who was pleased to become his shepherd:</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xiv-p11"></a>“He makes me to lie down,” he says, “in pleasant places.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p12"></a>But the Prophet no doubt means pastures here. And he calls them the <i>pastures of the desert.</i> The word <a name="xix.xiv-p12.1"></a>מדבר<i> midbar, </i>we know, is taken to designate not only waste and sterile 			 places, but also a mountainous country. Though then the richest pastures were on mountains, yet the Jews were wont to call them deserts: there is therefore nothing absurd in saying, the pleasant places or pastures of the desert. But we must bear in mind the contrast, of which I have reminded you: for he intended to condemn the foolish confidence of the people, who thought that they were dwelling in safety, when yet they were exposed to enemies, and had no means to repel or retard their 			 progress.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p13"></a><i>Because they are laid waste,</i> He says. This word may be taken in another sense, “burnt up;” but it is not suitable here. He says then that these places are<i> laid waste, so that no one passed through. He </i>means that 			 mountains would not only be without inhabitants, but would be so deserted and solitary that there would be none passing over them. There would then be none to frequent them. It hence follows, that there would be no inhabitants, He then adds, that <i>no voice of cattle </i>was <i>heard; </i>as though he 			 had said, that their enemies would take away as their spoil whatever should be found there: for the wealth of mountains consists in cattle; for there is neither sowing nor reaping there; but inhabitants of mountains get their living and whatever is necessary to support life, from flesh and skin and milk and cheese. When therefore the Prophet declares that there would be no voice of cattle, it is the same as though he had said, that the mountains would become altogether uninhabited, for their 			 enemies would take away all the cattle found there.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p14"></a>He then adds, <i>From the bird of the heavens to the earthly beast they shall migrate and depart</i>   			  <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">243</font></a>
  			  Here he seems again indirectly to reprove the insensibility of the people, as though he had said, that the birds would feel it to be the judgment of God, while yet men were wholly insensible; and that there would be a similar feeling in brute animals; as though he had said, that there would be more understanding in birds and animals than in the Jews, who had not only been created in the image of God, but had also been enlightened as to the 			 truth of salvation; for shine among them did the truth of God in the law. Hence the Prophet shews that this stupidity was most shameful; for they were as stupid as if they had no thought and no understanding, while yet birds acknowledged the vengeance of God, and brute animals were terrified by it. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xv"></a>  		   			  				  				
 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.xv-p1"></a><a name="xix.xv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011">Jeremiah 9:11</a><a name="xix.xv-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xv-p5"></a><a name="xix.xv-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xv-p6"></a>The Prophet comes now toJerusalem and the neighhouring cities. He said before, that ruin would reach the mountains and the farthest recesses; but he says now, <i>I will turn Jerusalem into heaps</i> This seemed incredible, for it was a well fortified city, and also full of inhabitants to defend it: we know besides that 			 the Jews were in confederacy with the kingdom of Egypt. This denunciation then was extremely unwelcome to the Jews. But though they thought themselves hitherto safe, yet the Prophet set before their eyes their final destruction. They indeed regarded it as a fable; but they found too late, that the despisers of God gain no advantage in hardening· themselves against his threatenings. We shall meet with this verse again; I shall therefore now pass 			 over it lightly.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xv-p7"></a>He says, that it would be hereafter a <i>place for dragons; </i>as though he had said, that it would be no longer inhabited. He declares the same respecting the cities of Judah, — that they would all be a <i>waste. </i>We hence see how courageous and persevering a mind was 			 Jeremiah endued with, that he dared to preach thus in the midst of the city, and to set himself in opposition to the king and his counsellors, and to the whole people, who wished to be soothed with flatteries, and who had been thus treated by the false prophets. As then Jeremiah was thus bold, as a celestial herald, to denounce on them this dreadful calamity, we hence learn that he was endued with the power of God, and that he did not speak as one commissioned by men; for had he not been 			 sustained by God’s power, he must have been a hundred times disheartened, nor would he have dared to speak a word. This invincible courage seals his doctrine; ibr we hence with certainty learn, that it proceeded from God, because the wonderful power of the ttoly Spirit was evident. He afterwards adds —</p>  <a name="xix.xvi"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xvi-p5"></a><a name="xix.xvi-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p6"></a>Here the Prophet reproves more sharply the insensibility of the people, because none attended to the judgments of God; for though they were apparent, no one considered them. The question arose from astonishment; for it was like something dreadfully monstrous, that so few among the people knew that God would be the punisher of crimes so apparent to all. Had they a particle of understanding, they must have known that a dreadful calamity was 			 nigh at hand, since they continued in so many ways to provoke God. And now that the labor of the Prophet, after having said what ought to have roused them all, had been all in vain; was not this doubly monstrous? For he had spent a long time, and had never ceased to cry; and yet all were deaf, nay, his teaching was treated with contempt.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p7"></a>Hence is his astonishment, when he says, <i>Who is a wise man? </i>he intimates that there was hardly one in a hundred whom the fear of God influenced. It must then be remembered, that the Prophet complains of the few number of those who perceived:, that it could not be but that God would shortly put forth his hand to punish the wickedness 			 which then everywhere prevailed. But yet he exhorts all the faithful children of God to disregard the nmltitude, and to gather courage, and to make more account of God’s word than of the contumacy of them all. There are then two things in this sentence; for the question means, that few could be found among the people who were wise, and who applied their minds and thoughts to consider the miserable state of the people; but, on the other hand, he intimates that it is true wisdom in God’s faithful 			 servants, not to despond, and not to follow the nmltitude. He then intimates that they are alone truly wise who consider God’s judgments before He openly executes them. There is a similar sentence in <a name="xix.xvi-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#000">Psalm 107</a><a name="xix.xvi-p7.1"></a>: 43; for the Prophet, after having spoken of God’s judgments, which are visible through the whole world, exclaims,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xvi-p8"></a>“Who is a wise man, that he may understand these things?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p9"></a>as though he had said, that though the works of God, which evidence both his goodness and his judgment, might indeed be observed in every part of the world, yet that all were blind. The Prophet then by this exclamation reprobates the insensibility of men, who overlook God’s judgments, though they are apparent before their eyes. So also the same thing is meant in this place, <i>Who is a wise man?</i> But we must further notice the second thing, to which I have referred, namely, that all the faithful are here encouraged, as the Prophet teaches us, that this is the rule of wisdom, — to open our eyes to see God’s judgments, which are hid from the world: while others are drawn away by their lusts or sunk in their stupor, the Prophet teaches us, that we are wise, when we duly consider, as I have already said, what the Lord has 			 made known to us in his word. Hence it follows, that all the wise men of this world are foolish, who so harden themselves, that they do not perceive in God’s word what is yet open to their eyes. <i>Who </i>then <i>is a wise man, and he will understand these things?</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p10"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>To whom has the mouth of Jehovah spoken to declare this? </i>He complains here that there were no prophets. He said, at the beginning of the verse, that there were none wise, because all heedlessly despised the threatenings and judgments of God: now in the second place he 			 adds, there were none to arouse the careless people who were asleep in their sins. But by this sentence he claims authority for himself; for though he was without associates and assistants, he yet intimates that his teaching was not, on that account of less value: “Be<i> it,” </i>he says, (for he speaks by way of concession,) “be<i> 			 </i>it, that there is no prophet to recall the people from their sins, to exhort them to repent, to terrify the ungodly: however this may be, yet the Lord has appointed me to teach and to exhort the people.” We hence see that the Prophet claims for himself full and complete authority, though he alone denounced God’s vengeance. Many indeed then boasted that they were prophets; but they were only false flatterers. When the Prophet saw that many abused the name, and did not 			 perform the office faithfully and sincerely, he set himself in opposition to them all; as though he had said, “It is enough that the Lord has commanded me to do this; I therefore denounce on you this calamity, which ye heedlessly disregard, because false teachers deeeive you by their mischievous adulations.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p11"></a><i>Who will declare, </i>he says, <i>why the land is to perish, </i>and to be <i>laid waste like the desert, so that there should be no inhabitant? </i>We may apply this to two periods. For when Jeremiah spoke, the kingdom was yet standing, and, as I have said, the Jews were not so subdued as to humble themselves before God: they were therefore still indulging themselves in their sins. Now whence did this indulgence proceed, except from their prosperous condition? Yet the Prophet says that the land had perished, and justly so; but he says this, because he did not judge of the people’s state according to 			 what it appeared then to be, but according to the judgment which he saw by the prophetic spirit was impending over them. And we may extend this farther; as though Jeremiah had said, “When God shall have so chastised this people, that there may be as it were a visible monument of celestial wrath; there shall yet be then no prophets to remind them whence these evils have proceeded.” This indeed we know was the case, when the city was partly burnt and partly demolished, and the temple pulled down: the contumacy of the people was so great, that their hearts were stone, and their minds iron. There was then a monstrous 			 hardness in that calamity. They indeed cried for their evils; but no one perceived that God was executing what he had denounced for so many years. For Jeremiah, as we have said, exercised his office of teaching for a long time: but before he began, Isaiah had already been were out; and before Isaiah, Micah had prophesied. Though, however, threatenings had been renewed daily for a hundred years, and terrors had been announced, yet there was no one who attended.  			  <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">244</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p15"></a>This passage, then, may be thus explained, — That when threatenings should appear by the effect not to have been announced in vain, yet the people would even then be insensible, for no one would attend to nor consider God’s judgment: they would all indeed feel their evils, but no one would regard the hand of him who smote them, as it is said in another place. (<a name="xix.xvi-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013">Isa 9:13</a><a name="xix.xvi-p15.1"></a>.) Either meaning may be allowed; but, as I think, the Prophet here deplores the hardness and contumacy of the people at that time; as though he had said, that there were none who considered God’s judgments, and that there was no prophet to rouse those who were torpid. But yet, as it has been stated, he thus intimates, that he had sufficient authority, though he had no associate or assistant; for he had been chosen by God, and had been sent to carry this message. It 			 follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xvii"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xvii-p9"></a><a name="xix.xvii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p10"></a>Jeremiah now confirms what I have stated, and more fully explains it, — that though no teacher or a disciple was found in the land, yet there was sufficient power in God’s word alone, and that his judgment depended not on the will or the perceptions of men. After having then complained that all were foolish, and that there were no prophets to reprove their security and indifference, he adds, <i>Thus saith Jehovah</i> Here he sets God in opposition to all men, to the king and his courtiers, as well as to the common people. Who then is a wise man? as though He looked around him; and there was no man who considered. he was then in suspense; and afterwards he said, “There is no prophet to rouse them from their usual stupor.” He remained still in suspense; and then he turned to God and said, 			 “But Jehovah has spoken;” that is, “Be it, that they are like brute beasts, though they arrogate to themselves great wisdom; nevertheless God speaks, and we ought to be satisfied. We ought then to be silent, and to make no stir; though no one approves, though no one attends to God speaking, there is yet sufficient authority and power in his voice alone.” We now then more fully understand the Prophet’s design: He had said that all men were 			 stupid, and that there was no prophet; and now, on the other hand, he shews that God was not silent nor asleep.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p11"></a><i>Thus saith Jehovah, Because </i>this people <i>have forsaken my law, etc</i>. He shews that the cause of all evils was a departure from God’s law. No one was willing to confess this, and all the prophets were silent; yet Jeremiah says here, that the 			 cause was to be asked of God why he so grievously afflicted the people. But he takes as granted what was most true, that God was not without reason displeased with the chosen people. It hence then follows, that they were apost, ates, and had forsaken the law: God would not have otherwise so severely punished them. Though then no one perceived the cause of their evils, though no one shewed it, yet God himself ought to have been attended to, who said, that they had <i>forsaken the law</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p12"></a>He then adds, <i>Which l have set before their face.</i> Here he takes away every pretense for ignorance; for they might have objected and said, that the doctrine of the law was obscure, and that they were deceived through want of knowledge. The Prophet anticipates 			 this objection by saying, that the law was set before them; that is, that they were abundantly taught what was right, what pleased God; so that they now in vain and even falsely pleaded ignorance; for they went astray wilfully by closing their eyes against clear light., For this is what he means by saying that the law was set before their face: and it is what Moses often repeats,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xvii-p13"></a>“Behold, I have set before thee,” <br> 			 (<a name="xix.xvii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#032">De 11:32</a><a name="xix.xvii-p13.2"></a>, and elsewhere:)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p14"></a>and this he said, that the people might not seek for themselves vain excuses for ignorance, as they were wont to do.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p15"></a>But while we are not to overlook this circumstance, we may yet hence learn this general truth, — that the law of God is not so obscure but that we may learn from it what is right. When, therefore, Moses is quoted, and the prophets are added as interpreters, there is no ground for us to evade, or to make the excuse, that the truth is too hidden or profound; for the law is set before our face, that, the will of God may be 			 made known to us. Whosoever then can read and hear what God has revealed once to the world by Moses and the prophets is inexcusable; for we are taught here, and in other places, that it is a mere perverseness in all who hear the law, when they do not obey: <i>I have set the law,</i> he says, <i>before their 			 face</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p16"></a>And he adds, <i>And they have not hearkened to my voice, and have not walked in it</i> He defines what it is not to hearken to his voice: for even hypocrites pretend to hear, and nod with their ears like asses; but as they obey not God when he speaks, it is evident that they are deaf. Hence He says that they 			 <i>walked not </i>in his voice,  			  <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">245</font></a>
  			  that is, that they obeyed not his voice. He hence concludes that they were deaf; for their life ought to have testified that they had heard the voice of God speaking to them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xvii-p18"></a><a name="xix.xvii-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p19"></a>He then adds,<i> And they have walked after the hardiness, </i>or <i>obstinacy</i>, or <i>imaginations</i>, <i>of their own heart</i>   			  <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">246</font></a>
  			  He opposes the imaginations, or hardness of the heart, to the voice of God, as we find in other places, where contrary things are stilted, that is, what men’s minds devise, and what God shews by his word to be right; for there is no less contrariety between the rule of right living and the imaginations of men, than there is between fire and water. Let us therefore know, that our life cannot 			 be rightly formed except we renounce our own imaginations, and simply obey the voice of God: for as soon as we yield the least to our own imaginations, we necessarily turn aside from the right way, which God has made known to us in his word. This contrast, then, between the law of God and the imaginations or the obduracy of men ought to be carefully noticed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xvii-p21"></a>He then more clearly explains how they had sinned, <i>and after Baalim</i>   			  <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">247</font></a>
  			  The Prophet here adds nothing new; but by specifying one thing he shews how the Jews followed their own imaginations, by giving themselves up to profane superstitions. What indeed must happen to men, when they forsake God, and allow themselves to follow their own thoughts? what but error and superstition, yea, the abyss of all errors? In short, the Prophet in this clause intended to cut off every occasion for subterfuges; for the Jews, like 			 hypocrites, who sophistically deal with God, might have made this evasion, and said, “Why dost thou object to us our imaginations? what are these imaginations?” <i>Baalim, </i>he says, “Ye have devised idols far yourselves in addition to the only true God; it is hence quite evident, that having forsaken God’s word, ye have followed your own imaginations.” He adds to Baalim, <i>as their fathers have taught them: </i>the relative <a name="xix.xvii-p22.3"></a>אשר, <i>asher, </i>is to be taken for <a name="xix.xvii-p22.4"></a>כ <i>caph, </i>as.  			  <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">248</font></a>

 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="xix.xviii-p1"></a>PRAYER</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xviii-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only testified what is right by the Law and the Prophets, in order that we may form our life in obedience to thy will, but hast also made more fully known to us by thy Gospel what is perfect righteousness, — O grant, that being ruled by thy Spirit, we may surrender ourselves altogether to thee, and so acquiesce in thy Word alone, that we may not deviate either to the right hand or to the left, 			 but allow thee alone to be wise, and that acknowledging our folly and vanity, we may suffer ourselves to be taught by thy Word, so that we may really prove that we are truly obedient to thee, until having at length completed the course of this life, we shall reach that heavenly rest which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.</p>  <a name="xix.xix"></a>  		  
 <p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref23"><a name="xix.xix-p1"></a>Lecture Thirty-Seventh</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p2"></a>We explained yesterday what the Prophet said respecting the Jews, that though no one considered the reason why God so severely afflicted them, yet they could not escape in this way, and that they in vain set up the shield of iglnorance, for God had often declared that he abominated their superstitions. Though then they were all blind, and no prophet shewed to them the cause of their evils, yet 			 Jeremiah said, that this alone was sufficient — that God had spoken, and would again speak to them. He said that they were not submissive to God’s authority, but walked after the hardness of their own heart, and after Baalim. He added, that they had been <i>thus taught by their fathers</i> By this clause he exaggerated their sin; for they did not then begin for the first time to sin, 			 but became obstinate in their vices.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p3"></a>We may learn from this passage how foolishly the Papists now glory in imitating the fathers: for they think that examples stand for laws; nay, they hesitate not to oppose. God’s authority by what has been done by men. But we see that such an excuse is not only frivolous, but that thereby the crime is doubled; for more excusable is the ignorance of one year, or of a short time, than when there is a long obstinate persistency in it, and 			 when children, after having embraced abominations, received from their fathers, hand them down to their posterity.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xix-p4"></a><a name="xix.xix-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p5"></a>He at length concludes that God would take vengeance, but speaks in a figurativle language, <i>I will feed them with bitterness</i> The word <a name="xix.xix-p5.1"></a>לענה<i> lone, </i>is rendered “wormwood;” but as 			 this is a wholesome herb, I prefer to render it “bitterness.”  			  <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">249</font></a>
  			  It is never found in a good sense, and therefore unsuitable to the nature of wormwood, which is often mentioned by Moses: and the other prophets (<a name="xix.xix-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#018">De 19:18</a><a name="xix.xix-p6.2"></a>; <a name="xix.xix-p6.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032">De 32:32</a><a name="xix.xix-p6.3"></a>; <a name="xix.xix-p6.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015">Heb 2:15</a><a name="xix.xix-p6.4"></a>.) Hence I am inclined to adopt a general term, <i>“bitterness.” </i>He then adds, <i>I will give them poisonous waters to drink;</i>  			  <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">250</font></a>
  			  as though God had said that he would execute a dreadful vengeance, so that it would appear in the meat and drink given them, which yet were remarkable testimonies of his paternal kindness towards them: for we cannot eat a crumb of bread nor drink a drop of water, except God’s goodness, and the care which he takes for our safety, shines upon us. Hence is that awful imprecation in <a name="xix.xix-p7.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022">Ps. 69:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023">23</a><a name="xix.xix-p7.3"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xix-p8"></a>“Turned let their table be into an offense.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p9"></a>David also complained, when describing the barbarous cruelty of his enemies, that they gave him gall to drink: and we shall hereafter see what Jeremiah says; for in speaking. of his enemies, he says that they had conspired to put him to death, and said,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xix-p10"></a>“Let us set wood for his bread.” (<a name="xix.xix-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019">Jer 11:19</a><a name="xix.xix-p10.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p11"></a>By these words then Jeremiah intended to express the dreadful vengeance of God; for he would not onty deprive the Jews of his benefits, but also turn their bread into poison, and their water into bitterness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xix-p12"></a>We now then perceive the Prophet’s meaning; and at the same time we must observe the expression, <i>the God of Israel</i> The foolish boasting, that they were the descendants of Abraham, and that they were a holy people, chosen by God, always deluded the Jews. In order then to check their glorying, the Prophet 			 says, float the God who spoke to them was the God whose name they falsely professed, and that he was the God who had chosen the children of Abraham as his peculiar people. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xx"></a>  		   			  				  				
 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.xx-p1"></a><a name="xix.xx-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016">Jeremiah 9:16</a><a name="xix.xx-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xx-p5"></a><a name="xix.xx-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xx-p6"></a>As he had said that the Jews were following what theyhad received from their fathers,so he says now that God would <i>scatter them among nations,</i>which had been unknown to them and to their fathers. He then alludes to their mischievous tradition; for the fathers had imbued their children with ungodly errors, and had 			 withdrawn them from God, that their doctrine might become altogether familiar to them. There is then a contrast to be noticed between the knowledge with which the fathers had inebriated their children, and their ignorance of the language of the nations.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xx-p7"></a>And then as he had said, that they were walking after the hardness of their own heart and after Baalim, he says, <i>I will send a sword after them</i> We hence see that the Prophet in both clauses alludes to the defection of which he had spoken. And he adds, <i>Until I 			 shall have consumed them; </i>and this is added, that they might not promise themselves a temporary or a moderate chastisement. Jeremiah then declares, that as they had abused God’s forbearance, destruction was nigh them, and that God would contimle to consume them, until he had wholly destroyed them. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xxi"></a>

 <p><a name="xix.xxi-p8"></a>In this passage, as in many others, the Prophet endeavors by a striking representation really to touch the hearts of his people, for he saw that they were extremely refractory, insensible, and secure. Since then the threatenings of God were either wholly despised, or had not sufficiently moved the hearts of the people, it was necessary to set forth God’s judgments as present. Therefore the Prophet gives a striking description of what takes 			 place in times of mourning. At the same time he seems to condemn indirectly the Jews for not knowing, through God’s word, that there was a calamity at hand: for God’s word ought indeed to be like a mirror, by which men ought to see God’s goodness in his promises and also his judgment in his threatenings. As then all prophecies were deemed as fables by the people, it was not without some degree of derision that he addressed them in this manner, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxi-p9"></a><i>Hearken ye, and call for mourners, that they may come</i> An absurd and a foolish custom has prevailed almost in all ages to hire women as mourners, whom they called <i>proeficoe; </i>they were employed to mourn for others. Heirs no doubt hired these foolish women, in 			 order to shew their reigned piety; they spoke in praise of the dead, and shewed how great a loss was their death. The Prophet does not commend this custom; and we ought to know that Scripture often takes similes from the vices of men, as from filth and dirt. If then any one concludes from these winds of Jeremiah, that lamentations at funerals are not to be condemned, this would be foolish and puerile. The Prophet, on the contrary, does here reprove the Jews, because they heedlessly disregarded 			 all God’s threatenings, and were at the same time soft and tender at those foolish exhibitions, and all mourned at the sight of those women who were hired to lament; as the case is at this time, when a faithful teacher reprobates the prevailing folly of the Papists. For when the unprincipled men, who occupy the pulpits under the Papacy, speak with weeping, though they produce not a syllable from God’s word, but add some spectacle or phantom, by producing the image of the Cross or some like 			 thing, they touch the feelings of the vulgar and cause weeping, according to what actors do on the stage. As then the Papists are seized as it were with an insane feeling, when their deceivers thus gesticulate, so a faithful teacher may say to them, “Let any one come and set before your eyes the image of a dead man, or say, that you must all shortly die and be like the earcase shewn to you, and ye will cry and weep; and yet ye will sot consider 			 how dreadful God’s judgment is, which I declare to you: I shew to you faithfully from the law, from the prophets, and from the Gospel; how dreadful is God’s vengeance, and set before you what ye deserve; yet none of you are moved; but my doctrine is a mockery to you, and also my reproofs and threatenings: go then to your prophets, who shew you pictures and the like trumperies.” So the Prophet says now, “I see that I can do you no good; the Lord will therefore give you no teachers but women.” Of 			 what sort? Even such, he says, as lament, or are hired to mourn.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxi-p10"></a>We now then perceive why the Prophet speaks of hired women. <i>Attend ye, </i>he says; and why? They ought indeed to have been attentive to or to understand (for <a name="xix.xxi-p10.1"></a>בן <i>ben, </i>means properly to understand, and in Hithpael it 			 signifies to consider) his words; but as he saw that he was ridiculed or despised, and that all the threatenings which proceeded from God were esteemed as fables, he now says, <i>“Consider ye and call for your lamenters:</i> — as I see such perverseness in you, be taught at least by those women who are commonly invited to lament, and who sell their tears!” 			 <i>Send, </i>he says, <i>for the skilfu1, that they may come</i> By these words he intended more clearly to express, that the calamity which the people feared not was not far distant.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxi-p11"></a><a name="xix.xxi-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxi-p12"></a><i>Let them, </i>he says, <i>take up for us a wailing, and let our eyes come down to tears, and let our eyelids flow down into waters</i> These are hyperbolical words, and yet they do not exceed the intensehess of the coming 			 vengeance: for it was not in vain that he said at the begSnning of the chapter, “Who will make my head waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears?” As then the greatness of the calamity could be expressed by no words, the Prophet was constrained to adopt these hyperbolical expressions: <i>Let them </i>then <i>take up for us a wailing, that our eyes may come down 			 to tears: </i>and this he said, because he saw that he was heard with dry eyes, and that the people disregarded what had been denounced:, when yet all ought to have been smitten with fear, from the least to the greatest. As then the Prophet saw that their contempt was so brutal, he says, that when lainenters came, there would then be the time for wailing, not indeed the seasonable time; but it is the same as though he had said, that the 			 Jews would then find out how insensible they had been, in not having in due time considered the judgment of God.  			  <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">251</font></a>

 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.xxii-p1"></a><a name="xix.xxii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019">Jeremiah 9:19</a><a name="xix.xxii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxii-p5"></a><a name="xix.xxii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxii-p6"></a>We have said before, that when Jeremiah addressed the people in these words, they were still in a tolerably good condition, so that the king had confidence in his own resources; and his counsellors also thought that some aid would come to them from Egypt, and the people were likewise deceived. But the Prophet speaks of future events and points out as by the finger the evils which were as yet concealed from the view; for he could not 			 otherwise teach with any authority, as he had to do with men of iron hearts. As then he saw that his teaching had no effect, and was wholly disregarded by men so slothful, he felt it necessary to form his style so as to touch their feelings.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxii-p7"></a>On this account he says, that a <i>voice was heard, a voice of wailing from Sion; </i>where yet all exulted with joy. Then he adds, <i>How have we been destroyed! and made greatly ashamed!</i> The Jews 			 thought this a fable, until they found by experience that they had been extremely hard and obstinate: but this really happened. Though they were then indulging in their pleasures, he yet proclaims lamentations to them, as though they were already destroyed: <i>A voice, </i>he says, <i>has been heard, </i>as though the Jews were bewailing the calamity, respecting which they thought the Prophet was fabling, for no danger was yet apparent.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxii-p8"></a>But in order, as I have said, to condemn the hardness of their hearts, he represents them in another character, as bewailing their ruinous condition, and saying, <i>We have left the land; </i>in which however they thought their dwelling would be perpetual; for they boasted that they could never be excluded, as it 			 had been declared,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xxii-p9"></a>“This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.” <br> 			 (<a name="xix.xxii-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Ps 132:14</a><a name="xix.xxii-p9.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxii-p10"></a>As then God had testified that it would be a quiet habitation to his people, they thought that they were fortified by a triple wall and rampart, and that the city was altogether unassailable. But Jeremiah represents them as saying, that they had left their own land, that is, that they had been drawn and driven into exile. Then he adds, <i>because they have cast us 			 out</i> This seems to refer to their enemies who had cast them out, that is, pulled down their dwellings. Some take dwellings to be the nominative case to the verb, “<i>Our dwellings have cast us out</i>.”  			  <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">252</font></a>
  			  But the first meaning reads better: I therefore consider the sense to be simply this, — that they were cast out and that their houses were destroyed by their enemies. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xxiii"></a>  		   			  				  				
 <p class="TableCaption30"><a name="xix.xxiii-p1"></a><a name="xix.xxiii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020">Jeremiah 9:20-21</a><a name="xix.xxiii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxiii-p7"></a><a name="xix.xxiii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p8"></a>He proceeds with the same subject, but adopts another figure. He then somewhat changes the comparison; for he had bidden them before to hire women to excite to mourning by fictitious tears, but he now addresses women in general; as though he had said, that such would be the mourning, that hired lamentations would not be sufficient, for the calamity would touch all hearts, and that mercenary wailing would not be real. 			 <i>Hear, </i>he says, <i>ye women</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p9"></a>Why he addresses women may be accounted for in two ways: the softness of women more easily leads them to weep; there may be also here an indirect condemnation of the men, that they were deaf and so hardened that no threatenings terrified them. But the first seems to be the most suitable reason here, provided we still understand that real mourning is opposed to reigned mourning. Then Jeremiah passes from the particular to 			 the general; that is, after having spoken of hired women, he now includes all women; for lamentation would prevail in every city, and also in every house: <i>Hear </i>then, <i>ye women, the word of Jehovah</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p10"></a>And he adds, <i>and let your ears receive the word of his mouth</i> He mentions on the one hand the <i>mouth </i>of God, and on the other the <i>ears </i>of women. It seems indeed a redundancy, but the repetition is not 			 superfluous. Had he said only, “Let your ears hear the word of his mouth,” there would have been a redundancy; but he spoke before only of the word of God, and hear ye; now he adds, the <i>mouth </i>of God, and the <i>ears </i>of women. The Prophet no doubt intended to rebuke that hardness which we have often noticed. The word of God was deemed of no moment; hence he says, the <i>mouth 			 </i>of God: as though he had said, “God speaks with you as it were from mouth to mouth: for though he employs my labor, I am yet but his instrument; so that you may easily find out that I declare nothing presumptuously, but faithfully deliver what I have received from him.” We hence see how emphatical is this repetition, which may seem at first sight to be superfluous. The same emphasis belongs to the <i>ears </i>of women; it is as though he had said, that they had been hitherto extremely indifferent, and that it was time for their ears to be attentive.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p11"></a>He adds, <i>And teach your daughters; </i>as though he had said, that such would be the wailing, that it would reach not only the old and the middle-aged, but even young girls, as yet rude and ignorant. <i>And let every one, </i>he says, <i>teach her neighbor lamentation</i> In short, the meaning is, that no women, old or young, would be exempt from this mourning, as all would be implicated in a common sorrow; for God’s judgment would reach every age, sex, and order of men, and would also penetrate into every house.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxiii-p12"></a><a name="xix.xxiii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p13"></a>And by way of explanation he adds, <i>For death has ascended into our windows</i> There is here a kind of derision; for the Jews, as it has been said, had falsely promised to themselves a perpetual impunity; and therefore the Prophet adopts here a most suitable comparison. For as they sleep securely, who with 			 closed doors seem to themselves to be beyond the reach of danger; so the Jews at that time despised God and all his judgments, as though the doors of their houses were closed. Hence the Prophet says, that <i>death </i>had entered in <i>through the windows; </i>and he thus derides their folly for thinking that they could escape the hand of 			 God, because their gates were shut, as though. God’s power could not ascend above the clouds nor enter through their windows, when the doors were closed. In short, he intimates that the doors would not be opened by God; for though he might not be disposed to break them, he could yet immediately ascend into the windows. We now apprehend the Prophet’s design in saying, that <i>death </i>had entered through the <i>windows.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p14"></a>And what he adds respecting <i>palaces </i>bears the same import; as though he had said, “Were our houses even fortified, and were they not. only commodious habitations, but made like citadels, yet God could not be excluded; for his power can penetrate through the highest and the thickest walls, so that a palace is to him like the weakest and frailest cottage.” We hence 			 see that by this comparison he checks that foolisll confidence by which the Jews had deceived themselves, and by which they were as yet inebriated. <i>Death </i>then <i>has ascended into our windows, etc.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p15"></a>He then adds,<i> To cut off the young,</i> or children, <i>from the public ways, and the youths from the streets</i>   			  <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">253</font></a>
  			  By these words he sets forth the dreadfulness of the calamity; for the youths would not be able to defend themselves by their own strength; for by <a name="xix.xxiii-p18.1"></a>בחורים, <i>bechurim, </i>he means the most robust. Even these would not be able to repel the onset of their enemies; though in the flower of 			 their age, yet their rigor, however strong, would not protect them, nor would children and infants be spared. We see that two things are here set forth by the Prophet, — that the assaults of their enemies would be so violent, that young men would in vain resist them, as their vigor would avail them nothing, — and then that such would be the cruelty of their enemies, that no regard would be shewn for age, for they would put to death even infants newly born. It follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xxiv"></a>

 <p><a name="xix.xxiv-p6"></a>Though Jeremiah continues the same subject, he yet introduces a preface, — that he had been commanded to declare what he says here; for on account of the strangeness of the event, the prophecy seemed incredible. He might, indeed, have proceeded with the subject, and omitted the words, <i>“Thus saith Jehovah,” 			 </i>and have begun thus: “Fall shall the carcase of man,” etc. But, as I have said, this prophecy seemed to the greatest part as worthless, as though it was a fable: it was therefore necessary to introduce these words, — that he came forth furnished with God’s command; and he at the same time shews that he introduced nothing of his own, but that God himself spoke. We now perceive why these few words were 			 introduced.  			  <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">254</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiv-p10"></a>He afterwards says, that the <i>carcases of men </i>would be cast forth <i>as dung</i> He speaks by way of reproach, as though he had said, that all would without honor be laid prostrate by their enemies. And he adds a 			 similitude, <i>They shall fall, </i>he says, <i>on the face of the field, </i>that is, everywhere through all the fields shall they fall <i>as dung, </i>which is cast 			 forth, and which excites nausea by its sight and by its odor. Thus the Prophet here denotes foetor and a deformed sight by the comparison of dung: yet we know with what pride were they then filled. This threatening then was to them very disagreeable; but as they flattered themselves in their vices, it was the more necessary to treat them roughly; for thus ought hypocrites to be dealt with, who indulge their own delusions: the more boldly they rise up against God, the more violently ought they 			 to be east down, so that they may at length humble themselves under the mighty hand of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiv-p11"></a>He adds another comparison, <i>As a handful,</i> etc. Jerome renders it “hay.” If <a name="xix.xxiv-p11.1"></a>עמיד <i>omid, </i>were found elsewhere in this sense, I would willingly adopt 			 this meaning; but I rather think that it means those ears of corn which are not gathered while the reapers collect their handfuls. They do not, indeed, leave complete handfuls, nor east them away; but it happens, through carelessness, that a few ears escape them. Then the Prophet says, that the Jews would be like those ears of corn which the reapers pass by and leave behind; and there is no one afterwards to gather them: and those ears of corn which thus remain in the field either rot of 			 themselves, or are devoured by cattle or wild beasts. He then means, that there would be no residue of the people, for all, from the least to the greatest, would be given up to destruction.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxiv-p12"></a>This is the meaning; and at the same time he expresses contempt; for when reapers do not collect the whole produce of the field, there are still the poor, who gather the ears of corn; but when they are trodden under foot, and when there is no one to gather them, it betokens contempt; and this is what the Prophet intended to express. It now follows —</p>  <a name="xix.xxv"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxv-p7"></a><a name="xix.xxv-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxv-p8"></a>This is a remarkable passage, and often found in the mouth of men, as other notable sentences, which are known as proverbial sayings: but yet few rightly consider how these words are connected with the previous context. Hence there are many who are satisfied with a simple explanation, as though it were a subject abruptly introduced, and as though the Prophet commenced something new; and they confine themselves to those words: and thus 			 they misrepresent the meaning of the Prophet, or at least diminish much of the force of what is taught.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxv-p9"></a>The Prophet no doubt has a regard to what has gone before. He saw, as I have often said, that he addressed the deaf; for the Jews were so swollen with false confidence, that the word of God was regarded worthless by them. As then some were proud for their riches, and others thought themselves more prudent than that they could by any means be taken, and others thought themselves so fortified by wealth and power, that they could easily resist 			 any evil, — as then the minds of all were possessed with so much pride, the Prophet, in order to confirm what he had said, declares here that men foolishly gloried, while they set up their riches, or their strength, or their wisdom, in opposition to God; for all these things would vanish away like smoke.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxv-p10"></a>We now then perceive why the Prophet forbids here any to glory except in God alone, and how the passage ought not to be deemed as abrupt, but connected with what he said, when he denounced destruction on the Jews, which yet they dreaded not, because they were filled with this ungodly and foolish conceit, — that they had more than a sufficient protection in their own strength, or riches, or wisdom. The rest to-morrow.</p>  <a name="xix.xxvi"></a>

 <p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref23"><a name="xix.xxvii-p1"></a>Lecture Thirty-Eighth</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p2"></a>We began yesterday to explain what the Prophet means, when he forbids men to glory either in wisdom, or in strength, or in riches. The meaning is, that all are greatly deceived who think themselves blessed while alienated from God. We have also noticed the reason why he speaks of wisdom, strength, and riches, even this, — because it is a vice innate in all mortals to be proud of their own excellency. Whatever we think valuable ought to be 			 acknowledged as received from God. If then all the excellency we have is God’s gift, it is very strange that we do not learn humility when God thus binds us to himself; but that, on the contrary, we abuse his bounty by making it the occasion of pride. This ingratitude has nevertheless ever prevailed in the world. This then is the reason why the Prophet here reduces to nothing all the boastings of the world. There were among the Jews some rich, others excelled in wisdom, and others in power: 			 thus it happened, that heavenly truth was of no value in their esteem. As then some trusted in their riches and not. in God, and others in their wisdom, and others in their valor, the Prophet here declares that all the glory they arrogated on account of God’s temporal gifts, was all nothing. It remained then for the Jews to consider, that all such confidences would avail nothing against God’s judgment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p3"></a>But we may hence learn a general truth; and Paul no doubt had a regard to this passage in <a name="xix.xxvii-p3.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031">1Co 1:31</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p3.1"></a>. He teaches us there, that God chooses what is foolish in the world, that he might thus shame the wisdom of the world, and that he chooses what is weak, that he might upset the strength of the world; and then he adds, That whosoever glories 			 must glory in God alone. He doubtless took this passage from the Prophet; and yet he does not only speak there of strength of body, nor of riches, nor of worldly wisdom; but includes also righteousness, and whatever is deemed valuable or honorable among men. His object, then is to annihilate every glory that belongs to the flesh, that the mercy of God alone may shine forth. Hence I said, that though the Prophet mentions only three things, yet a generaal doctrine may hence be suitably drawn; for 			 what is said of wisdom, strength, and riches, may and ought to be applied to that false conceit of righteousness with which hypocrites swell. We shall now consider the words.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxvii-p4"></a><a name="xix.xxvii-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p5"></a><i>Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise glory, etc</i>   			  <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">255</font></a>
  			  By way of concession he calls those wise who were without the fear of God, which yet we know is the beginning of wisdom. (<a name="xix.xxvii-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010">Ps 111:10</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p6.2"></a>; <a name="xix.xxvii-p6.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pr 1:7</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p6.3"></a>.) But the Prophet speaks according to the common opinion; and the meaning may be thus given, 			 “Let; not him who seenas wise to himself glory in his own wisdom:” and so the other words may be understood. It is then added, <i>But let him who glories, glory in this, </i>etc. It appears from the second verse, that men are not so stripped of all glory, that they may be down in 			 disgrace; but that they may seek a better glory, for God detights not in the degradation of men. But as they arrogate to themselves more than what is right, and even inebriate themselves with delusions, he strips them naked, that after having known that all they think they have, either from nature, or from themselves, or from other creatures, is a mere phantom, they may seek true glory.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p7"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>In understanding and knowing me</i> Though by these two word the Prophet means the same thing, yet they are not used without a design; for as men despised the knowledge of God, it was necessary to remind them, that to know God is the chief part of perfect wisdom. He therefore intended to 			 correct the mischievous error under which almost the whole world labors; for while all attend to wxrious pursuits, the knowledge of God is neglected. We see with what ardor every one pursues his own fancies, while hardly one in a hundred deigns to spend half an hour in the day in seeking the knowledge of God. And there is also another evil, a false opinion, which proceeds from pride, — that to know God is a common thing. We hence perceive why the Prophet has employed these two words to 			 designate the same thing; it was to rouse more fully the attention of men; for he saw that almost all were torpid and indifferent on a subject which is justly entitled to the labor of a whole life; nay, were a hundred lives given us, this one thing would be sufficient to engage our attention. But, as it has been said, what ought to be preferred to all other things is despised and neglected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p8"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>That I am Jehovah, who doeth judgment.</i> By calling himself Jehovah, he doubtless excludes all those devices which then engaged the attention of the Jews; for the whole land was corrupted by so many superstitions, that the name of the only true God was unknown. They all, indeed, professed 			 to worship the God of Abraham, who had delivered to them his law by the hand of Moses; but as many errors were mingled with the true doctrine, God was deprived of his own honor. It was, then, God’s will that he should be so known as to appear alone supreme, and to be alone as it were kept in view. But the explanation which follows ought to be carefully observed; for had he said only, “Let every one who glories, glory in the knowledge of me, that I am Jehovah,” it would, indeed, have been a 			 plain truth, but not sufficiently persplcuous or evident; for the minds of men might have been in suspense, and they might have said, “What does this mean? or, why is it, that God regards the knowledge of himself to be so important? They might also have supposed that it was quite enough to confess him to be the only true God. Hence God here reminds the Jews of his own divine perfections, that they might really know that he is God, and that they might not ascribe to him an empty name. It was for 			 this reason that I have said, that these words, <i>who doeth mercy and judgement and justice, </i>ought to be carefully observed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p9"></a>We see at this day, under the Papacy, that the name of God is presumptuously gloried in: there is no one who is not ready boldly to declare that he worships the one true God, and yet they profane his name; for they afterwards rob God, and bestow the spoils on the dead. This passage then teaches us, that the name of God of itself would be of no importance, if stripped of his power and perfections. Hence we have then only 			 the true knowledge of God, when we not only acknowledge him to be the creator of the world, but when we also fully believe that the world is governed by him, and when we further understand the way in which he governs it, that is, by <i>doing mercy and judgment and justice</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p10"></a>Now, the first thing respecting God is, that we should acknowledge him to be beneficient and bountiful; for what would become of us without the mercy of God? Therefore the true and right knowledge of God begins here, that is, when we know him to be merciful towards us. For what would it avail us to know that God is just, except we had a previous knowledge of his mercy and gratuitous goodness? We cannot know God without knowing ourselves. 			 These two things are connected. Now, if any examines himself, what will he find but what will make him to despair? Thus, whenever God is thought of, we feel a dread, and despair in a manner swallows us up. In short, all avoid God, except the sweetness of his grace allures them. Why? Because, as I have said, there is nothing but what brings misery to us, and a cause of dread. Hence Jeremiah, while bidding men to glory in the knowledge of God, has not in vain given the first and the highest place 			 to his mercy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p11"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>Judgement and justice</i> When these two words are joined together, they denote perfect government; that is, that God defends his faithful people, aids the miserable, and delivers them when unjustly oppressed; and also that he restrains the wicked, and suffers them not to injure the 			 innocent at their pleasure. These then are the things which the Scripture everywhere means by the two words, judgment and justice. The justice of God is not to be taken according to what is commonly understood by it; and they speak incorrectly who represent God’s justice as in opposition to his mercy: hence the common proverb, “I appeal from justice to mercy.” The Scripture speaks otherwise; for <i>justice </i>is to be taken for that faithful 			 protection of God, by which he defends and preserves his own people; and <i>judgment, </i>for the rigor which he exercises against the transgressors of his law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p12"></a>But, as I have already said, judgment and justice, when found together, are to be taken for that legitimate government, by which God so regulates the affairs of the world, that there is nothing but what is just and right: and hence is confirmed more fully what I have already stated, that he not only speaks generally, but intends also to remove the evils which then stood in the way, and prevented the Jews from rightly receiving either 			 promises or threatenings; for a false glory inebriated them all, inasmuch as one thought his riches to be like an invincible fortress; another, his wisdom; and the third, his strength. As then they were full of vain pride, and thus despised God and his heavenly truth, it was necessary to bring them to order, and even wholly to strip them, that they might know that they were not to glory in anything but in the knowledge of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p13"></a>Now, the knowledge mentioned here produces two fruits, even faith and fear; for if we are fully, persuaded that there is propitiation with God, as it is said in <a name="xix.xxvii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004">Ps 130:4</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p13.1"></a> we recumb on him, and hesitate not to flee to him, and to place our salvation in his hand. This is one thing. Then faith brings fear, as it is said in the psalm referred to,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xxvii-p14"></a>“There is propitiation with thee, that thou mayest be feared.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p15"></a>But the Prophet here distinctly refers to these two things; for God, by expressing his will to be known as being merciful, doubtless encourages us to exercise faith, so that we may call on him witIx tranquil minds, and not doubt but he is propitious to us; for he looks not on what we are, in order to repay to us wlmt we deserve, but deals graciously with us according to his <i>mercy: </i>and by saying that he doeth <i>judgment </i>and 			 <i>justice, </i>he intimates, that these two things ought to dispose and turn our hearts to fear and reverence. At the same time, when God declares that he doeth justice, He supplies us with a reason for <i>confidence; </i>for he thus promises to be the guardian of our salvation: for, as I have said, his justice is not to render to every one his just reward, but is to be extended further, and is to be taken for his faithfulness. As then God never forsakes his own people, but aids them in due 			 time, and restrains the wicked, he is on this account called just: we hence can then more securely, and with quieter minds, recumb on him, when we know that his justice is such, that he will never leave us destitute of help whenever necessary.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p16"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>For in these I delight, saith Jehovah</i> This refers to men; as though God had said, that he hated all who pass by the knowledge of his mercy, judgment, and justice, and become ferocious and elated with a vain hope on account of riches, or of strength, or of wisdom, according to what is 			 said in <a name="xix.xxvii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010">Ps 147:10</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p16.1"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xix.xxvii-p17"></a>“The strength of a horse pleases not God, nor is he delighted with the legs of a man;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p18"></a>as though he had said, that God hates that confidence by which men presumptuously extol themselves, while they think their life and their safety to be in their own hand. So also, in this passage, there is a contrast to be understood between the knowledge of God’s mercy, judgment, and justice, and the wisdom, strength, riches, and the foolish glorying, by which men are inflated, when they seek in these their happiness. 			  <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">256</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p22"></a>We now also more clearly see what I have before said, — that not only condemned in these words is the boasting of human power, and the glowing in wisdom and in wealth, but that men are wholly stripped of all the confidence they place in themselves, or seek from the world, in order that the knowledge of God alone may be deemed enough for obtaining perfect happiness. For the Prophet shews, with sufficient clearness, that all men without God 			 are miserable: it hence follows, that they are not otherwise happy but in him. Then the way and manner is to be added. How are we made happy in God? Even by knowing his mercy towards us, and then by delivering up ourselves to his defense and protection, and by suffering ourselves to be ruled by him, and by obeying also his law, because we fear his judgment. This passage might indeed be more fully handled; but it is enough for me, according to my custom, to point out the main things. It now 			 follows —</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxviii-p7"></a><a name="xix.xxviii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p8"></a>The Prophet, after having removed the obstacle which he saw hindered the Jews from reverently receiving the truth of God, now speaks more sharply, and performs the office of a herald in denouncing the vengeance which was at hand: <i>Behold, </i>he says, <i>come shall the days, </i>in which <i>I will visit all the uncircumcised in uncircumcision</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p9"></a>This passage admits of two meanings. Some interpreters take as distinct these two words, <a name="xix.xxviii-p9.1"></a>מול <i>mul, </i>the circumcised, <a name="xix.xxviii-p9.2"></a>בערלה, <i>beorle, 			 </i>in uncircumcision; as though Jeremiah had said, “I will visit the Jews, who are circumcised, as well as the heathen nations, who are uncircumcised,” Others read them jointly, — that God threatens vengeance on the Jews and Gentiles, because they were circumcised, and still retained uncircumcision. The passage may however be thus suitably explained, — that there was a mixture, which corrupted the sacredness of circumcision, and made it like the uncircumcision of the 			 Gentiles; as though it were thus expressed, “I will visit the circumcised with the uncircumcision,” that is, promiscuously and without any difference, as we say in our language, <i>Pele mele. </i>For it follows afterwards, that <i>all were uncircumcised in heart; </i>that is, all the Jews. We 			 hence see that the Prophet makes circumcision and uncireumcision the same, and that he intended to render profane the sacred symbol of adoption;but he had reference to the Jews, who, being degenerated, thus adulterated God’s covenant, and at the same time violated circumcision, so that in differed nothing from <i>uncircumcision. </i>I therefore think, that the Jews are classed with the Gentiles, so that he ascribes even to them uncircumcision: 			 <i>I will </i>then <i>visit all the circumcised with the uncircumcision; </i>that is, the <i>circumcision </i>of each is vain, and is like uncircumcision.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xix.xxviii-p10"></a><a name="xix.xxviii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p11"></a>However this may be, the Prophet here denounces ruin, not only on the Jews, but also on the Egyptians and on other neighboring nations; but he yet speaks to his own people, for his word was not destined for the Egyptians, nor for the Idumeans and the Moabites. But as the Jews were wont to have recourse to the Egyptians, when any danger arose from the Assyrians and Chaldeans, the Prophet here connects the Egyptians with 			 the Jews, and for the same reason, the other nations. We indeed know that the Idumeans and the Moabites were most hostile enemies to the Jews; but as the state of things changed, they were at one time their enemies, at another their friends; and when they saw that the Chaldeans extended their power, they saw also that they were exposed to plunder, and hence it happened that they willingly helped the Jews. Since then the Hebrews hoped that their neighbors on every side would aid them, the 			 Prophet says that a visitation was nigh them all: and hence is confirmed what I have already said; for he distinguishes not the Jews from the Egyptians and other nations; but, on the contrary, as they had made alliances with them, he intends to unite them in one body: <i>I will visit, </i>he says, <i>the circumcised with the 			 uncircumcision</i> For the Jews did not bear in mind that God was the protector of their safety, and that they had been set apart by him from other nations. He names the circumcised together with the uncircumcision, because the Egyptians, the Idumeans, the Ammonites, and the Moabites, were deemed circumcised on account of the covenant they had made with the Jews; and the Jews were deemed uncircumcised, because they had forsaken God, and 			 thus profarted themselves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p12"></a>It is indeed true that the Idumeans were circumcised, for they were the descendants of Esau, and had no doubt retained this external symbol; but their circumcision was altogether a mockery, as Esau had departed from the Church of God. The circumcision of the elect people was in itself efficacious; but as they had alike fallen into superstitions, they were like the uncircumcised, according to what Paul says, — that the 			 letter of the circumcision, that is, the external rite, was nothing. We hence see that there is no common propriety in the Prophet’s words, when he denounces vengeance on the Jews as well as on the Egyptians, and names the circumcised with the uneircumcision; for the latter had uncircumcision, the former circumcision, and thus they had blended profane and sacred things together, so that there was nothing pure or uncorrupted: and hence he mentions <i>Egypt, Judah, Edom, </i>the <i>children of Ammon, </i>and <i>Moab</i> We have before stated why he enumerated all these nations; he did so, because they expected help from one another, so that they all despised God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p13"></a>He afterwards adds, <i>And all the extreme ones in a corner</i> The word <a name="xix.xxviii-p13.1"></a>קף, <i>kots, </i>means the end; hence they take <a name="xix.xxviii-p13.2"></a>קצוצים, <i>kotsutsim, </i>here for extremities: and <a name="xix.xxviii-p13.3"></a>פאה <i>pae, </i>signifies a corner, and an end. We might then, if propriety of language would bear it, render the words thus, “the cornered in the corner.” But the meaning is 			 by no means ambiguous, which is, that though the Moabites and others had hidden recesses, they could not be exempt from the calamity. God’s vengeance shall come, says Jeremiah, into their farthest corners, where they think that they dwell in safety. And what follows is explanatory, <i>the inhabitants of the wilderness, </i>or, those who dwell in the wilderness. He thus shews what he 			 meant by <a name="xix.xxviii-p13.4"></a>קצוצי פאה <i>kotsutsi pae, </i>the extremities, of the corner. For when people inhabit remote places, they regard themselves on that account safer, being secure in their hiding — places: this confidence the Prophet derides; and he says that punishment would <i>reach </i>them also.  			  <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">257</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p19"></a>He then adds, <i>For all the nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart</i> By saying, that <i>all nations </i>were uncircumcised, he doubtless includes the Israelites, and thus by way of reproach he takes away from the chosen 			 people their peculiar distinction; as though he had said, that Israel was so mixed with the nations, that they only made a part of them: the Jews would have otherwise denied, that they deserved to be classed with the Gentiles; but the Prophet deprives them of every excuse, and says that they were but one nation, having no difference: <i>All these nations </i>then <i>are uncircumcised</i> And so <a name="xix.xxviii-p19.1"></a>ה <i>He, </i>before <a name="xix.xxviii-p19.2"></a>גוים <i>guim, </i>nations, may be taken as a demonstrative pronoun, and 			 not a relative, “All these nations.” He had spoken not only of the Egyptians and the Idumeans and of other neighboring nations, but had also mentioned Judah. He then says, “All these nations are uncircumcised:” and as I have already said, he condemns Israel, because they differed nothing from the nations, though God had consecrated them to himself; for there was an entire mingling, which made them all equal.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p20"></a>But as some objection might still be alleged, he says, the Jews are <i>uncircumcised in heart</i> He had indeed already included them in the nations; but it was necessary to insist more on this point, for circumcision might have been pleaded by them. Hence the Prophet says, that though they had the visible 			 symbol in the flesh, they were yet uncircumcised in heart, and ought therefore to be classed with the nations. We see how sharply he reproves them: though he separates them from other nations, he yet shews that they justly deserved to be numbered with them; for God cares not for the external symbol, but regards the chief thing, the circumcision of the heart.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p21"></a>It is a common thing with Moses and the Prophets to call an unrenewed heart, uncircumcision, and to say that the people are <i>uncircumcised </i>in heart: for circumcision, while an evidence of free salvation in Christ, at the same time initiated the Jews into the worship and service of God, and proved the necessity of a new life; it was in short a sign both of repentance and of faith. When, therefore, the Jews presented only the sign, 			 they were justly derided by Moses and the prophets; for they seemed as though they sought to pacify God by a thing of nought, without regarding the end. The same is the case now when we boast of baptism alone, and are at the same time destitute of repentance and faith: our boasting is absurd and ridiculous. And hence Paul calls the external rite, when the sign is separated from its reality and substance, the letter of the circumcision; and on the other hand he calls that the true circumcision, 			 which is in secret and in the spirit. We may also say the same of baptism, — that the literal baptism avails hypocrites nothing, for they receive only the naked sign: and therefore we must come to the spirit of baptism, to the thing itself; for the interior power is renovation, when our old man is crucified in us, and when we rise again with Christ into newness of life.</p>  <a name="xix.xxix"></a>  		  
 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="xix.xxix-p1"></a>PRAYER</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xix.xxix-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast revealed to us in thy Gospel how guilty and miserable we are, we may learn to loathe ourselves, ard so He down confounded and despairing on account of the sins and guilt we have contracted, as yet to know that true glory is offered to us, and that we can be made partakers of it, if by true faith we embrace thy only-begotten Son, in whom is offered to us perfect righteousness and salvation: And grant also that we 			 may so cleave to Christ, and so receive by faith his blessings, that we may be able, not only before the world, but also against Satan and death itself, to glory in thee, that thou alone art just and wise and strong; and may thy strength and justice and wisdom shine forth upon us in our iniquity and ignorance and infirmity, until we shall at length reach that ruiness of glory, which has been prepared for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. — Amen.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.i-p8"></a> This verse is connected by some with the last chapter: and it seems to belong to it. It forms in all the Hebrew MSS. the 23d verse of the preceding chapter. The phrase, <a name="xix.i-p8.1"></a>מי-יתן, “who will give,” means a wish, “O that my head,” etc., or “May my head,” etc. The <i>Septuagint, </i>the <i>Vulgate, </i>the <i>Arabic, </i>and the <i>Targum </i>express it literally, “Who will give;” but the <i>Syriac </i>has, “O, I wish my head were turned into water.” — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.ii-p10"></a> This verse may be rendered thus, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p11"></a>O that I, had in the desert the lodging of travellers, Then I would go away from them; For all of them <i>are </i>adulterers, A company of hypocrites.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.ii-p12"></a>He preferred living in the temporary sheds of travellers, erected in the desert, rather than to live among his own people. How intolerably wicked they must have been! A company, or an assembly, a multitude: the word need not be deemed as retaining its primary idea. The meaning is, that the whole community, the whole people, were hypocrites; they pretended to worship and serve God, and at the same time were idolaters and treacherous and immoral 				  in their conduct. The word for “hypocrites” is derived from one that means a garment, a cloak, a covering; and the verb means to act under a cover, to act deceitfully, or falsely, or hypocritically, or perfidiously. It is rendered “deceivers” by the <i>Septuagint, </i>“prevaricators” by the <i>Vulgate, </i>“liars” by the <i>Syriac, </i>“falsifiers” by the <i>Targum, </i>and “perfidious dealers” by <i>Blayney.</i> — <i>Ed.</i></p>

Blayney </i>makes a conjectural emendation, and <i>Houbigant </i>and <i>Horsley </i>make another; but neither is necessary. The literal version is as follows, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.v-p10"></a>And they bend their tongue, their lying bow; And not for truth are they strong in the land.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.v-p11"></a>“Their lying bow,” or “their bow of falsehood;” it was a bow by which they shot lies; they employed their tongues for this purpose. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.vii-p10"></a> The whole verse may he thus rendered, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p11"></a>And they deceive, every one his neighbor, And the truth they speak not; They have taught their tongue the word of falsehood; <i>With </i>perverting have they wearied themselves.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.vii-p12"></a>The verb for “deceive” means to mock, to trifle with, to play the fool with. Their object was to befool their neighbors by cheating and deceiving them. “The word,” or the matter, “of falsehood,” is falsehood itself, or sheer falsehood. The <i>Vulgate </i>and the <i>Syriac’s </i>version is, “They have taught their tongue to speak falsehood.” To teach the tongue false-hood, was to habituate it to tell lies. The last line is differently rendered. 				  The <i>Septuagint </i>deviates far from the original. The version of the <i>Vulgate </i>is, “They have labored to act unjustly;” and this comes near the meaning; only “to act unjustly” is rather to act pervertingly: they wrested and turned everything from its right course and meaning; and they labored in perverting things, until they wearied themselves. Falsehood requires more labor than truth. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.viii-p13"></a> <i>Houbigant, Horsley, </i>and <i>Venema </i>have suggested emendations as to this verse, derived in some measure from the <i>Septuagint. </i>A part of the first word, <a name="xix.viii-p13.1"></a>שבתך, is connected by 				  the <i>Septuagint </i>with the former verse; for it is divided into <a name="xix.viii-p13.2"></a>שב and <a name="xix.viii-p13.3"></a>תך As to this division the preceding authors agree; but they differ as to the construction, though mainly the same in sense. The most probable is that of 				  <i>Venema, </i>for he only divides the word, and gives this version,</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p14"></a>Burst forth does robbery upon robbery, deceit, on deceit; <br> 				  They refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p15"></a>Burst forth, or <i>boil </i>— <a name="xix.viii-p15.1"></a><i>exoestuat</i><i>, </i>is certainly not the meaning of <a name="xix.viii-p15.2"></a>שב which signifies to return, to turn, to 				  restore, etc. Then the rendering would be,</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p16"></a>Return does guile for guile, deceit for deceit.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p17"></a>The first word is rendered “usury — <a name="xix.viii-p17.1"></a>τόκος” by the <i>Septuagint, </i>but <a name="xix.viii-p17.2"></a>תך means guile or fraud. See <a name="xix.viii-p17.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007">Ps 10:7</a><a name="xix.viii-p17.3"></a>; <a name="xix.viii-p17.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012">Ps 55:12</a><a name="xix.viii-p17.4"></a>; <a name="xix.viii-p17.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014">Ps 72:14</a><a name="xix.viii-p17.5"></a>. The meaning is, that their dishonest dealings were reciprocal: the cheats cheated one another.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.viii-p18"></a>Our version agrees with the <i>Vulgate </i>and the <i>Syriac, </i>and is adopted by <i>Blayney: </i>and he concludes from the end of this verse, that the speaker from the 2d verse is not the Prophet, but God; who, adopting the language of man, intimates his wish to leave a people so wicked. But this conclusion is not necessary; for the prophets often introduce sentences of this kind. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="xix.xiv-p17"></a>The “pleasant places” were “desolate;” and “in the mountains” no “voice of cattle” was heard. No one “passing through” explains the desolation.

 <p><a name="xix.xvi-p14"></a>The wise man is the same with him to whom God had spoken: and what he had to understand and to declare was the reason why the land was destroyed. Then in the next verse God himself, by the mouth of his prophet, makes this known. “Made waste” is rendered “burnt up” by the<i>Septuagint</i> and the <i>Vulgate, </i>but desolated, or desolate, by the <i>Targum, Syriac, </i>and <i>Arabic; </i>and no doubt rightly, as “without a 				  traveler,” or one passing through, explains what is meant: in like manner, “without an inhabitant,” in the preceding verse, is an explanation of “the cities of Judah” being made “desolate,” or rather, entirely desolate. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>

Be it so, says the Prophet, yet death will enter, if not through the gates, yet through the windows, and through our towers, and it will destroy the children who play in our streets, and our 				  young men assembled in the squares and the wide places of our city. That those collected at Jerusalem are here meant, is evident from the nineteenth verse. Then, in the next verse, he refers to those who still continued in the country. And this accounts for the change made in the sentence, which has puzzled some expounders, and induced them to propose emendations. The verse may be thus rendered, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxiii-p17"></a>For climbed has death through our windows, It has come through our towers, <br> 				  To cut off the child from the street, The young men from the broad streets.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.xxvii-p19"></a> <i>Blayney </i>and <i>Venema </i>agree with <i>Calvin </i>in thinking that “these” refer to such men as knew God and trusted in him, and not to “these” things, the mercy, judgment, and justice before mentioned. The versions and the <i>Targum </i>are ambiguous, like the Hebrew, except the <i>Vulgate, </i>in which “these” is in the neuter gender, referring to things, and not to men. I would render the verse thus, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p20"></a>But in this let him glory who glories, That he understands, and that he knows me, — That I am Jehovah, Who doeth mercy, judgment, and justice in the land; For in these have I delighted, saith Jehovah.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxvii-p21"></a>“Me” is left out in the <i>Septuagint, </i>the <i>Syriac, </i>and the <i>Arabic. </i>“That he knows me” is only a more clear enunciation of the previous words, “that he understands:” what he understands or knows is then stated, “That I am,” etc. “Judgment,” when connected with justice, seems to refer to what the law forbids; and “justice,” to what the law enjoins. See 				  <a name="xix.xxvii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001">Isa 56:1</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p21.1"></a>, where the command is, to “keep” or observe “judgment,” and to “do” or execute “justice.” God doeth judgment in that he doeth nothing wrong, contrary to what is right and just; and he doeth justice in the defence of what is right and just, and in making good what he hath promised. Judgment regards the negative part of the law, and justice the active part. In 				  <a name="xix.xxvii-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003">Jer 22:3</a><a name="xix.xxvii-p21.2"></a>, we find both words, “judgment and justice,” or righteousness. Then, as it is usual with the prophets, the last is described first, “delivered is the spoiled:” afterwards judgment is set forth, it does “no wrong,” etc. But it is only when the two words occur together that they have these specific meanings; for both, occurring separately, have a much wider import. They are used together more 				  than twenty times. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xix.xxviii-p14"></a> The exposition of the phrase given in this section is inconsistent with all the ancient versions and the <i>Targum: </i>it is what has been given by modern rabbins. “The shaven around the face,” is the <i>Septuagint; </i>“the shaven as to the hair,” the <i>Vulqate 				  </i>and the <i>Targum; </i>and to the same purpose is the <i>Syriac </i>and <i>Arabic. </i>The word <a name="xix.xxviii-p14.2"></a>פאה is used in <a name="xix.xxviii-p14.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027">Le 19:27</a><a name="xix.xxviii-p14.3"></a>, with distinct reference to the <i>side </i>or <i>corner </i>of the head, and of the beard; and the Israelites were forbidden to imitate the nations who shaved off those parts. <i>Parkhurst </i>renders the phrase (which occurs also in <a name="xix.xxviii-p14.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023">Jer 25:23</a><a name="xix.xxviii-p14.4"></a>, and in <a name="xix.xxviii-p14.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032">Jer 49:32</a><a name="xix.xxviii-p14.5"></a>) “trimmed on the sides,” that is, of the head; more literally, “the shaven on the side,” that is, of the head, or, “on the corner,” that is, of the beard. It was a phrase, though defective, yet no doubt well understood, as it is the case in other languages. The design of mentioning these 				  seems to have been to class together such as had been expressly separated. I propose the following as the version of the two verses, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p15"></a><b>25.</b> Behold the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will visit every one circumcised, <i>Who is </i>in uncircumcision, —</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p16"></a><b>26. </b>The Egyptians and Judah, Edom also and the children of Ammon and Moab, And all the shawn on the side <i>of the head, </i>Who dwell in the desert; For all these nations are uncircumcised; And all the house of Israel, — <i>They are </i>uncircumcised in heart.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xix.xxviii-p17"></a>It is justly remarked by <i>Horsley </i>that the nations here mentioned practiced circumcision. They were hence circumcised, and yet in uncircumcision; and the Jews were like them: and the last line explains this apparent contradiction: they had the outward but not the inward circumcision. — <i>Ed.</i></p>
