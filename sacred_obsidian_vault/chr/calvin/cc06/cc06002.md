 <p><a name="ii.i-p5"></a><b>7.</b> Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Arnorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="ii.i-p6"></a><b>7.</b> Vertite vos, et proficiscimini, et ite ad montem Amorrhmorum, et ad omnes vicinos ejus, in solitudine, in monte, et planitie, et rueridle, et in littore marls, terrain Chenanaei a Lebanon usque ad flumen magnum flumen Euphraten.</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="ii.i-p7"></a><b>8.</b> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord. swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them, and to their seed after them.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="ii.i-p8"></a><b>8.</b> Vide, dedi coram vobis terram, ingredimini, et possidete terram illam quam juravit Jehova patribus vestris, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, se daturum eis, et semini eorum post ipsos.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.i-p10"></a><b>6.</b> <i>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb.</i> In this Second Narration, Moses expressly declares that God not only gave them a visible sign, by uplifting the cloud, but that He also verbally commanded the people to leave Mount Sinai, and to set about the performance of the rest of their 			 journey. God says, then, that enough time had been spent in one place;   			  <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a>
  			  for, before they left it, an entire year had passed away there. Although there were eleven days’ journey before them before they would arrive at Kadesh-barnea, nevertheless, lest anything should delay the people, who were naturally but too indolent, tie stimulates them by setting before them the ease with which it might be accomplished, telling them that they had but to lift up their feet and advance, in order to attain the promised rest.</p>
