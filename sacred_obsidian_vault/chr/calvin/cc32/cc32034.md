 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p10"></a>The leading object of this parable is, to show that we ought to deal kindly and generously with our neighbors; that, when we come to the judgment seat of God, we may reap the fruit of our liberality. Though the parable appears to be harsh and far-fetched, yet the conclusion makes it evident, that the design of Christ was nothing else than what I have stated. And hence we see, that to inquire with great exactness into every minute part of a 			 parable is an absurd mode of philosophizing. Christ does not advise us to purchase by large donations the forgiveness of fraud, and of extortion, and of wasteful expenditure, and of the other crimes associated with unfaithful administration. But as all the blessings which God confers upon us are committed by Him to our administration, our Lord now lays down a method of procedure, which will protect us against being treated with rigor, when we come to render our account.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p11"></a>They who imagine that alms are a sufficient compensation for sensuality and debauchery, do not sufficiently consider, that the first injunction given us is, to live in sobriety and temperance; and that the next is, that the streams which flow to us come from a pure fountain. It is certain that no man is so frugal, as not sometimes to waste the property which has been entrusted to him; and that even those who practice the most rigid economy 			 are not entirely free from the charge of unfaithful <i>stewardship. </i>Add to this, that there are so many ways of abusing the gifts of God, that some incur guilt in one way, and some in another. I do not even deny, that the very consciousness of our own faulty <i>stewardship </i>ought to be felt by us as an additional excitement to kind actions.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p12"></a>But we ought to have quite another object in view, than to escape the judgment of God by paying a price for our redemption; and that object is, first, that seasonable and well-judged liberality may have the effect of restraining and moderating unnecessary expenses; and, secondly, that our kindness to our brethren may draw down upon us the mercy of God. It is very far from being the intention of Christ to point out to his disciples a way of 			 escape, when the heavenly Judge shall require them to give their account; but he warns them to lose no time in guarding against the punishment which will await their cruelty, if they are found to have swallowed up the gifts of God, and to have paid no attention to acts of beneficence.  			  <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">297</font></a>
  			 We must always attend to this maxim, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p14"></a>with what measure a man measures, it shall be recompensed to him again, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.xxxiii-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002">Mt 7:2</a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p14.2"></a>.)</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p16"></a><b>8. </b><i>And the master commended the unjust steward</i> Here it is obvious that if we were to attempt to find a meaning for every minute circumstance, we would act absurdly. To make donations out of what belongs to another man, is an action which is very far from deserving applause; and who would patiently endure 			 that an unprincipled villain should rob him of his property, and give it away according to his own fancy? It were indeed the grossest stupidity, if that man who beheld a portion of his substance taken away, should <i>commend</i> the person who stole the remainder of it and bestowed it on others. But Christ only meant what he adds a little afterwards, that ungodly and worldly men are 			 more industrious and skillful in conducting the affairs of this fading life, than the children of God are anxious to obtain the heavenly and eternal life, or careful to make it the subject of their study and meditation.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p17"></a>By this comparison he charges us with highly criminal indifference, in not providing for the future, with at least as much earnestness as ungodly men display by attending to their own interests in this world. How disgraceful is it that <i>the children of light,</i> whom God enlightens by his Spirit and word, 			 should slumber and neglect the hope of eternal blessedness held out to them, while worldly men are so eagerly bent on their own accommodations, and so provident and sagacious! Hence we infer, that our Lord does not intend to compare the wisdom of the Spirit to the wisdom of the flesh, (which could not have been done without pouring contempt on God himself,) but only to arouse believers to consider more attentively what belongs to the future life, and not to shut their eyes against the light of 			 the Gospel, when they perceive that even the blind, amidst their darkness, see more clearly. And, indeed, <i>the children of light</i> ought to be more powerfully excited, when they behold <i>the</i> <i>children of this 			 world</i> making provision against a distant period, for a life which is fading, and which passes in a moment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxiii-p18"></a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p19"></a><b>9. </b><i>Make to yourselves friends.</i> As in the words which were last considered Christ did not enjoin us to offer sacrifices to God out of the fruits of extortion, so now he does not mean that we ought to search for defenders or advocates, who will throw around us the shield of their protection; but teaches us 			 that by acts of charity we obtain favor with God, who has promised, that <i>to the merciful he will show himself merciful, </i>(<a name="ii.xxxiii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025">Ps 18:25</a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p19.1"></a>.) It is highly foolish and absurd to infer from this passage, that the prayers or approbation of the dead are of service to us: for, on that supposition, all that is bestowed on unworthy persons would be 			 thrown away; but the depravity of men does not prevent the Lord from placing on his records all that we have expended on the poor. The Lord looks not to the persons, but to the work itself, so that our liberality, though it may happen to be exercised towards ungrateful men, will be of avail to us in the sight of God. But then he appears to intimate that eternal life depends on our merits. I reply: it is sufficiently plain from the context that he speaks after the manner of men. One who 			 possesses extensive influence or wealth, if he procure friends during his prosperity, has persons who will support him when he is visited by adversity. In like manner, our kindness to the poor will be a seasonable relief to us; for whatever any man may have generously bestowed on his neighbors the Lord acknowledges as if it had been done to himself.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p20"></a><i>When you fail.</i> By this word he expresses the time of death, and reminds us that the time of our administration will be short, lest the confident expectation of a longer continuance of life should make us take a firmer grasp. The greater part are sunk in slumber through their wealth; many squander what they have on superfluities; 			 while the niggardliness of others keeps it back, and deprives both themselves and others of the benefit. Whence comes all this, but because they are led astray by an unfounded expectation of long life, and give themselves up to every kind of indulgence?</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p21"></a><i>Of the mammon of unrighteousness.</i> By giving this name to riches, he intends to render them an object of our suspicion, because for the most part they involve their possessors in <i>unrighteousness</i> Though in 			 themselves they are not evil, yet as it rarely happens that they are obtained without deceit, or violence, or some other unlawful expedient, or that the enjoyment of them is unaccompanied by pride, or luxury, or some other wicked disposition, Christ justly represents them as worthy of our suspicion; just as on another occasion he called them <i>thorns, </i>(<a name="ii.xxxiii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007">Matt. 13:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022">22</a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p21.1"></a>.) It would appear that a contrast, though not expressed, is intended to be supplied, to this effect; that riches, which otherwise, in consequence of wicked abuse, polluted their possessors, and are almost in every ease allurements of sin, ought to be directed to a contrary object, to be the means of procuring favor for us. Let us also remember what I have formerly stated, that God does not demand sacrifice to be made from booty 			 unjustly acquired, as if he were the partner of thieves, and that it is rather a warning given to believers to keep themselves free from <i>unrighteousness</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxiii-p22"></a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p23"></a><b>10. </b><i>He who is faithful in that which is least.</i> Those maxims are proverbs taken from ordinary practice and experience, and it is quite enough if they are generally true. It will sometimes happen, no doubt, that a deceiver, who had disregarded a small gain, shall display his wickedness in a matter of 			 importance. Nay, many persons, by affecting honesty in trifling matters, are only in pursuit of an enormous gain;   			  <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">298</font></a>
  			  as that author   			  <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">299</font></a>
  			  says: “Fraud establishes confidence in itself in small matters, that, when a fit opportunity shall arrive, it may deceive with vast advantage.” And yet the statement of Christ is not inaccurate; for in proverbs, as I have mentioned, we attend only to what usually happens.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p26"></a>Christ, therefore, exhorts his disciples to act faithfully in small matters, in order to prepare themselves for the exercise of fidelity in matters of the highest importance. He next applies this doctrine to the proper <i>stewardship </i>of spiritual graces, which the world, indeed, does not estimate according to their value, but which far surpass, beyond all question, the fading riches of this world. Those persons, he tells us, who act 			 improperly and unfaithfully in things of small value, such as the transitory riches of the world, do not deserve that God should entrust to them the inestimable treasure of the Gospel, and of similar gifts. There is, therefore, in these words an implied threatening, that there is reason to fear lest, on account of our abuse of an earthly <i>stewardship, </i>we fail to obtain heavenly gifts. In this sense, <i>what is true </i>is contrasted with <i>riches, </i>as what is solid and lasting is 			 contrasted with what is shadowy and fading.  			  <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">300</font></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p29"></a><b>12. </b><i>And if you have not been faithful in what belongs to another.</i> By the expression, <i>what belongs to another,</i> he means what is not within man; for God does not bestow riches upon us on 			 condition that we shall be attached to them, but makes us <i>stewards</i> of them in such a manner, that they may not bind us with their chains. And, indeed, it is impossible that our minds should be free and disengaged for dwelling in heaven, if we did not look upon every thing that is in the world as <i>belonging to 			 another</i></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p30"></a><i>Who shall entrust to you what is your own?</i> Spiritual riches, on the other hand, which relate to a future life, are pronounced by him to be <i>our own, </i>because the enjoyment of them is everlasting. But now he employs a different comparison. There is no reason, he tells us, to expect 			 that we shall make a proper and moderate use of <i>our own </i>property, if we have acted improperly or unfaithfully in <i>what belonged to another.</i> Men usually care less about abusing, and allow themselves greater liberty in squandering, <i>their own </i>property, because they are not afraid 			 that any person will find fault with them; but when a thing has been entrusted to them either in charge or in loan, and of which they must afterwards render an account, they are more cautious and more timid.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p31"></a>We thus ascertain Christ’s meaning to be, that they who are bad <i>stewards </i>of earthly blessings would not be faithful guardians of spiritual gifts. He next introduces a sentence: <i>You cannot serve God and mammon; </i>which I have explained at <a name="ii.xxxiii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mt 6:24</a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p31.1"></a>. There the reader will find an explanation of the word <i>Mammon</i>    			  <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">301</font></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p34"></a><b>14. </b><i>And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things. They</i> who imagine that Christ was <i>ridiculed by the Pharisees, </i>because he chose to employ a plain and familiar style, and made no use of swelling words,   			  <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">302</font></a>
  			  do not sufficiently comprehend what Luke means. Haughty and disdainful men, I do acknowledge, view the doctrine of the Gospel with contempt; but Luke expressly declares the reason why Christ was the object of their derision to have been, that they <i>were covetous</i> Entertaining a firm and deep-seated conviction that the rich are happy, and that there 			 is nothing better for men than to increase their wealth by every possible method, and earnestly to guard whatever they have acquired, they reject as foolish paradoxes   			  <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">303</font></a>
  			  all the sayings of Christ which had a contrary tendency. And, certainly, any one that speaks of despising riches, or bestowing alms on the poor, is regarded by the <i>covetous </i>as a madman. Horace’s words on this subject are well known:   			  <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">304</font></a>
  			  “The people hiss at me, but I am well satisfied with myself.”   			  <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">305</font></a>
  			  But if, even when they are condemned by universal opinion, they continue to flatter themselves, how much more will they ridicule as a fable that philosophy of Christ which is far removed from the ordinary belief?</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p39"></a>Some other pretense, I have no doubt, was held out by the Pharisees for ridiculing and evading a doctrine which opposed their vice. But we must attend to the motive by which they were actuated; for it is a disease which almost always prevails in the world, that the greater part of men affect to despise whatever does not fall in with their corrupt morals. Hence the ridicule, and jest, and merriment, with which the word of God is frequently 			 assailed; for every man fights in defense of his own vices, and all imagine that their witticisms will serve for a cloud to screen their criminality.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxxiii-p40"></a><a name="ii.xxxiii-p40.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p41"></a><b>15. </b><i>It is you that justify yourselves before men.</i> We see that Christ does not give way to their disdainful conduct, but constantly maintains the authority of his doctrine in opposition to their mockery; and it is the duty of all the ministers of the Gospel to pursue the same course, by meeting ungodly 			 despisers with the dreadful judgment of God. He declares that the hypocrisy, with which they deceive the eyes of men, will be of no avail to them at the judgment-seat of God. They were unwilling to have it thought that their mockery was intended as a defense of their <i>covetousness. </i>But Christ affirms that this venom breaks out from a concealed ulcer; just as if one were to tell the mitred prelates of our own day, that their hostility to the 			 Gospel arises from the severity with which it attacks their hidden vices.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p42"></a><i>But God knoweth your hearts.</i> He says that they reckon it enough if they appear to be good in the eyes of men, and if they can boast of a pretended sanctity; but that <i>God, who knoweth the hearts,</i> is well 			 acquainted with the vices which they conceal from the view of the world. And here we must attend to the distinction between the judgments of God and the judgments of men; for men bestow approbation on outward appearances, but at the judgment-seat of God nothing is approved but an upright heart. There is added a striking observation:</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxiii-p43"></a><i>What is highly esteemed by men is abomination in the sight of God.</i> Not that God rejects those virtues, the approbation of which He hath engraved on the hearts of men; but that God detests whatever men are disposed, of their own accord, to applaud. Hence it is evident in what light we ought to view all pretended acts of worship 			 which the world contrives according to its own fancy. How much soever they may please their inventors, Christ pronounces that they are not only vain and worthless, but are even detestable.</p>
