There were two mistakes; first, that 			 they pictured to themselves rest and happiness without the cross; secondly, that they judged of <i>the kingdom of God </i>according to their own carnal sense. Hence it appears how slight and obscure their faith was; for though they had entertained a hope of the resurrection, yet the taste was too slight for forming a fixed and decided opinion about Christ. They believe him to be the Redeemer who had been formerly promised, and hence they conceive a 			 hope that the Church will be renewed; but that knowledge immediately degenerates into vain imaginations, which either overturn or obscure the power of his kingdom. But the strangest thing of all was, that so many warnings should have passed away from their recollection without yielding any advantage. At least, it was brutal stupidity that, though Christ had lately declared, in express terms, that he was just about to undergo a bitter and ignominious death, they not only remained unconcerned, 			 but rushed forward, as if to a joyful triumph.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p14"></a><b>12.</b> <i>A certain nobleman. Matthew </i>interweaves this parable with others, without attending to the order of time; but, as his intention was, in the twenty-second chapter, to make a collection of Christ’s latest discourses, readers ought not to trouble themselves greatly with the inquiry 			 which of them was delivered on the first, or the second, or the third day within that short period. But it is proper to observe the difference between <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke; </i>for, while the former touches only on one point, the latter embraces two. This point is common to both, that Christ resembles <i>a nobleman</i>, who, undertaking a <i>long journey </i>for the sake of <i>obtaining a kingdom</i>, has entrusted his <i>money </i>to the management of <i>his servants</i>, and so on. The other point is peculiar to Luke, that the 			 subjects abused the absence of the prince, and raised a tumult in order to shake off his yoke. In both parts Christ intended to show, that the disciples were greatly mistaken in supposing that his royal authority was already established, and that he was coming <i>to Jerusalem</i>, in order to commence immediately a course of prosperity. Thus by taking away the expectation of an immediate <i>kin</i>g<i>dom</i>, he exhorts them to hope and patience; for he tells them that they must long and steadily endure many toils, before they enjoy that glory for which they pant too earnestly.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p15"></a><i>Into a distant country.</i> As the disciples thought that Christ was now about to enter into the possession of his kingdom, he first corrects this mistake by informing them, that he must undertake a<i> long journey</i>, in order <i>to obtain the kingdom</i>    			  <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">686</font></a>
  			  As to what is meant by the <i>distant country</i>,<i> I </i>leave it to the ingenious expositions of those who are fond of subtleties. For my own part, I think that Christ expresses nothing more than his long absence, which would extend from the time of his death to his last coming. For, though he sits at the right hand of the Father, and holds the 			 government of heaven and earth, and though, from the time that he ascended to heaven, <i>all power was given to him</i>, (<a name="ii.lxxix-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018">Mt 28:18</a><a name="ii.lxxix-p16.2"></a>,) <i>that every knee might bow before him</i>, (<a name="ii.lxxix-p16.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Php 2:10</a><a name="ii.lxxix-p16.3"></a>;) yet as he has not yet subdued his enemies — has not yet appeared as Judge of the world, or revealed his majesty — it is not without propriety that he is said to be absent from his people, till he return again, clothed with his new sovereignty. It is true, indeed, that he now reigns, while he regenerates his people to the heavenly life, forms them anew to the image of God, and 			 associates them with angels; while he governs the Church by his word, guards it by his protection, enriches it with the gifts of the Spirit, nourishes it by his grace, and maintains it by his power, and, in short, supplies it with all that is necessary for salvation; while he restrains the fury of Satan and of all the ungodly, and defeats all their schemes. But as this way of reigning is concealed from the flesh, his manifestation is properly said to be delayed till the last day. Since, 			 therefore, the apostles foolishly aimed at the shadow of a kingdom, our Lord declares that he must go to seek a <i>distant </i>kingdom, that, they may learn to endure delay.   			  <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">687</font></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p19"></a><b>13.</b> <i>And having called his ten servants.</i> We must not inquire anxiously into the number of the servants, or into the sums of money. For Matthew, by expressing various sums, includes a more extensive doctrine, namely, that Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but 			 commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of money. Both agree in this, that till the last day of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and do no good; for each has a certain office enjoined him, in which he ought to be employed, and, therefore, they ought to be diligent in <i>trading</i>, that they may be careful to increase their Lord’s property.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p20"></a>Luke says simply, that to each he gave <i>a pound; </i>because, whether more or less may be committed to us by our Lord, every man must equally give account for himself. Matthew, as I have said, is more full and copious; for he states various degrees. Let us know that the Lord does not bestow on all indiscriminately the same <i>measure of gifts</i>, (<a name="ii.lxxix-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007">Eph 4:7</a><a name="ii.lxxix-p20.1"></a>,) but</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxxix-p21"></a>distributes them variously as he thinks proper, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxxix-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011">1Co 12:11</a><a name="ii.lxxix-p21.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p22"></a> so that some excel others. But whatever gifts the Lord has bestowed upon us, let us know that it is committed to us as so much money, that it may yield some gain; for nothing could be more unreasonable than that we should allow to remain buried, or should apply to no use, God’s favors, the value of which consists in yielding fruit.</p>

  			  which ought not to be acknowledged as having been received from God; and, therefore, whoever shall determine to give God his share will leave nothing for himself. What then is meant by saying, that the master of the house gives to each person more or less, <i>according to his own ability? </i>It is because God, as he has assigned to every one his place, and 			 has bestowed on him natural gifts, gives him also this or the other injunction, employs him in the management of affairs, raises him to various offices, furnishes him with abundant means of eminent usefulness, and presents to him the opportunity.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.lxxix-p26"></a><a name="ii.lxxix-p26.1"></a>It is absurd, however, in the Papists to infer from this, that the gifts of God are conferred on every man according to the measure which he deserves. For, though the old translator,   			  <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">689</font></a>
  			 <a name="ii.lxxix-p27.2"></a> employed the word <i>virtus</i><a name="ii.lxxix-p27.3"></a>,   			  <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">690</font></a>
  			  <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.5"></a>he did not mean that God bestows his gifts, according as men have acquitted themselves well, and obtained the praise of <i>virtue</i><a name="ii.lxxix-p28.6"></a>, <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.7"></a>but only so far as the master of the house has judged them to be suitable. Now we know that no man is found by God to be suitable till He has made him so; and the Greek word <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.8"></a>δύναμις<a name="ii.lxxix-p28.9"></a>,<i> (power</i><a name="ii.lxxix-p28.10"></a>,<i> ability</i><a name="ii.lxxix-p28.11"></a>,<i>) </i><a name="ii.lxxix-p28.12"></a>which Christ employed, is free from all ambiguity.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lxxix-p29"></a><a name="ii.lxxix-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p30"></a><b>20.</b> <i>And he who had received five talents.</i> Those who employ usefully whatever God has committed to them are said to be engaged in <i>trading</i>  The life of the 			 godly,   			  <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">691</font></a>
  			  is justly compared to <i>trading</i>, for they ought naturally to exchange and barter with each other, in order to maintain intercourse; and the industry with which every mall discharges the office assigned him, the calling itself, the power of acting properly, and other gifts, are reckoned to be so many kinds of <i>merchandise; </i>because the use or object which they have in view is, to promote mutual intercourse among men.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxxix-p32"></a>Now the gain which Christ mentions is general usefulness,  			  <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">692</font></a>
  			 which illustrates the glory of God. For, though God is not enriched, and makes no <i>gain</i>, by our labors, yet when every one is highly profitable to his brethren, and applies advantageously, for their salvation, the gifts which he has received from God, he is said to yield <i>profit</i>, or <i>gain</i>, to God himself. So highly does our heavenly Father value the salvation of men, that whatever contributes to it he chooses to place to his own account. That we 			 may not <i>become weary in doing well</i>, (<a name="ii.lxxix-p33.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009">Ga 6:9</a><a name="ii.lxxix-p33.2"></a>,) Christ declares that the labor of those who are faithfully employed in their calling will not be useless.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p34"></a>According to <i>Luke</i>, he says that <i>he who gained five pounds obtains the government of five cities;</i> by which words he informs them, that the glory of his kingdom will be very different at his last coming from 			 what it now appears. For now   			  <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">693</font></a>
  			  we have labor and anxiety in managing, as it were, the affairs of an absent master; but then he will have at his command an ample and copious supply of honors, to ennoble and enrich us. The form of expression employed by <i>Matthew </i>is more simple, <i>Enter thou into the joy of thy master; </i>by which he means 			 that faithful servants, whose discharge of duty shall meet with his approbation, will share with himself a blessed abundance of all good things.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p36"></a>But it is asked, What is meant by what is added, <i>Take from him the talent, and give it to him who hath ten talents? </i>For every kind of <i>trading </i>will then be at an end. I reply, We ought to keep in remembrance what I formerly mentioned, that those who insist on 			 explaining, with exactness, every minute phrase, are mistaken. The true meaning is, though slothful and unprofitable servants are now endued with the gifts of the Spirit, yet they will at length be deprived of them all, that their wretched and shameful poverty may redound to the glory of the good. Now these slothful persons, Christ tells us, <i>hide </i>either the <i>talent </i>or the <i>pound </i>in the earth; because, while they consult their own ease and gratifications, they refuse to submit to any uneasiness; as we see very many who, while they are privately devoted to themselves and to their own advantage, avoid all the duties of charity, and have no regard to the general edification. When it is said that the master of the house, after his return, called the servants to account; as this ought to impart courage to the good, when they 			 understand that they do not lose their pains, so the indolent and careless, on the other hand, ought to be struck with no small terror. Let us therefore learn to call ourselves daily to account, before the Lord come, and <i>make a reckoning </i>with us.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxix-p38"></a><b>24.</b> <i>I knew thee, that thou art a harsh man.</i> This <i>harshness </i>has nothing to do with the substance of the parable; and it is an idle speculation in which those indulge, who reason from this passage, how 			 severely and rigorously God deals with his own people. For Christ did not intend to describe such <i>rigor</i>, any more than to applaud <i>usury</i>, when he represents the master of the house as saying, that the money ought to have been deposited with a <i>banker</i>, that it might, at least, <i>gain interest</i>  Christ only means, that there will be no excuse for the indolence of those who both conceal the gifts of God, and waste their time in idleness. Hence also we infer that no manner of life is more praiseworthy in the sight of God, than that which yields some advantage to human society.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ii.lxxix-p28"></a> An interpreter who was willing to twist a passage, so as to bring out of it any meaning that he chose, would find the vagueness of the Latin word <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.1"></a><i>virtus</i> to be well suited to his purpose. Its derivation from <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.2"></a><i>vir</i>,<i> a </i>man, shows that it originally signified <i>manliness</i>, from which it easily 				  passed to denote <i>courage</i>, and, from the high estimation in which <i>courage </i>was held among warlike nations, became the general expression for <i>moral excelle</i>n<i>ce</i>, out of which arose the application of it to other kinds of <i>excellence</i>, as in the phrase, <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.3"></a><i>virtutes orationis</i>,<i> the ornaments of style</i>. Again, from denoting <i>manly vigor </i>it came naturally to denote 				  <i>ability; </i>and it is undoubtedly in this sense, with which our English version accords, that <a name="ii.lxxix-p28.4"></a><i>rirtus</i> is employed by the Vulgate in this passage. — <i>Ed.</i></p>
