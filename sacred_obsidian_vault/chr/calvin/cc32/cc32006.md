 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.v-p7"></a><b><a name="ii.v-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luke 10:1</a><a name="ii.v-p7.1"></a>.</b> <i>And after these things the Lord appointed</i> That the Apostles had returned to Christ before these <i>seventy </i>were substituted in their room, may be inferred from many circumstances. The twelve, therefore, were sent to awaken in the Jews 			 the hope of an approaching salvation. After their return, as it was necessary that higher expectation should be excited, others were sent in greater numbers, as secondary heralds, to spread universally in every place the report of Christ’s coming. Strictly speaking, they received no commission, but were only sent by Christ as heralds, to prepare the minds of the people for receiving his doctrine. As to the number <i>seventy, </i>he appears to have 			 followed that order to which the people had already been long accustomed. We must bear in mind what has been already said about the <i>twelve </i>Apostles,   			  <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
  			  that as this was the number of the tribes when the people were in a flourishing condition, so an equal number of apostles or patriarchs was chosen, to reassemble the members of the lacerated body, that the restoration of the Church might thus be complete.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.v-p9"></a><a name="ii.v-p9.1"></a>There was a similar reason for these <i>seventy. </i><a name="ii.v-p9.2"></a>We <a name="ii.v-p9.3"></a>know that Moses, finding himself insufficient for the burden, took <i>seventy </i><a name="ii.v-p9.4"></a>judges to be associated with him in governing the people, (<a name="ii.v-p9.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022">Exod. 18:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001">Exod. 24:1</a><a name="ii.v-p9.5"></a><a name="ii.v-p9.6"></a>.) But when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, they had a council or <a name="ii.v-p9.7"></a>συνέδριον<a name="ii.v-p9.8"></a>—which was corrupted into <i>Sanedrin</i>   			  <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
  			 <a name="ii.v-p10.2"></a>—consisting <a name="ii.v-p10.3"></a>of seventy-two judges. As usually happens with such numbers, when they spoke of the council, they called them only the <i>seventy </i><a name="ii.v-p10.4"></a>judges; and Philo assures us, that they were chosen out of the posterity of David, that there might be some remaining authority in the royal line. After various calamities, this was the finishing stroke, when Herod abolished that 			 council, and thus deprived the people of a legitimate share in the government. Now as the return from Babylon prefigured a true and complete redemption, the reason why our Lord chooses <i>seventy </i><a name="ii.v-p10.5"></a>heralds of his coming appears to be, to hold out the restoration of their fallen state; and as the people were to be united under one head, he does not give them authority as judges, but only commands them to go before him, that he may possess the sole 			 power. <i>And sent them by two and two. H</i><a name="ii.v-p10.6"></a>e appears to have done so on account of their weakness. There was reason to fear, that individually they would not have the boldness necessary for the vigorous discharge of their office; and therefore, that they may encourage one another, they are sent <i>by two and two</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.v-p11"></a><a name="ii.v-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.v-p12"></a><b>2.</b> <i>The harvest is indeed abundant.</i> I have explained this passage under the ninth chapter of Matthew;   			  <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
  			  but it was proper to insert it again in this place, because it is related for a different purpose. In order to stimulate his disciples the more powerfully to apply with diligence to their work, he declares that <i>the harvest is abundant:</i> and hence it follows, that their labor will not be fruitless, but that they will find, in abundance, opportunities of 			 employment, and means of usefulness. He afterwards reminds them of dangers, contests, and annoyances, and bids them go and prepare themselves for traversing with speed the whole of Judea.   			  <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">33</font></a>
  			  In short, he repeats the same injunctions which he had given to the Apostles; and, therefore, it would serve no good purpose to trouble the reader here with many words, since a full exposition of all these matters may be found in the passage already quoted. We may notice briefly, however, the meaning of that expression, <i>salute no man by the way. </i>It indicates extreme haste, when, on meeting a person in <i>the way, </i>we pass on without speaking to him, lest he should detain us even for a short time. Thus, when Elisha sent his servant to the Shunamite woman, he charged him not to salute any person whom he met:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.v-p15"></a>if thou meet any man, salute him not; <br> 			 and if any salute thee, answer not again, (<a name="ii.v-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031">2Ki 4:31</a><a name="ii.v-p15.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.v-p16"></a>Christ does not intend that his disciples shall be so unkind  			  <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">34</font></a>
  			 as not to deign to salute persons whom they meet, but bids them hasten forward, so as to pass by every thing that would detain them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.v-p18"></a><a name="ii.v-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.v-p19"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Eating and drinking those things which they shall give you</i> This is another circumstance expressly mentioned by Luke. By these words Christ not only enjoins them to be satisfied with ordinary and plain food, but allows them to eat at another man’s table. Their plain and natural meaning 			 is: “you will be at liberty to live at the expense of others, so long as you shall be on this journey; for it is proper that those for whose benefit you labor should supply you with food.” Some think that they were intended to remove scruples of conscience, that the disciples might not find fault with any kind of food.   			  <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
  			  But nothing of this kind was intended, and it was not even his object to enjoin frugality, but merely to permit them to accept of a reward, by living, during this commission, at the expense of those by whom they were entertained.</p>
