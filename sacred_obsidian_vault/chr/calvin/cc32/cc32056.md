 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p13"></a><b><a name="ii.lv-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009">Matthew 17:9</a><a name="ii.lv-p13.2"></a>.</b> <i>And as they were going down from the mountain.</i> We have said that the time for making known <i>the vision </i>was not yet fully come; and, indeed, the disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not 			 given a more striking proof of his glory in his resurrection. But after that his divine power had been openly displayed, that temporary exhibition of his glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully evident that, even during the time that he <i>emptied himself</i>, (<a name="ii.lv-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Php 2:7</a><a name="ii.lv-p13.3"></a>,) he 			 continued to retain his divinity entire, though it was concealed under the veil of the flesh. There are good reasons, therefore, why he enjoins his disciples to keep silence, till he be risen from the dead.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lv-p14"></a><a name="ii.lv-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p15"></a><b>10.</b> <i>And his disciples asked him, saying.</i> No sooner is the resurrection mentioned than the disciples imagine that the reign of Christ is commenced;   			  <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">482</font></a>
  			 for they explain this word to mean that the world would acknowledge him to be the Messiah. That they imagined the resurrection to be something totally different from what Christ meant, is evident from what is stated by Mark, that <i>they disputed with each other what was the meaning of that expression which he had used, To rise from the dead</i>  Perhaps, too, they were already under the influence of that dream which is now held as an undoubted oracle among the Rabbins, that there would be a first and a second coming of the Messiah; that in the first he would be mean and despised, but that this would be shortly afterwards followed by his royal dignity. And, indeed, there is some plausibility in that error, for it springs from a true principle. The Scripture, too, speaks of a first and a second coming of the Messiah; for it 			 promises that he will be a Redeemer, to expiate by his sacrifice the sins of the world   			  <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">483</font></a>
  			  And such is the import of the following prophecies:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.lv-p18"></a>Rejoice, daughter of Zion, behold, thy King cometh, poor, sitting on an ass, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lv-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009">Zec 9:9</a><a name="ii.lv-p18.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.lv-p19"></a>We beheld him, and he had no form or beauty, and he resembled a leper, so that we had no esteem for him, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lv-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003">Isa. 53:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004">4</a><a name="ii.lv-p19.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p20"></a>Again, Scripture represents him as victorious over death, and as subjecting all things to his dominion. But we see how the Rabbins corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions; and as every thing was greatly corrupted in the time of our Lord, it is probable that the people had also embraced this foolish notion.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p21"></a><i>Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</i> The gross mistakes which they committed as to the person of <i>Elijah </i>have been pointed out on two or three occasions.   			  <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">484</font></a>
  			  Perhaps, too, they cunningly and wickedly endeavored to lessen the authority of Christ by bringing forward <i>Elijah; </i>for as it had been promised that <i>Elijah </i>would come as the forerunner of Messiah, <i>to prepare the way before him</i>, (<a name="ii.lv-p22.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal. 3:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005">Mal. 4:5</a><a name="ii.lv-p22.3"></a>,) it was easy to excite a prejudice against Christ, by saying that he came unaccompanied by <i>Elijah</i>  By a trick closely resembling this, the devil enchants the Papists of the present day not to 			 expect the day of judgment till Elijah and Enoch have appeared.   			  <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">485</font></a>
  			  It may not usually be conjectured that this expedient was purposely resorted to by the scribes, in order to represent Christ as unworthy of confidence, because he wanted the legitimate badge of the Messiah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lv-p24"></a><a name="ii.lv-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p25"></a><b>11. </b><i>Elijah indeed will come first. </i>We have stated elsewhere the origin of that error which prevailed among the Jews. As John the Baptist was to resemble <i>Elijah</i> by restoring the fallen condition of 			 the Church, the prophet Malachi (<a name="ii.lv-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005">Mal. 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006">6</a><a name="ii.lv-p25.2"></a>) had even given to him the name of <i>Elijah; </i>and this had been rashly interpreted by the scribes, as if <i>Elijah the Tishbite </i>(<a name="ii.lv-p25.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001">1Ki 17:1</a><a name="ii.lv-p25.3"></a>) were to return a second time to the world. Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its true meaning. “The promise,” says he, “that <i>Eliah </i>would come was true, and has been already fulfilled; but the scribes have 			 already rejected Elijah, whose name they idly and falsely plead in opposing me.”</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lv-p26"></a><i>And will restore all things.</i> This does not mean that <i>John the Baptist restored </i>them perfectly, but that he conveyed and handed them over to Christ, who would complete the work which he had begun. Now as the scribes had shamefully rejected John, Christ reminds his disciples that the 			 impostures of such men ought not to give them uneasiness, and that it ought not to be reckoned strange, if, after having rejected the servant, they should, with equal disdain, reject his Master. And that no one might be distressed by a proceeding so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained predictions of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers.</p>
