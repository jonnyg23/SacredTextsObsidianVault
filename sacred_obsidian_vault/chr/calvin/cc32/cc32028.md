 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p7"></a>I have resolved to place in immediate connection some events which are detailed by Luke alone, without a direct reference to dates; for on that point, as we have formerly mentioned, the Evangelists did not care much about exactness. We shall afterwards find a more suitable time for returning to the <i>Harmony of the Three Evangelists.</i></p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p9"></a><b>11. </b><i>And, lo, a woman</i> Here is related a miracle performed on a woman who was cured, and the offense which the malignity of the Jews led them to take up, because our Lord had cured her on a <i>Sabbath</i>-day Luke 			 says that the <i>woman </i>was held by a <i>spirit of infirmity, </i>so that her body was bent by the contraction of her nerves. As the nature of the disease is no farther described, it is probable that it was not one of an ordinary kind, or which was understood by physicians; and, therefore, he calls it a spirit of <i>infirmity. </i>We know that diseases of an unusual and extraordinary kind are, for the most part, inflicted on men through the agency of the devil; and this gave the more striking display of the divine power of Christ, which triumphed over Satan. Not that Satan rules over men according to his pleasure, but only so far as God grants to him permission to injure them. Besides, as the Lord, from whom alone all our blessings flow, makes his glory to shine with 			 peculiar brightness in those blessings which are more remarkable, and of rare occurrence; so, on the other hand, it is his will that the power and tyranny of Satan should be chiefly regarded in extraordinary chastisements, though his agency is likewise employed in those more gentle applications of the rod, which we experience from day to day.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p11"></a><b>12. </b><i>Woman, thou art delivered</i> In this miracle, as well as in others, Christ exhibited a proof both of his power and of his grace; for in this manner he testified that he had come for the purpose of granting relief to the wretched. His power is expressed in these words, <i>Woman, thou 			 art delivered; </i>for he authoritatively declares that deliverance was at his own disposal, and employs, at the same time, the outward sign, the use of which we have explained on a former occasion.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p13"></a><b>13. </b><i>And glorified God.</i> As to the people <i>glorifying God, </i>it is mentioned in order to inform us, that this was distinctly perceived to be a heavenly blessing. It was not some doubtful work which allowed room for argument on either side, but one which afforded 			 ample and undoubted grounds for praising God. This discovers more strongly the malignity of the <i>ruler of the synagogue</i></p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p15"></a><b>14. </b><i>There are six days.</i> This reprover does not venture to pass censure openly on Christ, but points the venom of his dislike to another quarter, and indirectly condemns Christ in the person of the multitude. What an astonishing display of furious malice! <i>Six days, </i>he tells them, were set apart for labor; but how incorrectly and foolishly does he define that <i>work, </i>which is not permitted but on <i>six days! </i>Why does he not likewise forbid them to enter the synagogue, lest they should violate the Sabbath? Why does he not order them to refrain from all the exercises of godliness? But granting that men are restrained 			 from following their own employments on <i>the Sabbath-day, </i>how unreasonable is it that the grace of God should be limited in that manner!</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p16"></a><i>On them, therefore, come and you shall be cured.</i> He bids them come on the other days to seek a <i>cure, </i>as if the power of God lay asleep <i>on Sabbath, </i>and were not rather exerted chiefly on that day for the salvation of his people. What 			 purpose is to be served by the holy assemblies, except to give an opportunity to believers for entreating the Divine assistance? That ungodly <i>hypocrite </i>talks as if the lawful observation of <i>the Sabbath </i>interrupted the course of God’s favors, hindered men from calling upon him, and took away from them all feeling of his kindness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xxvii-p17"></a><a name="ii.xxvii-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p18"></a><b>15. </b><i>Doth not every one of you? etc</i>  Such a combination of malice and stupidity might easily have been exposed in many ways, but Christ satisfied himself with this single argument. If it be lawful <i>on the Sabbath, </i>to perform the offices of humanity to cattle, it is ridiculous to imagine that the due observance of it will prevent assistance from being granted to the children of God. The words of Christ present a twofold comparison: that of the cattle with the <i>daughter of Abraham,</i> and that of the halter by which the <i>ass </i>or the <i>ox </i>is tied to <i>its stall </i>with the chains of Satan, by which he holds men bound to their destruction. “You,” says he, “who are so scrupulous about observing the Sabbath, venture to <i>loose oxen and asses, and lead them away to watering.</i> And why may not I be permitted to perform a similar office of kindness to the elect people of God; especially when the necessity is more urgent, when some one is to be delivered from the <i>snares of Satan?</i>”</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxvii-p19"></a>Now though the wicked reprover was struck dumb with shame, yet we perceive that Christ never performed any work, however illustrious, which wicked men did not seize as an occasion for slander. Nor need we wonder that Satan labored, with incessant zeal and exertions, to subvert the glory of Christ; for he is constantly employed in spreading his clouds, in order to darken the holy actions of believers.</p>
