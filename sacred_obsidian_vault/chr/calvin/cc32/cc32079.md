 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p11"></a>This shows how little attention Luke paid to observing the order of dates; for, after having detailed the miracle, he now relates what happened in the city of <i>Jericho</i>  He tells us that, while Christ presented himself to the view of all, as he went along the streets, 			 <i>Zaccheus</i> alone was very desirous to see him. For it was an evidence of intense desire that he <i>climbed up a tree; </i>since <i>rich </i>men are, for the most part, haughty, and plume themselves on affected gravity. It is 			 possible, indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man was most properly singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and on account of his wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly. Now, though faith was not yet formed in <i>Zaccheus</i>, yet this was a sort of preparation for it; for it was not without a heavenly inspiration that he desired so earnestly to get a sight of 			 Christ; I mean, in reference to that design which immediately appeared. Some were led, no doubt, by vain curiosity to run even from distant places, for the purpose of seeing Christ, but the event showed that the mind of <i>Zaccheus </i>contained some seed of piety. In this manner, before revealing himself to men, the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they are led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though 			 they have no fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but manifests himself in due time.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p13"></a><b>5. </b><i>Zaccheus, make haste, and come down.</i> It is a remarkable instance of favor, that the Lord anticipates <i>Zaccheus</i>, and does not wait for his invitation, but of his own accord asks lodging at his house. We 			 know how hateful, nay, how detestable the name of <i>publican </i>at that time was; and we shall find that this is shortly afterwards mentioned by Luke. It is therefore astonishing kindness in the Son of God to approach a man, from whom the great body of men recoil, and that before he is requested to do so. But we need not wonder, if he bestows this honor on one who was already drawn to him by a secret movement of the Spirit; for it was a more valuable 			 gift to dwell in his heart than to enter his house. But by this expression he made it evident, that he is never sought in vain by those who sincerely desire to know him; for <i>Zaccheus </i>obtained vastly more than he had expected. Besides, the great readiness of <i>Zaccheus </i>to obey, his <i>hastening to come down </i>from the tree, and his <i>joy </i>in <i>receiving </i>Christ, exhibit still more clearly the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit; for, though he did not yet possess a pure faith, yet this submissiveness and obedience must be regarded as the beginning of faith.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lxxviii-p14"></a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p15"></a><b>7. </b><i>And when they saw it, they all murmured.</i> The inhabitants of the town — and, perhaps, some of Christ’s followers — <i>murmur </i>that <i>he goes to lodge with a man 			 </i>who is looked upon as wicked and infamous, even though nobody invited him. It is thus that the world disregards the offer of the grace of God, but complains bitterly   			  <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">678</font></a>
  			  when it is conveyed to others. But let us consider how unjust this murmuring was. They think it unreasonable that Christ should bestows so great an honor on a wicked man; for in this passage, as in many others, the word <i>sinner </i>is not taken in the ordinary sense,   			  <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">679</font></a>
  			  but denotes a man of disgraceful and scandalous life. Let us suppose that <i>Zaccheus </i>was a person of this description. Still, we ought first to inquire for what purpose Christ chose to become his guest; for, while out of doors men are murmuring, <i>within </i>the house God displays magnificently the glory of this name, and refutes their wicked calumny.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p18"></a>The conversion of <i>Zaccheus </i>was an astonishing work of God, and yet there was no good reason why <i>Zaccheus </i>should be marked with infamy. He had the charge of collecting the taxes. Now to collect taxes was no crime in itself, but men of that class were exceedingly despised and hated by the Jews, because they reckoned it to be in the highest degree unjust that they should pay tribute. But whatever might be the character of 			 <i>Zaccheus</i>, still the kindness of Christ ought not to be blamed, but commended, in not refusing his assistance to a wretched man, to rescue him from destruction, and bring him to salvation. And therefore the offense which was wickedly taken did not hinder him from proceeding to execute his Father’s command. With such magnanimity ought all his ministers to be endued, as to think more highly of the salvation of one soul than of the murmurs which all ignorant persons may utter, and not 			 to desist from their duty, even though all their actions and words may expose them to reproaches.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lxxviii-p19"></a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p20"></a><b>8. </b><i>And Zaccheus stood, and said.</i> From this result they ought to have formed their opinion of what Christ did; but men are so hasty and precipitate, that they do not take time to wait for God.   			  <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">680</font></a>
  			  The conversion of Zaceheus is described by fruits and outward signs. As it was probable that he had enriched himself to the injury of others,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p22"></a>if he had wronged any man, he was ready to restore fourfold. Besides, the half of his goods he dedicates to the poor. A man might indeed bestow all his goods on the poor, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxxviii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003">1Co 13:3</a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p22.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p23"></a>and yet his generosity might be of no value in the sight of God; but, though no mention is here made of inward repentance, yet Luke means that the godly zeal, which he commends in <i>Zaccheus</i>, proceeded from that living root. In like manner, Paul, when treating of repentance, exhorts us to those duties, by which men may learn that we are changed for the better.</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p24"></a>Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labor with his hands, that he may assist the poor and needy, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxxviii-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028">Eph 4:28</a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p24.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p25"></a>We ought therefore to begin with the heart, but our repentance ought also to be evinced by works.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p26"></a>Now let us observe that <i>Zaccheus </i>does not make a present to God out of his extortions, as many rich men give to God a portion of what they have obtained by dishonesty, that they may the more freely pillage in future, and that they may be acquitted of the wrongs which they have formerly done. But <i>Zaccheus </i>devotes 			 <i>the half of his goods</i> to God in such a manner, as to give, at the same time, compensation for whatever wrongs he has done; and hence we infer that the riches which he possessed were not the fruit of dishonest gain. Thus <i>Zaccheus </i>is not only ready to give satisfaction, if he <i>has taken any thing by fraud</i>, but shares his lawful possessions with the poor; by which he shows that he is changed from a wolf not only into a sheep, but even into a shepherd. And while he corrects the faults which had been formerly committed, he renounces wicked practices for the future, as God demands from his people, first of all, that they abstain from doing any act of injury. <i>Zaccheus </i>has not laid others under obligation, by his example, to strip themselves of <i>the half of their goods; </i>but we have only to observe the rule which the Lord prescribes, that we dedicate ourselves, and all that we have, to holy and lawful purposes.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lxxviii-p27"></a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p27.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p28"></a><b>9. </b><i>Today is salvation come to this house.</i> Christ, bearing testimony to Zaccheus, declares that his professions were not hypocritical. And yet he does not ascribe to the good works of Zaccheus the cause of <i>salvation; </i>but, as that conversion was an 			 undoubted pledge of the divine adoption, he justly concludes from it that <i>this house </i>is a possessor of <i>salvation</i>  Such, to is the import of the words for, since Zaccheus is one of the <i>children of Abraham</i>, he argues that his <i>house </i>is saved. In order that any man may be reckoned among the <i>children of Abraham</i>, it is necessary for him to imitate <i>Abraham’s </i>faith; nay, Scripture expressly bestows on faith this commendation, that it distinguishes the genuine <i>children of Abraham </i>from 			 strangers. Let us therefore know that in Zaccheus faith is chiefly commended, on account of which his good works were acceptable to God. Nor is there reason to doubt that the doctrine of Christ went before the conversion of Zaccheus; and, consequently, the commencement of his salvation was, to hear Christ discoursing on the undeserved mercy of God, and on the reconciliation of men to Him, and on the redemption of the Church, and to embrace this doctrine by faith.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.lxxviii-p29"></a><a name="ii.lxxviii-p29.1"></a>In consequence of the Greek word <a name="ii.lxxviii-p29.2"></a>οἴκος<a name="ii.lxxviii-p29.3"></a>; <i>(house) </i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p29.4"></a>being of the masculine gender, this passage is explained in two ways. The old translator   			  <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">681</font></a>
  			 <a name="ii.lxxviii-p30.2"></a> has made the reference to be to Zaccheus, which I also prefer.   			  <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">682</font></a>
  			  <i>Erastians </i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p31.15"></a>has chosen to render it, <i>inasmuch as </i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p31.16"></a>The House<a name="ii.lxxviii-p31.17"></a>, <i>itself is a </i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p31.18"></a>Daughter<a name="ii.lxxviii-p31.19"></a> of <i>Abraham;</i>   			  <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">683</font></a>
  			  <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.2"></a>and although I do not disapprove of this, I think it more natural to explain it as referring to <i>Zacche</i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.3"></a>u<i>s</i>  <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.4"></a>For, since God, when he adopts the head of a family, promises that He will be a God even to his whole house, <i>salvation</i> <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.5"></a>is, with propriety, extended from the head to the whole body. Now the particle <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.6"></a>καὶ<i> (also) </i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.7"></a>is emphatic; for Christ means, that <i>Zaccheus</i><a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.8"></a>, <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.9"></a>not less than the other Jews who haughtily detested 			 him, is <i>a son of Abraham</i>  <a name="ii.lxxviii-p32.10"></a>And that his former life may not seem to have shut against him the gate of salvation, Christ argues from his own office, that there is nothing in this change at which any man ought to take offense, since he was sent by the Father to <i>save those who were lost.</i></p>
