 <p>The Ave Maria (Hail Mary) is one of the oldest and most popular
 Catholic prayers.  Of unknown origin, it was not
 officially incorporated into the liturgy (as part of the Rosary) 
 until the 15th Century.</p>
 
 <center><h1>Ave Maria</h1></center>
          
 <p>AVE Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et
 benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater
 Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis
 nostrae. Amen.</p>
          
 <center><h1>Hail Mary</h1></center>
          
 <p>HAIL Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
 Blessed art thou amongst women
 and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,
 Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of
 our death. Amen.</p>
