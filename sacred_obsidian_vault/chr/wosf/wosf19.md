 <p>This little prayer enjoys the same title to authenticity as the preceding opuscule, and Professor Boehmer <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">1</font></a> and M. Sabatier <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">2</font></a> are in complete accord with the Quaracchi editors as to its genuinity. With the exception of the Assisi codex, it is found in all the early MS. collections containing the Praises. The text here translated is based on the MS. at Ognissanti and St. Isidore's (1/25), which were collated by the Quaracchi editors with the versions given in the <i>Conformities</i> (fruct. xii, P. II, c. v.) and the <i>Speculum B. Francisci</i> (ed. 1 and 2, fol. 127 r).</p>  <h4 align="center">SALUTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">3</font></a></h4>  
 <p>Hail, holy Lady, most holy Queen, Mother of God, Mary who art ever Virgin, chosen from Heaven by the most Holy Father, whom He has consecrated with the most holy beloved Son and the Ghostly Paraclete, in whom was and is all the fulness of grace and all good.

 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="wosf19.htm#fr_547">144:1</a> The text of the <i>Conformities</i> and Wadding here add the second part of the antiphon given below in the Office of the Passion beginning "Mother of our most Holy Lord Jesus Christ," etc. In the <i>Speculum</i> (ed. Morin, 1509) this Salutation is followed by another prayer to the Blessed Virgin (see Sabatier, <i>Opuscules</i>, fasc. x, p. 164); but from the beginning of the seventeenth century, the second prayer is no longer found in the text of the <i>Speculum</i> (see the edition of Spoelberch, P. I, pp. 176-178, and Wadding, <i>Opusc.</i>, p. 107). In the opinion of Professor Boehmer this Salutation ought to follow immediately after the Salutation of the Virtues given above (<a href="wosf04.htm#page_20">p. 20</a>). See his <i>Analekten</i>, pp. vi and xxviii. They are found in this order in the <i>Spec. Vitae</i> of 3504 and the Vatican MS. 4354.</p>
