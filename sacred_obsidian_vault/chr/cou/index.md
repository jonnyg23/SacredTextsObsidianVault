 This is Evelyn Underhill's translation of the medieval spiritual
 guidebook called <cite>The Cloud of Unknowing</cite>, written
 by an anonymous English monk.
 At the core is a mystical approach to Christian prayer, in which
 God is found not through rote knowledge, but through 'blind love.'
 It has been described as Christianity with a Zen outlook.
 --J.B. Hare
