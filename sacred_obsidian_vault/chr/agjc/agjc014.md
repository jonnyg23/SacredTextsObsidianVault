 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 11</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Elihu's lessons. Buddhism and the precepts of Buddha. The mysteries of Egypt.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Again Elihu taught; he said, The Indian priests became corrupt; Brahm was forgotten in the streets; the rights of men were trampled in the dust.<br> <b>2. </b>And the a mighty master came, a Buddha of enlightenment, who turned away from wealth and all the honours of the world, and found the Silence in the quiet groves and caves; and he was blest.<br> <b>3. </b>He preached a gospel of the higher life, and taught man how to honour man.<br> <b>4. </b>He had no doctrine of the gods to teach; he just knew man, and so his creed was justice, love and righteousness.<br> <b>5. </b>I quote for you a few of many of the helpful words which Buddha spoke:<br> <b>6. </b>Hate is a cruel word. If men hate you regard it not; and you can turn the hate of men to love and mercy and goodwill, and mercy is as large as all the heavens.<br> <b>7. </b>And there is good enough for all. With good destroy the bad; with generous deeds make avarice ashamed; with truth make straight the crooked lines that error draws, for error is but truth distorted, gone astray.<br> <b>8. </b>And pain will follow him who speaks or acts with evil thoughts, as does the wheel the foot of him who draws the cart.<br> <b>9. </b>He is a greater man who conquers self than he who kills a thousand men in war.<br> <b>10. </b>He is the noble man who is himself what he believes what other men should be.<br> <b>11. </b>Return to him who does you wrong your purest love, and he will cease from doing wrong; for love will purify the heart of him who is beloved as truly as it purifies the heart of him who loves.<br> <b>12. </b>The words of Buddha are recorded in the Indian sacred books; attend to them, for they are part of the instructions of the Holy Breath.<br> <b>13. </b>The land of Egypt is the land of secret things.<br> <b>14. </b>The mysteries of the ages lie lock-bound in our temples and our shines.<br> <b>15. </b>The masters of all times and climes come here to learn; and when your sons have grown to manhood they will finish all their studies in Egyptian schools.<br> <b>16. </b>But I have said enough. To-morrow at the rising of the sun we meet again.</p>
