 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 53</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus passes the sixth brotherhood test and receives the sixth degree, LOVE DIVINE.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>In all the land there is no place more grandly furnished than the Beauty Parlours of the temple of the sun.<br> <b>2. </b>Few students ever entered these rich rooms; the priests regarded them with awe, and called them Halls of Mysteries.<br> <b>3. </b>When Jesus had attained the victory over fear, he gained the right to enter here.<br> <b>4. </b>The guide led on the way, and after passing many richly furnished rooms they reached the Hall of Harmony; and here was Jesus left alone.<br> <b>5. </b>Among the instruments of music was a harpsichord, and Jesus sat in thoughtful mood inspecting it, when, quietly, a maiden of entrancing beauty came into the hall.<br> <b>6. </b>She did not seem to notice Jesus as he sat and mused, so busy with his thoughts.<br> <b>7. </b>She found her place beside the harpsichord; she touched the chords most gently, and she sung the songs of Israel.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus was entranced; such beauty he had never seen; such music he had never heard.<br> <b>9. </b>The maiden sung her songs; she did not seem to know that any one was near; she went her way.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus, talking with himself, said out, What is the meaning of this incident? I did not know that such entrancing beauty and such queen-like loveliness were ever found among the sons of men.<br> <b>11. </b>I did not know that voice of angel ever graced a human form, or that seraphic music ever came from human lips.<br> <b>12. </b>For days he sat entranced; the current of his thoughts was changed; he thought of nothing but the singer and her songs.<br> <b>13. </b>He longed to see her once again; and after certain days she came; she spoke and laid her hand upon his head.<br> <b>14. </b>Her touch thrilled all his soul, and for the time, forgotten was the work that he was sent to do.<br> <b>15. </b>Few were the words the maiden said; she went her way; but then the heart of Jesus had been touched.<br> <b>16. </b>A love-flame had been kindled in his soul, and he was brought to face the sorest trial of his life.<br> <b>17. </b>He could not sleep nor eat. Thoughts of the maiden came; they would not go. His carnal nature called aloud for her companionship.<br> <b>18. </b>And then he said, Lo, I have conquered every foe that I have met, and shall I now be conquered by this carnal love?<br> <b>19. </b>My Father sent me here to show the power of love divine, that love that reaches every living thing.<br> <b>20. </b>Shall this pure, universal love be all absorbed by carnal love? Shall I forget all creatures else, and lose my life in this fair maiden, though she is the highest type of beauty, purity and love?<br> <b>21. </b>Into its very depths his soul was stirred, and long he wrestled with this angel-idol of his heart.<br> <b>22. </b>But when the day was almost lost, his higher ego rose in might; he found himself again, and then he said,<br> <b>23. </b>Although my heart shall break I will not fail in this my hardest task; I will be victor over carnal love.<br> <b>24. </b>And when again the maiden came, and offered him her hand and heart, he said,<br> <b>25. </b>Fair one, your very presence thrills me with delight; your voice is benediction to my soul; my human self would fly with you, and be contented in your love;<br> <b>26. </b>But all the world is craving for a love that I have come to manifest.<br> <b>27. </b>I must, then, bid you go; but we will meet again; our ways on earth will not be cast apart.<br> <b>28. </b>I see you in the hurrying throngs of earth as minister of love; I hear your voice in song, that wins the hearts of men to better things.<br> <b>29. </b>And then in sorrow and in tears the maiden went away, and Jesus was again alone.<br> <b>30. </b>And instantly the great bells of the temple rang; the singers sung a new, new song; the grotto blazed with light.<br> <b>31. </b>The hierophant himself appeared, and said, All hail! triumphant Logos, hail! The conqueror of carnal love stands on the heights.<br> <b>32. </b>And then he placed in Jesus' hands a scroll on which was written, LOVE DIVINE.<br> <b>33. </b>Together they passed through the grotto of the beautiful, and in the banquet hall a feast was served, and Jesus was the honoured guest.</p>
