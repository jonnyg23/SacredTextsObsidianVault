 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 175</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus appears, fully materialised to the ten apostles in Simon's house, and to Lazarus and his sisters.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The evening of the resurrection day had come; the ten apostles were in Simon's house in Bethany. The lawyer, Thomas, was not there.<br> <b>2. </b>The doors were closed and barred, because the Jews had said that they would drive the Galileans from the land.<br> <b>3. </b>And as they talked, lo, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said, Peace! peace!<br> <b>4. </b>And the disciples shrank in fear; they thought it was a phantom that they saw.<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus said, Why are you troubled thus? Why do you fear? I am no phantom form. I am your Lord, and I have risen from the dead.<br> <b>6. </b>I often said, I will arise; but you believed me not; and now come here and see. A phantom has not flesh and bones and brawn, like I possess.<br> <b>7. </b>Come now, and clasp my hands, and touch my feet, and lay your hands upon my head.<br> <b>8. </b>And every one came up and clasped his hands, and touched his feet, and laid his hands upon his head.<br> <b>9. </b>And Jesus said, Have you here anything to eat.<br> <b>10. </b>And they brought out a fragment of a fish; he ate it in the presence of them all and then the ten believed.<br> <b>11. </b>Nathaniel said, And now we know that he has risen from the dead; he stands a surety of the resurrection of the dead. And Jesus disappeared.<br> <b>12. </b>Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth and Lazarus were in their home, and they had heard the rumour that their Lord had risen from the dead, and Martha said,<br> <b>13. </b>It cannot be, for such a thing has never happened since the world began.<br> <b>14. </b>But Mary said, Did not the Lord bring back our brother from the dead? and he could surely bring himself to life again.<br> <b>15. </b>And as they talked, the Lord stood in their midst and said,<br> <b>16. </b>All hail! For I am risen from the dead, first fruitage of the grave!<br> <b>17. </b>And Martha ran and brought the chair in which the Lord had ever loved to sit, and Jesus sat down on the chair.<br> <b>18. </b>And for a long, long time they talked about the trial, and the scenes of Calvary and of the garden of Siloam.<br> <b>19. </b>Then Jesus said, Fear not, for I will be your boon companion all the way; and then he disappeared.</p>
