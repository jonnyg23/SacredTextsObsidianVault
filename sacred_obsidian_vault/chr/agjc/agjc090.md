 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 87</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines go to Cana. Jesus heals a noblesman's child. The Christines go to Capernaum. Jesus provides a spacious home for his mother. He announces his intention to choose twelve apostles.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>In Nazareth Jesus taught no more; he went with his disciples up to Cana, where, at a marriage feast, he once turned water into wine.<br> <b>2. </b>And here he met a man of noble birth whose home was in Capernaum, whose son was sick.<br> <b>3. </b>The man had faith in Jesus' power to heal, and when he learned that he had come to Galilee he went in haste to meet him on the way.<br> <b>4. </b>The man met Jesus at the seventh hour, and he entreated him to hasten to Capernaum to save hi son.<br> <b>5. </b>But Jesus did not go; he stood aside in silence for a time, and then he said, Your faith has proved a healing balm; your son is well.<br> <b>6. </b>The man believed and went his way toward Capernaum and as he went he met a servant from his home who said,<br> <b>7. </b>My lord, You need not haste; your son is well.<br> <b>8. </b>The father asked, When did my son begin to mend?<br> <b>9. </b>The servant said, On yesterday about the seventh hour the fever left.<br> <b>10. </b>And then the father knew it was the healing balm that Jesus sent that saved his son.<br> <b>11. </b>In Cana Jesus tarried not he went his way with his disciples to Capernaum, where he secured a spacious house where, with his mother, he could live, where his disciples might repair to hear the Word.<br> <b>12. </b>He called the men who had confessed their faith in him to meet him in his home, which his disciples called, The school of Christ; and when they came he said to them,<br> <b>13. </b>This gospel of the Christ must be proclaimed in all the world.<br> <b>14. </b>This Christine vine will be a mighty vine whose branches will comprise the peoples, tribes and tongues of all the earth.<br> <b>15. </b>I am the vine; twelve men shall be the branches of the stock, and these shall send forth branches everywhere;<br> <b>16. </b>And from among the people who have followed me, the Holy Breath will call the twelve.<br> <b>17. </b>Go now and do your work as you have done your work; but listen for the call.<br> <b>18. </b>Then the disciples went unto their daily tasks, to do their work as they had done, and Jesus went alone into the Hammoth hills to pray.<br> <b>19. </b>Three days and nights he spent communing with the Silent Brotherhood; then, in the power of Holy breath he came to call the twelve.</p>
