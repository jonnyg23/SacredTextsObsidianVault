 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 86</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines are in Nazareth. Jesus speaks in the synagogue. He offends the people and they attempt to kill him. He mysteriously disappears, and returns to the synagogue.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Christines were in Nazareth. It was the Sabbath day, and Jesus went up to the synagogue.<br> <b>2. </b>The keeper of the books gave one to Jesus and he opened it and read:<br> <b>3. </b>The Spirit of the Lord has overshadowed me; he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; to set the captives free; to open sightless eyes;<br> <b>4. </b>To bring relief to those oppressed and bruised, and to proclaim, The year of jubilee has come.<br> <b>5. </b>When he had read these words he closed the book and said, This scripture is fulfilled before your eyes this day. The year of jubilee has come; the time when Israel shall bless the world.<br> <b>6. </b>And then he told them many thing about the kingdom of the Holy One; about the hidden way of life; about forgiveness of sins.<br> <b>7. </b>Now, many people knew not who the speaker was: And others said, Is not this Joseph's son? Does not his mother live on Marmion way?<br> <b>8. </b>And one spoke out and said, This is the man who did such mighty works in Cana, in Capernaum, and in Jerusalem.<br> <b>9. </b>And then the people said, Physician heal yourself. Do here among your kindred all the mighty works that you have done in other towns.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said, No prophet is received with honour by the people of his native land; and prophets are not sent to every one.<br> <b>11. </b>Elijah was a man of God; he had the power and he closed the gates of heaven, and it did not rain for forty months; and when he spoke the Word, the rain come on, the earth brought forth again.<br> <b>12. </b>And there were many widows in the land; but this Elijah went to none but Zarephath, and she was blessed.<br> <b>13. </b>And when Elisha lived, lo, many lepers were in Israel, but none were cleansed save one--the Syrian who had faith.<br> <b>14. </b>You have no faith; you seek for signs to satisfy your curious whims; but you shall see not till you open up your eyes of faith.<br> <b>15. </b>And then the people were enraged; they rushed upon him, bound him down with cords, and took him to a precipice not far away, intent to cast him down to death;<br> <b>16. </b>But when they thought they held him fast, he disappeared; unseen he passed among the angry men, and went his way.<br> <b>17. </b>The people were confounded and they said, What manner of a man is this?<br> <b>18. </b>And when they came again to Nazareth, they found him teaching in the synagogue.<br> <b>19. </b>They troubled him no more for they were sore afraid.</p>
