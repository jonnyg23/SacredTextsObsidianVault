 </i><p>In response to inquiries from many friends of "The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ" for some information regarding the transcriber, we herewith give a short sketch. It was his great desire that each one should have the message regardless of the messenger.</p> 
 <p>LEVI (Levi H. Dowling), was born Friday morning, May 18, 1844, at Belleville, Ohio. His father, Scotch-Welsh descent, was a pioneer preacher among the Disciples of Christ. Levi was always a student of the deeper things of life. At the age of thirteen, in his first public debate, he took the negative side against a Presbyterian Elder on "The Everlasting Punishment of the Wicked."</p> 
 <p>He began preaching at the age of sixteen; and at the age of eighteen was pastor of a small church. He entered the United States Army at the age of twenty as Chaplain, and served in this capacity to the end of the Civil War. In 1866-7 he was a student at Northwestern Christian University at Indianapolis, Indiana. The next year he began publishing Sunday School Literature, issuing Sunday School Lesson Papers, Song Books, and a Children's Sunday School Paper. Much of his time was devoted to the cause of Prohibition. He was a graduate of two medical colleges and practised medicine for a number of years. He finally retired from the medical profession to resume literary work.</p> 
 <p>Early in life, when but a mere lad, he had a vision in which he was told that he was to "build a white city." This vision was repeated three times with years intervening. The building of the "white city" was "The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ." This book was transcribed between the early morning hours of two and six--the absolutely "quiet hours."</p> 
 <p>Levi passed from earth-life August 13, 1911.</p>
