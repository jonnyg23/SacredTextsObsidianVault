 </i><p>Meeting of the sages, continued. Opening addresses. Seven days' silence.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Ashbina said, Assyria is the land of doubt; the chariot of my people, that in which they mostly ride, is labelled Doubt.<br> <b>2. </b>Once Faith walked forth in Babylon; and she was bright and fair; but she clothed in such white robes that men became afraid of her.<br> <b>3. </b>And every wheel began to turn, and Doubt made war on her, and drove her from the land; and she came back no more.<br> <b>4. </b>In form men worship God, the One; in heart they are not sure that God exists.<br> <b>5. </b>Faith worships at the shrine of one not seen; but Doubt must see her God.<br> <b>6. </b>The greatest need of all Assyria is faith--a faith that seasons every thing that is, with certainty.<br> <b>7. </b>And then Apollo said, The greatest needs of Greece are true concepts of God.<br> <b>8. </b>Theogony in Greece is rudderless, for every thought may be a god, and worshipped as a god.<br> <b>9. </b>The plane of thought is broad, and full of sharp antagonists; and so the circle of the gods is filled with enmity, with wars and base intrigues.<br> <b>10. </b>Greece needs a master mind to stand above the gods; to raise the thoughts of men away from many gods to God the One.<br> <b>11. </b>We know that light is coming o'er the hills. God speed the light.<br> <b>12. </b>Matheno said, Behold this land of mystery! this Egypt of the dead!<br> <b>13. </b>Our temples long have been the tombs of all the hidden things of time; our temples, crypts and caves are dark.<br> <b>14. </b>In light there are no secret things. The sun reveals all hidden truth. There are no mysteries in God.<br> <b>15. </b>Behold the rising sun! His beams are entering every door; yea, every crevice of the mystic crypt of Mizraim.<br> <b>16. </b>We hail the light! All Egypt craves the light.<br> <b>17. </b>And Philo said, The need of Hebrew thought and life is liberty.<br> <b>18. </b>The Hebrew prophets, seers, and givers of the law, were men of power, men of holy thought, and they bequeathed to us a system of philosophy that is ideal; one strong enough and good enough to lead our people to the goal of perfectness.<br> <b>19. </b>But carnal minds repudiated holiness; a priesthood filled with selfishness arose, and purity in heart became a myth; the people were enslaved.<br> <b>20. </b>The priesthood is the curse of Israel; but when he comes, who is to come, he will proclaim emancipation for the slaves; my people will be free.<br> <b>21. </b>Behold, for God has made incarnate wisdom, love and light, which he has called Immanuel.<br> <b>22. </b>To him is given the keys to open up the dawn; and here, as man, he walks with us.<br> <b>23. </b>And then the council chamber door was opened and the Logos stood among the sages of the world.<br> <b>24. </b>Again the sages sat in silence seven days.</p>
