 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 93</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines go through a field of ripe wheat, and the disciples eat of the wheat. Jesus exonerates them. The Christines return to Capernaum. Jesus heals a withered hand on the Sabbath, and defends his deed.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Another Sabbath day had come and Jesus and the twelve walked through a field of ripened wheat.<br> <b>2. </b>And they were hungry and they took the heads of wheat and in their hands threshed out the grain and ate.<br> <b>3. </b>Among the men who followed them were Pharisees of strictest sect, and when they saw the twelve thresh out the wheat and eat, they said to Jesus,<br> <b>4. </b>Sir, why do the twelve do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus said, Have you not heard what David did when he and those who followed him had need of food?<br> <b>6. </b>How he went to the house of God and from the table in the Holy Place took of the presence bread and ate, and gave to those who followed him?<br> <b>7. </b>I tell you, men, the needs of man are higher than the law of rites.<br> <b>8. </b>And in our sacred books we read how priests profane the Sabbath day in many ways while they are serving in the Holy Place, and still are free from guilt.<br> <b>9. </b>The Sabbath day was made for man; man was not made to fit the Sabbath day.<br> <b>10. </b>The man is son of God and under the eternal law of right, which is the highest law, he may annul the statute laws.<br> <b>11. </b>The law of sacrifice is but the law of man, and in our law we read that God desires mercy first; and mercy stands above all statute laws.<br> <b>12. </b>The son of man is Lord of every law. Did not a prophet sum the duties of the man when in the book he wrote: In mercy follow justice and walk humbly with your God?<br> <b>13. </b>Then Jesus and the twelve returned to Galilee, and on the day before the Sabbath day they reached the home of Jesus in Capernaum.<br> <b>14. </b>And on the Sabbath day they went up to the synagogue. The multitudes were there and Jesus taught.<br> <b>15. </b>Among the worshippers was one, a man who had a withered hand. The scribes and Pharisees observed that Jesus saw the man, and then they said,<br> <b>16. </b>What will he do? Will he attempt to heal upon the Sabbath day?<br> <b>17. </b>And Jesus knew their thoughts and he called to the man who had the withered hand and said, Arise, stand forth before these men.<br> <b>18. </b>And Jesus said, You scribes and Pharisees, speak out and answer me: Is it a crime to save a life upon the Sabbath day?<br> <b>19. </b>If you had sheep and one of them fell in a pit upon the Sabbath day would you do wrong to take it out?<br> <b>20. </b>Or would it please your God to let it suffer in the mire until another day?<br> <b>21. </b>But his accusers held their peace.<br> <b>22. </b>And then he said to them, Are sheep of greater value than a man?<br> <b>23. </b>The law of God is written on the rock of Right; and Justice wrote the law, and Mercy was the pen.<br> <b>24. </b>And then he said, Man, raise your hand and stretch it forth. He raised his hand; it was restored.<br> <b>25. </b>The Pharisees were filled with rage. They called in secret council the Herodians, and they began to plot and plan how they might bring about his death.<br> <b>26. </b>They were afraid to publicly accuse, because the multitudes stood forth in his defence.<br> <b>27. </b>And Jesus and the twelve went down and walked beside the sea, and many people followed them.</p>
