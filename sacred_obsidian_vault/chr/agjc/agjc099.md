 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 96</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus considers the Ten Commandments. The philosophy of Christ the spirit of the Commandments. Jesus unfolds the spiritual aspects of the first four Commandments.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>God gave the Ten Commandments unto men; upon the mountain Moses saw the words of God; he wrote them down on solid rock; they cannot be destroyed.<br> <b>2. </b>These Ten Commandments show the justice side of God; but now the love of God made manifest brings mercy on the wings of Holy Breath.<br> <b>3. </b>Upon the unity of God the law was built. In all the world there is one force; Jehovah is Almighty God.<br> <b>4. </b>Jehovah wrote upon the heavens and Moses read,<br> <b>5. </b>I am Almighty God and you shall have no God but me.<br> <b>6. </b>There is one force, but many phases of that force; these phases men call powers.<br> <b>7. </b>All powers are of God; and they are manifests of God; they are Spirits of the God.<br> <b>8. </b>If men could seem to find another force and worship at its shrine, they would but court illusion, vain,<br> <b>9. </b>A shadow of the One, Jehovah, God, and they who worship shadows are but shadows on the wall; for men are what court.<br> <b>10. </b>And God would have all men to be the substance, and in mercy he commanded, You shall seek no God but me.<br> <b>11. </b>And finite men can never comprehend infinite things. Man cannot make an image of the Infinite in force.<br> <b>12. </b>And when men make a God of stone or wood or clay they make an image of a shade; and they who worship at the shrine of shades are shades.<br> <b>13. </b>So God in mercy said, You shall not carve out images of wood, or clay, or stone.<br> <b>14. </b>Such idols are ideals, abased ideals, and men can gain no higher plane than their ideals.<br> <b>15. </b>The God is Spirit men must worship if they would attain a consciousness of God.<br> <b>16. </b>But man can never make a picture or an image of the Holy Breath.<br> <b>17. </b>The name of God man may not speak with carnal lips; with Holy Breath alone can man pronounce the name.<br> <b>18. </b>In vanity men think they know the name of God; they speak it lightly and irreverently, and thus they are accursed.<br> <b>19. </b>If men did know the sacred name and spoke it with unholy lips, they would not live to speak it once again.<br> <b>20. </b>But God in mercy has not yet unveiled his name to those who cannot speak with Holy Breath.<br> <b>21. </b>But they who speak the substitute in idle way are guilty in the sight of God, who said,<br> <b>22. </b>You shall not take the name of God in vain.<br> <b>23. </b>The number of the Holy Breath is seven, and God holds in his hands the sevens of time.<br> <b>24. </b>In forming worlds he rested on the seventh day, and every seventh day is set apart as Sabbath day for men. God said,<br> <b>25. </b>The seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; remember it and keep it wholly set apart for works of holiness; that is, for works not for the selfish self, but for the universal self.<br> <b>26. </b>Men may do work for self upon the six days of the week; but on the Sabbath of the Lord they must do naught for self.<br> <b>27. </b>This day is consecrated unto God; but man serves God by serving man.</p>
