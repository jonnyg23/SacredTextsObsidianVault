 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 137</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus and his disciples go into a retired place to pray. Jesus teaches Lazarus how to pray. The model prayer. The value of importunate prayer. Parable of the importunate housewife.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, in the evening Jesus, Peter, James and John, with Lazarus, went out beyond the village gates to pray. And Lazarus said, Teach me to pray.<br> <b>2. </b>And Jesus said, The prayer I taught the twelve to pray while we were up in Galilee is one acceptable to God; and when you pray just say,<br> <b>3. </b>Our Father-God who art in heaven; holy is thy name; thy kingdom come; they will be done on earth as it is done in heaven;<br> <b>4. </b>Give us this day our needed bread;<br> <b>5. </b>Help us forget the debts that other people owe to us, that all our debts may be discharged;<br> <b>6. </b>And shield us from the tempter's snares that are too great for us to bear;<br> <b>7. </b>And when they come give us the strength to overcome.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus said, The answer to your prayer may not appear in fulness in a little time.<br> <b>9. </b>Be not discouraged; pray again and then again, for God will hear.<br> <b>10. </b>And then he spoke a parable; he said, A housewife was alone at night and, lo, some guests arrived, and they were hungry, having had no food for all the day.<br> <b>11. </b>The housewife had no bread, and so at midnight she went forth and called a friend and said, Loan me three loaves of bread, for guests have come, and I have naught for them to eat.<br> <b>12. </b>The friend replied, Why do you trouble me at midnight hour? My door is shut; my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise to give you bread; to-morrow you can be supplied.<br> <b>13. </b>The housewife asked again, and then again, and then because she pled, and would not be refused, the friend arose and gave her bread.<br> <b>14. </b>Behold, I say to you, Ask firmly and you shall receive; seek trustingly and you shall find; knock earnestly, the door will open up.<br> <b>15. </b>All things are yours, and when you ask, not as a begging man would ask, but as a child, you shall be satisfied.<br> <b>16. </b>A son may ask his father for a loaf of bread; the father will not give to him a stone;<br> <b>17. </b>Or he may ask him for a fish; he will not give a crab; or he may ask him for an egg; the father will not give a pebble from the brook.<br> <b>18. </b>Behold, if men of flesh know how to give abundantly to children of the flesh, will not your heavenly Father give abundantly to you when you shall pray?</p>
