 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 67</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus visits John at the Jordan. Delivers his first Christine address to the people. The address. He goes with his disciples to Bethany.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, on the morrow Jesus came again and stood with John beside the ford; and John prevailed on him to speak, and standing forth he said.<br> <b>2. </b>You men of Israel, Hear! The kingdom is at hand.<br> <b>3. </b>Behold the great key-keeper of the age stands in your midst; and with the spirit of Elijah he has come.<br> <b>4. </b>Behold, for he has turned the key; the mighty gates fly wide and all who will may greet the king.<br> <b>5. </b>Behold these multitudes of women, children, men! they throng the avenues, they crowd the outer courts; each seems to be intent to be the first to meet the king.<br> <b>6. </b>Behold, the censor comes and calls, Whoever will may come; but he who comes must will to prune himself of every evil thought;<br> <b>7. </b>Must overcome desire to gratify the lower self; must give his life to save the lost.<br> <b>8. </b>The nearer to the kingdom gate you come, more spacious is the room; the multitudes have gone.<br> <b>9. </b>If men could come unto the kingdom with their carnal thoughts, their passions and desires, there scarcely would be room for all.<br> <b>10. </b>But when they cannot take these through the narrow gate they turn away; the few are ready to go in and see the king.<br> <b>11. </b>Behold, John is a mighty fisher, fishing for the souls of men. He throws his great net out into the sea of human life; he draws it in and it is full.<br> <b>12. </b>But what a medley catch! a catch of crabs, and lobsters, sharks and creeping things, with now and then a fish of better kind.<br> <b>13. </b>Behold the thousands come to hear the Wild Man of the hills; they come in crowds that he may wash them in the crystal flood, and with their lips they do confess their sins.<br> <b>14. </b>But when the morrow comes we find them in their haunts of vice again, reviling John, and cursing God, and heaping insults on the king.<br> <b>15. </b>But blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the king.<br> <b>16. </b>And blessed are the strong in heart, for they shall not be cast about by every wind that blows;<br> <b>17. </b>But while the fickle and the thoughtless have gone back to Egypt land for leeks and carnal herbs to satisfy their appetites, the pure in heart have found the king.<br> <b>18. </b>But even those whose faith is weak, and who are naught but carnal manifests, will some day come again, and enter in with joy to see the king.<br> <b>19. </b>O men of Israel, take heed to what this prophet has to say! Be strong in mind; be pure in heart; be vigilant in helpfulness; the kingdom is at hand.<br> <b>20. </b>When Jesus had thus said he went his way, and with his six disciples came to Bethany; and they abode with Lazarus many days.</p>
