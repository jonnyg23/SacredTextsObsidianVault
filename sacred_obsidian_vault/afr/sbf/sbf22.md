 <h1 align="CENTER">THE MASON WASP<small>[1]</small> AND HIS WIFE.</h1>
 <p>The Mason Wasp<small>[2]</small> formerly did thus as he walked along, while (his) wife walked behind him, the wife said: "O my husband! Shoot for me that hare!" And the Mason Wasp laid down his quiver; the Mason Wasp said: "Where is the hare? And (his) wife said: The hare lies there."</p>
 <p>And the Mason Wasp took out an arrow; the Mason Wasp in this manner went stooping along.<small>[3]</small> And the wife said: "Put down (thy) kaross! Why is it that thou art not willing to put down (thy) kaross?" Therefore, the Mason Wasp, walking along, unloosened the strings of the kaross; he put down the kaross. Therefore the wife said: "Canst thou be like this?<small>[4]</small> This must have been why thou wert not willing to lay down the kaross."</p>
 <p>Therefore, the Mason Wasp walked, turning to one side; he aimed at (his) wife, he shot, hitting the (head of) the arrow on (his) wife's breast<small>[5]</small> (bone).</p>
 <p><small>[1. The Mason Wasp resembles the <i>Palpares</i> and <i>Libellula</i>. It has a small body. The Mason Wasp flies, and is to be seen in summer near water; <i>|hang#kass'o</i> has seen it in our garden at Mowbray. it is rather smaller than the <i>Palpares</i> and <i>Libellula</i>.</small></p>
 <p>2. He was formerly a man; therefore, he had a bow; therefore, he shot his wife, when he had not shot the hare.</p>
 <p>3. We are accustomed to go along stooping, when we wish that the hare may quietly lie hidden (knowing that people are at hand; lying still, thinking that it will be passed by).</p>
 <p>4. She mocked at the man on account of the middle of the man's body, which was slender; hence she mocked at the man.</p>
 <p>5. <i>i.e.</i> breaking her breastbone.]</p>
 <p>And (his) wife fell down dead on account of it. Then he exclaimed: "<i>Yi ii hihi</i>! O my wife <i>hi</i>!" (crying) as if he had not been the one to shoot (his) wife. He cried, that he should have done thus, have shot his wife; his wife died.</p>
