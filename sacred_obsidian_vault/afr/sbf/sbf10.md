 <h1 align="CENTER">THE GREAT STAR, !GAUNU, WHICH, SINGING, NAMED THE STARS.</h1>
 <i></i><p>!gaunu,<small>[1]</small> he was formerly a great Star; therefore, his name is <i>!gaunu</i>; while he feels that he was the one who formerly spoke (lit. "called") the Stars' names; while he feels that he is a great one. Therefore, he called the Stars' names. Therefore, the Stars possess their names; while they feel that <i>!gaunu</i> was the one who called their names. He formerly sang, while he uttered the Stars' names. He said "<i>||Xwahai</i>"<small>[2]</small> to (some) Stars which are very small; they are those of which he made <i>||Xwhai</i>; their small, fine ones are those which are <i>||Xwhai.</i></p>
 <p><small>[1. My (paternal) grandfather, <i>|Xugen-ddi</i>, was the one who told me star's stories."</small></p>
 <p>2. The stars <i>||Xwahai |aiti</i> and <i>||Xwhai-@pua</i> were identified as "Altair" or "Alpha Aquilae", and "Gamma Aquilae", respectively, by the late Mr. George Maclear and Mr. Finlay of the Royal Observatory, on October 10, 1873, at Mowbray. <i>||Xwhai gwai</i> was behind a tree and too low to be distinguished.]</p>
 <p>Therefore, the porcupine, when these Stars have, sitting, turned back, he will not remain on the hunting ground; for, he knows that it is dawn, when <i>||Xwhai</i> has, lying, turned back. He returns home; for, he is used to look at these Stars; they are those which he watches; while he feels that he knows that the dawn's Stars they are.</p>
