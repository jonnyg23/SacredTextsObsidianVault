 <h1 align="CENTER">HOW TTO IS OBTAINED.</h1>
 <i></i><p>Tto is in the mountain, the <i>tto</i> mine; the people say that the <i>tto</i> mine is on the side of the mountain, the people say '<i>tto</i> mine' to it.</p>
 <p>The people are afraid of it <small>[that is, of the sorcerers who live by the mine]</small>, because the people are aware that people are there (sorcerers). They (the sorcerers) make a house<small>[1]</small> there. Therefore, the people who intend to pound <i>tto</i>, rub themselves when they (go to) collect <i>tto</i>. And when they go to the <i>tto</i>, they throw stones at the <i>tto</i> mine, when they wish the sorcerers to bide themselves, that they may go undisturbed to work at the <i>tto</i>, while they feel that the sorcerers dwell at the <i>tto</i> mine. Therefore, they take up stones, they throw stones at the <i>tto</i> mine, when they wish the sorcerers to hide themselves, that they may go in peace<small>[2]</small> to work at the <i>tto</i>. And they go to work at the <i>tto</i>, <i>tto</i>, <i>tto</i>. They also get <i>||hara</i>;<small>[3]</small> they put away the <i>||hara</i> and the <i>tto</i>, and they return home.</p>
 <p><small>[1. The narrator thinks that their houses are small holes, like mouse-holes.</small></p>
 <p>2. For, they would be ill, if the sorcerers saw them.</p>
 <p>3. The <i>||hara</i> mine <small>[literally, "mouth" or "opening "]</small> is in a different place; the <i>tto</i> mine is also in a different place.]</p>
