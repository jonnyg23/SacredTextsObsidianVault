 <h1 align="CENTER">TREATMENT OF BONES BY THE NARRATOR'S GRANDFATHER, TSATSI.</h1>
 <p>Thus my grandfather (Tsatsi) was one who put away (in the sticks of the hut) the upper bones of the fore leg, and the shoulder blades, and the springbok's <i>||khurken</i>; because the first finger (of our right hand) is apt to get a wound when we are shooting, if the dogs eat the springboks' <i>||khu||khuruken</i>, our first finger has a wound; we do not know how to manage with it, when we pull the string as we are shooting.</p>
 <p>Therefore, we sew our first finger into a cover(?) (it is skin which has been rubbed and made soft), which the wife cuts out, she sews it for us; we put our finger into it; and then we pull the (bow-) string, while we feel that our finger is inside. We are shooting, when we lie in wait for the springbok. Then it is that our finger gets a wound, when we shoot, lying in the screen of bushes, while the springbok come up to us as we lie, because the springbok are not a little numerous, when we have gone by night (among them, making a shelter behind which to shoot). Therefore, this male springbok, he comes out from this place, he walks, coming up to us, we shall shoot (him). He runs away, he goes to lie down (to die), while we lie inside the screen of bushes which we have made.</p>
