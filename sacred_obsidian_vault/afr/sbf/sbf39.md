 <h1 align="CENTER">THE BROKEN STRING.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">People were those who<br>
 Broke for me the string.<br>
 Therefore,<br>
 The place became like this to me,<br>
 On account of it,<br>
 Because the string was that which broke for me.<small>[1]</small><br>
 Therefore,<br>
 The place does not feel to me,<br>
 As the place used to feel to me,<br>
 On account of it.<br>
 For,<br>
 The place feels as if it stood open before me,<br>
 Because the string has broken for me.<br>
 Therefore,<br>
 The place does not feel pleasant to me,<br>
 On account of it.</p>
 <p>The above is a lament, sung by <i>Xaa-tting</i> after the death of his friend, the magician and rain-maker <i>!nuing|kui-ten</i>; who died from the effects of a shot he received when going about, by night, in the form of a lion.</p>
 <p><small>[1. Now that "the string is broken", the former "ringing sound in the sky" is no longer heard by the singer, as it had been in the magician's lifetime.]</small></p>
