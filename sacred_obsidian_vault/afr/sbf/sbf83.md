 <h1 align="CENTER">3. |XUE AS A ||GUI TREE AND AS A FLY.</h1>
 <p>The sun set, and <i>|Xue</i> was <i>|Xue</i>, and lay upon the ground, and slept, was alone, and lay upon the ground and slept. And the sun rose, and <i>|Xue</i> awoke and . . . and stood up, and saw the sun,--a little sun,--and was <i>||gui</i>, and was a tree.</p>
 <p>And his wife saw the <i>||gui</i>, and went to the <i>||gui</i>, and went to take hold of a <i>|gui</i> fruit, and the <i>||gui</i> vanished; and <i>|Xue</i> was a fly. And his wife laid herself upon the earth, and cried about the <i>|gui</i>, and died. And <i>|Xue</i> was a fly, and settled upon the grass.<small>[1]</small> And his wife lay down upon the earth, and cried about the <i>||gui</i><small>[2]</small></p>
 <p><small>[1. And he settled upon the grass, and the grass broke. The name of the grass is <i>goo</i>.</small></p>
 <p>2. The <i>||gui</i> is a tree. People eat the <i>||gui</i>, the<i>||gui</i> fruit. People do not put the <i>||gui</i> into a pot, but eat it raw. The <i>||gui</i> has thorns.]</p>
