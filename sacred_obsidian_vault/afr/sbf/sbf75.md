 <h1 align="CENTER">||HARA AND TTO.</h1>
 <i></i><p>||hara<small>[1]</small> is black; the people <small>[having mixed it with fat]</small> anoint their heads with it; while <i>tto</i> is red, and the people rub their bodies with it, when they have pounded it; they pound it, pound it, pound it, they rub their bodies with it. They pound <i>||hara</i>, they anoint their heads, when they have first</p>
 <p><small>[1. A certain stone which is said to be both hard and soft.]</small></p>
 <p>pounded the <i>tto</i>; they first rub their bodies with <i>tto</i>. And they pound <i>||hara,</i> they anoint their heads. They anoint their heads very nicely, while they wish that their head's hair may descend (i.e., grow long). And it becomes abundant on account of it; because they have anointed their heads, wishing that the hair may grow downwards, that their heads may become black with blackness, while their heads are not a little black.</p>
 <p>And they return, when they come away from the other man, while they return to their home; when they have told the other person (the woman) about it, that the other person shall prepare <small>[More]</small> <i>||hara</i> for them, as well as <i>tto</i>. For he (the man) also goes, (his) wife will go to dress bags for him, bags which he will also bring to the other man; while the other (man's wife) will also put aside <i>||hara</i> for him, when the other (man) collects <i>||hara</i>. And the other (man) comes to put aside <i>||hara</i> for him; while she <small>[the wife of the man who brought the bags]</small> also dresses (and) puts away bags for the other; for, she has told the other (woman) that the other must also bring her <i>||hara</i> and <i>tto</i>; for she has been to the other, and she will not be coming (soon again) to the other, for, the other must go to her; the other must go to receive the bags, when the other takes <i>tto</i> to her. Therefore, the other one also does so; she takes to the other <i>tto</i> and <i>||hara</i>.</p>
 <i></i><p>||hara sparkles; therefore, our heads shimmer, on account of it; while they feel that they sparkle, they shimmer. Therefore, the Bushmen are wont to say, when the old women are talking there: "That man, he is a handsome young man, on account of his head, which is surpassingly beautiful with the <i>||</i>hara's blackness." They say, "Handsome young man" to him, "His head is surpassingly beautiful; for, his head is like the <i>!khi</i> tree.<small>[1]</small></p>
 <p>It is a tree which is in our country; it is the <i>!khi</i> tree; it is large; (it) is a great tree. They are not a little abundant in our country: the <i>||Ukerri</i> tree and the <i>khi</i>.</p>
 <p><small>[1. The <i>!khi</i> tree bears berries; and has no thorns.]</small></p>
