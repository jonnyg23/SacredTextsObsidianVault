 <h1 align="CENTER">THE JACKAL'S HEART NOT TO BE EATEN.</h1>
 <p>They (the Bushmen) feel that a little child is wont to be timid; therefore, the little child does not eat jackals' hearts; because the jackal is not a little afraid; for the jackal runs away.</p>
 <p>The leopard is the one whose heart the little child eats; it which is not afraid; for, a little child becomes a coward from the jackal's heart, it fears immoderately (?).</p>
 <p>Therefore, we do not give to a little child the jackal's heart; because we feel that the jackal is used to run away, when it has not (even) seen us; when it has only heard our foot rustle, it runs away, while it does not look towards (us).</p>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Note added by the Narrator.</p>
 <p>He (my grandfather, <i>Tssatssi</i>) had bought dogs from <i>|gappem-ttu</i>, and <i>|gappem-ttu</i> gave him a dog. And he took hold of the dog, he tied the dog up; and he took the dog away; holding the thong with which he had tied up the dog. He at first kept the dog tied up; and, when the dog had slipped his thong(?), he put it upon the scent(?), and the dog killed jackals.</p>
 <p>He (my grandfather) skinned the jackals; and my grandmothers dressed the jackals' skins; they dressed them, they sewed them.</p>
 <p>He again(?) killed(?) a jackal and an <i>Olocyon Lalandii</i>, he brought them (home), he skinned them.</p>
 <p>And he made a kaross for <i>|gappem-ttu</i>, a jackals' kaross, while he put on the <i>Otocyon</i> kaross, the <i>Otocyon</i> skin.</p>
 <p>And he took the kaross to <i>|gappem-ttu</i>, the jackals' kaross, while he felt that <i>|gappem-ttu</i> was the one who had given him the dog. Therefore, he made a kaross for i<i>|gappem-ttu</i>; while be made for <i>|gappem-ttu</i> an equivalent(?) for the dog; therefore, he gave the kaross to <i>|gappem-ttu</i>, and <i>|gappem-ttu</i> also gave him a pot, while he rewarded (?) my grandfather for the jackals' kaross. And my grandfather returned home.</p>
 <p>Then my grandfather used to act in this manner, when he was boiling a jackal, he said: "Thou dost seem to think that we eat jackals' hearts? for, we become cowards (if we do so)." Therefore, we did not eat the jackals' hearts.</p>
 <p>For, my grandfather used not to eat the jackal; he only boiled the jackal for his sons.</p>
