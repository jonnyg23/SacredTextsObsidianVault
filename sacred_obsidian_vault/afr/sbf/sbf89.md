 <h1 align="CENTER">SNAKES, LIZARDS, AND A CERTAIN SMALL ANTELOPE, WHEN SEEN NEAR GRAVES, TO BE RESPECTED.</h1>
 <p>A snake which is near a grave, we do not kill, for, (it) is our other person, our dead person, the dead person's snake.<small>[1]</small> And we do not kill (it); for (we) respect it. And (if, during) many days, we see it, we do not kill (it); looking (at it), (we) let it alone.</p>
 <p>Another day, (if) we see a lizard, we follow the lizard's spoor; (if) the lizard has gone to the earth (grave?) of our other person, we respect the lizard, (we) do not kill the lizard, (we) let the lizard alone.</p>
 <p>(When) we see an antelope,<small>[2]</small> an antelope (which is) near our other person's place, that place where our other person has died, we respect the antelope; for, the antelope is not a mere antelope. Its legs(?) seem(?) small, it is the person who has died, and is a spirit antelope. It is a male antelope; it is not a female antelope.</p>
 <p><small>[1. (When) our "other one", (who) is a man, dies, he becomes (?) a snake; and his snake is a spirit. A snake bites him, he dies, he is a snake.</small></p>
 <p>When a woman just dies, the woman has no snake. If a snake bites a woman, (and) the woman dies, the woman is a snake. If a woman merely dies, her sprit is a mere spirit.</p>
 <p>When a man dies, his "other" is a mere spirit; his "other" is a snake; near his earth (grave?); and his mere spirit goes away.</p>
 <p>If an elephant kills him, (he) becomes (?) one kind of snake; (he) is a <i>#ne-ko</i>, and is black; he is not a different kind of snake; for his heart aches.</p>
 <p>2. At the Cape Town Museum, a very small kind of buck (the name of which the Curator did not know) was recognized as the <i>|ou</i> by my informants. It had been, I believe, brought from Damaraland or its neighbourhood.</p>
 <p>With regard to the above belief, it may also be mentioned that, on one occasion, I saw a snake close to the coping of a burial place; and showed it to <i>!nanni</i>, expecting him to destroy it. He merely looked at it in rather a strange way, and allowed it to depart uninjured; saying something about its being near a grave; which, at the time, I did not clearly understand--ED.]</p>
