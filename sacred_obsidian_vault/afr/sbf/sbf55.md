 <h1 align="CENTER">||KABBO'S JOURNEY IN THE RAILWAY TRAIN.<small>[1]</small></h1>
 <p>I have said to thee that the train (fire wagon) is nice. I sat nicely in the train. We two sat in (it), we (I) and a black man.</p>
 <p>A woman did seize my arm; she drew me inside, because I should have fallen, therefore she drew me in. I sat beside a black man; his face was black; his mouth (was) also black; for they are black.</p>
 <p>White men are those whose faces are red, for they are handsome. The black man he is ugly, thus his mouth is black, for his face is black.</p>
 <p>The black man then asked me: "Where dost thou come from?" I said to the black man: "I come from this place." The black man asked me: "What is its name?" I said to the blackman: "My place is the Bitterpits."</p>
