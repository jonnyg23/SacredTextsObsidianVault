 <p>The wild animals, it is said, were once assembled at Lion's. When Lion was asleep, Jackal persuaded Little Fox to twist a rope of ostrich sinews, in order to play Lion a trick. They took ostrich sinews, twisted them, and fastened the rope to Lion's tail, and the other end of the rope they tied to a shrub. When Lion awoke, and saw that he was tied up, he became angry, and called the animals together. When they had assembled, Lion said (using this form of conjuration)--</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>"What child of his mother and father's love,<br> Whose mother and father's love has tied me? "</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Then answered the animal to whom the question was first put--</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>I, child of my mother and father's love,<br> I, mother and father's love, I have not done it.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>All answered the same; but when he asked Little Fox, Little Fox said--</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>I, child of my mother and father's love,<br> I, mother and father's love, have tied thee!</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Then Lion tore the rope made of sinews, and ran after Little Fox. But Jackal said:</p> 
 <p>"My boy, thou son of lean Mrs. Fox, thou wilt never be caught."</p> 
 <p>Truly Lion was thus beaten in running by Little Fox.</p>
