 <p>THE Sun, it is said, was one day on earth, and the men who were travelling saw him sitting by the wayside, but passed him without notice. Jackal, however, who came after them, and also sitting, went to him and said, "Such a fine little child is left behind by the men." He then took Sun up, and put it into this awa-skin (on his back). When it burnt him, he said, "Get down," and shook himself; but Sun stuck fast to his back, and burnt Jackal's back black from that day.</p>
