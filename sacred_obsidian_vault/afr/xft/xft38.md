 <p>In the above story Kenkebe is represented as the personification of selfish greed. In this character his name has passed into a common proverb-</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>Sibayeni sonke, Kenkebe.<br> We are all bridegrooms, Kenkebm</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>This saying is used to any one who does not readily share food with others. It means, we are all entitled to a portion, you greedy one. A Kaffir, when eating, commonly shares his food with any others who may be present at the time.</p>
