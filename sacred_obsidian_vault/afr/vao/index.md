 This companion book to
 <a href="../ppj/index.htm">Psychic Phenomena of Jamaica</a> goes into
 much greater depth as to the New World-African connection,
 and adds more material about Afro-Carribean religion in Haiti.
 The primary strength of this work is the careful documentation
 of the history and ethnography of Vodun.
 Williams includes numerous quotes from rare documents and books on the subject.
 The weakness is the lack of detailed information about
 the religious system of Vodun, which we now know to be
 as complicated (or more so) than any of the major religions.
 There is scarcely any mention of the loas, the pantheon of Vodun Gods
 and Goddesses, and he misses the importance of possession
 during the religious ceremonies.
 However, all things considered, this is required reading if you want
 to understand the background of Haitian and Jamaican Vodun, and
 the profound influence of imperialism, slavery and racism
 on its development.--jbh.
