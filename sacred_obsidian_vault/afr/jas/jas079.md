 <p>So as this girl was courting by Juggin Straw Blue, his mother was an Old Witch too. And the courtyer's mother waked him up and gave him eight eggs; for the Old Witch man has seven heads and seven eggs, and each egg is for one of the Old Witch head. Well, the boy went after the Old Witch man and overtake him and mash one of the egg, and day light. And he cut off one of the head. An' the Old Witch man mash one of <b><i>his</i></b> egg and night came back. An' the boy mash the next one of his, and day light again; an' the Old Witch man mash one of his egg and night come back again. And so they went on that way until the boy mash seven egg and cut off the Old Witch seven heads and take away his girl. And he went home with his girl and marry.</p>
