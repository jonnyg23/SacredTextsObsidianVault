 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">79. Juggin Straw Blue.</h3>
 <p>The story is confused in the telling. It has three parts. (1) A water-being helps a girl who is abused by her aunt and sent to fetch water with too heavy a jug. (2) The water-being pursues and carries off the girl, though she is locked in an iron chest. (3) The girl's lover comes to her rescue and defeats the monster. See the next number and perhaps 99.</p>
