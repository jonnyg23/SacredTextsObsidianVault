 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">61. The Fasting Trial.</h3>
 <p>See number 149, where the bird in the tree starves and Hopping {p. 262} Dick on the ground picks up worms and wins the match. In this story, though incomplete, it is intimated that the bird in the tree wins,</p>
 <p>Compare Dayrell, 153-155; Harris, Nights, 370-373; Fortier, 34-37; Parsons, Andros Island, 97 99.</p>
 <p>In Dayrell, the birds propose to starve seven days to see which will be king. One leaves a hole out of which he creeps unobserved to feed.</p>
 <p>In Harris, as in this Jamaica version, the winning bird takes up his station in the tree; the "fool bud" stays down by the creek.</p>
 <p>In Parsons, one bird chooses a fruit tree, the other a "dry" tree. The song sung by the winning bird runs,--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"This day Monday mornin'<br>
     Tama tama tam!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>and so on for the remaining days of the week.</p>
 <p>In Fortier, the lady-love brings food to her favorite bird. The cooing song in the Jamaica versions suggests this connection.</p>
