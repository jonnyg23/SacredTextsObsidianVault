 <p>De boy, being an ol' witch, know dat it was de debbil. He tol' de mudder not to allow his sister to marry to de man, for de man is de debbil. De mudder said, "Go 'way, sah! what you know? You can call a gentleman like dat de debbil?" So when de debbil walking, his knee sing a song like ringing a bell. It go like dis:</p><dir>

 Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing,<br>
 Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing,<br>

 </dir>
 
 <p>De boy overhear de debbil knee singing. But, now, anybody else sing de song, de debbil clo'es will drop off, a horn grow on head, an' tail grow out on him too. So one night while he was in de house talking, de little boy was underneat' de table singing de song quietly:</p><dir>
