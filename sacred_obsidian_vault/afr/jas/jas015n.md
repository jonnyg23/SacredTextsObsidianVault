 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">15. Long Shirt.</h3>
 <p>Hendrick's version of this good story is the only one I heard in Jamaica. It has a European coloring in the speaking garment, which resembles the English versions of Jack and the Bean-stalk. The setting of the dance resembles number 4, but in this story the dance plays no motivating part. For the horn as stump see Aesop, Phaedrus 2:8. The conclusion is no doubt a turn of Hendrick's own, as he was fond of explanatory endings and got one in whenever he could.</p>
