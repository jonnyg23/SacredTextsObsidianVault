 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">92. and 93. Hidden Names; Anansi and Mr. Able.</h3>
 <p>These two numbers are closely related to number 69. The plot turns upon tricks to discover a hidden name. The only difference between them is that in one story it is possession of one or more girls' names, in the next, that of a person whose name the girls alone know, upon which the plot depends. All the variants play upon the idea of concealing a listener to surprise the keeper of the secret (invariably girls) into betraying each other. See Jekyll, 11-13, where the king and queen kill themselves, as in number 93, when they hear the girls' names sung.</p>
 <p>Compare Barker, 45-49; Dayrell, 79-80; Dennet, 35-38; Parsons, Andros Island, 117.</p>
 <p>In Dayrell, Tortoise gets the wives to call out the husband's name in fright, and he is so ashamed when he hears it that he takes to the water.</p>
 <p>In Barker, Anansi drops down bananas sweetened with honey to the girls and they call to each other in surprise.</p>
