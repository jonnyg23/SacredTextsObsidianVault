 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">146. The Cumbalo.</h3>
 <p>Sarah Findley was an old-time negress who lived in a little hut far out in the bush. She danced to the song with a queer jumping motion like boys playing leap-frog and with all the agility of a young girl. The dance as a wake game is performed upon two parallel bars held by four men. One informant called it dancing "Calimbe."</p>
