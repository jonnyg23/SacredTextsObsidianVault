 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SHEPHERD'S COMMAND BY ATHLYI</h1>
 <p>First: Let all literature for the instruction of Athlyian's children be of a constructive nature looking towards Ethiopia.</p>
 <p>Second: Let the eye of a star be the eye of the Shepherd and the ear of a star be the ear of the Shepherd, for they are his stars.</p>
 <p>Third: Fight for that which is yours and ye shall obtain it, for there is nothing hard against the power of God.</p>
