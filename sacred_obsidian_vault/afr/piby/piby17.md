 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GUIDING LIGHT</h3>
 <p>Now when Athlyi started for Newark, there appeared a spotlight on the sleeve of his coat.</p>
 <p>When Athlyi saw the light he tried to cover it with his hat but the light could not be covered.</p>
 <p>Then he looked up and yelled joyfully, "It's the light of the Lord.</p>
 <p>"Surely it cannot be covered. The light of the Lord our God I shall follow this day. Indeed I will not stray."</p>
 <p>Athlyi journeyed to Newark and the light with him. But when he turned contrary to the will of God, the light would not follow but stood on another street.</p>
 <p>Now when Athlyi saw the light would not go, he turned and went the way the light pointed him.</p>
 <p>And it came to pass when Athlyi reached the City of Newark he prepared a house for the Lord our God and when he was making ready for the first sermon, a little girl opened the door and stared plumply into his face and uttered "Gaathly?" "Is your name Gaathly?" the shepherd <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> asked. The child then raised her voice and again said "Gaathly," and went out.</p>
 <p>Straightway a light flashed and Athlyi looked around. He beheld over the altar a hand, writing on the wall the name Gaathly.</p>
 <p>When Athlyi saw the hand on the wall he became very fearful but embroiled with joy.</p>
 <p>He then rushed into the inner chamber and proclaimed before his wife Miriam and his daughter Muriel, the name of Gaathly saying, "Behold a hand wrote it and the child revealed it as the Lord had promised."</p>
 <p>From that day unto this the Holy House founded upon the Gospel of God through Athlyi is known as the Gaathly.</p>
