 Oíbo I have told you of the days<br>
 When Odudúwa and Orísha fought;<br>

 Strange legends also. . . Now in the age when mirth<br>

 <td>Obálufon—for while his lesser wives<br>
 Proudly bore many sons unto their lord,<br>
 A daughter only, young Adétoún,<br>
 Was granted to his queen. And as the years<br>
 Lagged by, a strangeness which he always seemed<br>
 To keep in hiding chequered the fair day<br>
 With doubtings, and waylaid her in the paths<br>
 Of her fond nightly dreams. Once with the Spring,<br>
 She saw the clustered tree-tops breaking into leaf<br>
 Copper and red and every green, and she<br>
 Remembered how beneath the new year's buds<br>
 It was ordained by Peregún ’Gbo, lord<br>
 Of uninhabitable woods that Life<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 36------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a>
 
 Should spring from Forest, and Life from Life,—till all<br>
 The Woods were gladdened with the voice of beasts<br>
 And birds—and thus she reasoned: "Is it not told<br>
 How Peregún ’Gbo<a name="page_36_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_36_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> spoke, and from the womb<br>
 Of Forest leaped the sloth that laughs by night?<br>
 How 'mid the boughs the sloth brought forth the ape<br>
 That bore the leopard? And did not Peregún<br>
 Watch o'er the birth of young Orúnmila,<br>
 And ever, when the morrow's sorrowing dawn<br>
 Must yield up to the leaguing fiends the child's<br>
 Fair life, did not the watchful God send down<br>
 His messenger to stay the grasping hand<br>
 Of Death? Thus do the Gods; and surely one<br>
 Will give me sons. Ah! whom must I appease?"</td></tr>

 <td>     Quick with new hope Great Mórimi sought out<br>
 A priest of Ífa<a name="page_36_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_36_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> in his court yard dim,<br>
 Where from each beam and smoke-grimed pillar hung<br>
 The charms the wise man set to guard his home,<br>
 His wives and children from the ills contrived<br>

 By the bad spirits. To her gift she whispered,<br>
 And laid it on Okpéllè; and the priest<br>
 Seizing the charm of Ífa said: "Okpéllè,<br>
 To you the woe of Mórimi is known;<br>
 You only can reveal its secret cause,<br>
 Its unknown cure!" Then he laid down the charm<br>
 And Óffun Kánran stood before them. The face<br>
 Of Ífa's priest was troubled, and he said:</td></tr>

 <td>"Mórimi, this is the message of my lord<br>
 Ífa: a son, nay many sons, you long for.<br>
 You have a daughter, and your husband's love<br>
 Was yours. The Gods would give you many sons,<br>
 But in your path stands Éshu, the Undoer,<br>
 Whose shrine calls out for blood, for sacrifice:<br>
 Adétoún." Without hope Mórimi<br>
 Went forth, and loathing of the ways of the Gods<br>
 Possessed her—while indignation fed her love<br>
 Of her one child. . . .</td></tr>

 <td>And in the smiles of happier wives she read<br>
 A mockery; Moons faded from the sky,<br>

 Companions of her hours. At last she cried:<br>
 "But sons l asked for; I will go again<br>

 To conscious sin: "The forms of messengers<br>
 Reveal the thoughts of Ífa, and the ears<br>
 Of Ífa, the God-Messenger, have heard<br>
 The far-off, thundrous voice. Would you hold back?<br>
 Is not the birth of Nations the first law<br>
 Arámfè gave? Can any wife withstand<br>
 His will, or maid stern Ógun's call?<a name="page_38_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_38_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> To-day<br>

 The green shoots greet the Spring-rain and forget<br>
 The barren months, and Mórimi shall know<br>
 Her grief and her reproach no more." Then doubt<br>

 Seized Mórimi but still she answered; "Will Gods<br>
 Not give? Is the grim World a morning market<br>
 Where they drive bargains with the folk they made?<br>
 Are babes as bangles which Obálufon<br>
 Fashions to barter?" But Édi answered her:<br>
 "But once Arámfè spoke to Odudúwa,<br>
 And with what heavy hearts the Gods went forth<br>
 From Heaven's valleys to the blackness! Now thrice,<a name="page_39_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_39_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Thrice to the woman Mórimi the word<br>
 Has come—with promise of the World's desire:<br>
 Not every wife is chosen for the mother<br>
 Of a house of kings. And think!—Obálufon!"<br>

 In darkness; and with the dawn a young girl lay</td></tr>
