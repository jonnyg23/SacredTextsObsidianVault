 <td>     Forgotten lives were lived, and shadowy priests<br>
 Kept warm the altars of the departed Gods:<br>
 Old men went softly to the River's lip<a name="page_46_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_46_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Unsung: 'twixt hope and fear mute colonists<br>
 Went forth to the strange forests of the World;<br>
 And unremembered wives sought out the shrines<br>
 Of the givers of new life. Their names are lost. . .<br>
  <br>
      Yet now, Oíbo, let a final tale<br>
 Be told; for, at the last, that silent age<br>
 Yields up the legend of its fall. In those<br>
 Last tranquil years the mothers blessed King Ógun<br>
 For peaceful days and night's security;<br>
 And old men used to tell of their brave deeds<br>
 In battles where Orányan led, applaud<br>
 The torch-lit dance and pass their last calm days<br>
 Happily. . . But then came traders from the wilds<br>

 By thorn and tangle of scarce-trodden ways<br>
 Through the dim woods with wondrous tales they heard<br>
 At crossway markets<a name="page_47_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_47_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> in far lands of deeds<br>
 Orányan did on battlefields beyond<br>
 The region of the forests. These tales, oft-told<br>
 In house and market, filled the air with rumours<br>
 And dreams of war which troubled the repose<br>
 Of ancient Ífè—for, while the fathers feared<br>
 The coming of the day when the grey God,<br>
 Aweary of Earth's Kingship, would go back<br>
 To his first far-off home, the young men's dreams<br>
 Were always of Orányan, and their pale days</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><i>Orányan<br>returns<br>from<br>distant<br>Wars to<br>demand the<br>crown.</i></td>
 <td>Lagged by. . . Such were the various thoughts of men<br>
 In Ífè, when on a clay, unheralded,<br>
 Orányan<a name="page_47_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_47_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> with a host appeared before<br>
 Her peaceful gates. None could deny his entrance:<br>
 The hero strode again the streets he saved<br>
 From the Olúbo's grass-clad men, and came<br>
 Before his father to demand the crown<br>
 Of Odudúwa. King Ógun spoke: "My son,<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 48------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a>
 
 'Tis long since you were here, and you are welcome.<br>
 But why with these armed men do you recall<br>
 Times well-forgotten and the ancient wars?<br>
 This is a land of peace: beneath the shade<br>
 Of Ífè's trees the mirth of Heaven's vales<br>
 Has found a home, the chorus and the dance<br>
 Their measure. Lay by your arms, and may no hurt<br>
 Attend your coming or your restful hours!"<br>
 Harshly Orányan answered his old father:<br>
 "You speak of peace, Great Ógun, and the calm<br>
 Arámfè destined for a World to be.<br>
 Arámfè spoke—and Odudúwa's dream<br>
 Of wisdom linked to supreme power begat<br>
 A theft!<a name="page_48_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_48_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> And that same night on Heaven's rim<br>
 Devised another destiny for men.<br>
 What Heaven-sent art has Ógun to undo<br>
 That deed, and bid the still-born live? Besides,<br>
 Who taught the peaceful peoples of the World<br>
 Their longing for red War? Who forged their weapons—<br>
 With steel Arámfè gave for harvesting?<br>
 Who slew young maids who would not wed to bear<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 49------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a>
 
 More sons for ancient wars? Who, pray, but Ógun,<br>
 The God of War? . . What then? 'Tis said: 'The field<br>
 The father sowed his son shall reap!'"<a name="page_49_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_49_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> And Ógun<br>
 Made answer: "The story of my life has been<br>
 As the succeeding seasons in the course<br>
 Where Óshun pours her stream. First, long ago,<br>
 The sunny months of heaven when I roamed<br>
 A careless boy upon the mountains; then,<br>
 As a whole season when the boisterous storms<br>
 Fill full the crag-strewn bed with racing waters,<br>
 And the warm Sun is hidden by the clouds,<br>
 Doom brought me journeys, toils in darkness, wars<br>
 And yet more wars. Again the barren months<br>
 Are here: the wagtail lights upon the rock<br>
 The river hid; a lazy trickle moves<br>
 And in my age Arámfè's promised peace<br>
 Gives back her stolen happiness to Ífè. . . .<br>
 And now, the sage Osányi<a name="page_49_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_49_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> is no more,<br>
 His charms forgotten: I cannot turn to stone<br>
 And vanish like Odúwa; I cannot cast<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 50------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a>
 
 My worn old body down to rise instead<br>
 A river of the land, as Óshun did.<br>
 No, Earth must hold me, glad or desolate,<br>
 A King or outcast in the vague forest,<br>
 Till Heaven call me—when the locked pools bask,<br>
 And Óshun sleeps. . . Till then I ask to be<br>
 In peace; and, with my tale of days accomplished,<br>
 My last arts taught, Arámfè's bidding done—<br>
 I, the lone God on Earth who knows fair Heaven,<br>
 And the calm life the Father bade us give<br>
 To men,—I, Ógun, will make way, and go<br>
 Upon the road I came." But Orányan said:<br>
 "Let the first Mistress of the World decide.<br>
 These years the kingly power has passed away<br>
 From the old sleeping town Odúwa built<br>
 To me, Orányan, battling in far lands<br>
 Where no voice spoke of Ífè. Let Ífè choose<br>
 Her way: obscurity or wide renown!"<br>
      A silence fell: the black clouds of the storm<br>
 Were overhanging human destiny;<br>
 The breathless pause before the loud wind's blast<br>
 Held all men speechless—though they seemed to heave</td></tr>

 For utterance. At length, Eléffon, the friend<br>
 Of Ógun, voiced the fond hopes of the old chiefs<br>
 Who feared Orányan and his coming day:<br>
 "Ours is the city of the shrines which guard<br>
 The spirits of the Gods, and all our ways<br>
 Are ordered by the Presences which haunt<br>
 The sacred precincts. The noise of war and tumult<br>
 Is far from those who dream beneath the trees<br>
 Of Ífè. There is another way of life:<br>
 The way of colonists. By God's command,<br>
 From this first breast the infant nations stray<br>
 To the utter marches of humanity.<br>
 Let them press onward, and let Orányan lead them<br>
 Till the far corners of the World be filled;<br>
 Let the unruly fall before their sword<br>
 Until the Law prevail. But let not Ífè<br>
 Swerve from the cool road of her destiny<br>
 For dreams of conquest; and let not Ógun leave<br>
 The roof, the evening firelight and the ways<br>
 Of men—to go forth to the naked woods."<br>
 And the old chiefs echoed: "Live with us yet, Oh, Ógun!<br>
 Reign on your stable throne." But murmurs rose</td></tr>

 From the young men—suppressed at first, then louder—<br>
 Until their leader, gaining courage, cried:<br>
 "Empty our life has been—while from far plains,<br>
 Vibrant with the romance, the living lustre,<br>
 Orányan's name bestows, great rumours came<br>
 To mock our laggard seasons; and each year<br>
 Mórimi's festival recalls alike<br>
 The hero's name and Ífè's greatness. Must<br>
 All Ífè slumber that the old may drowse?<br>
 No; we will have Orányan, and no other,<br>
 To be our King." And a loud cry went up<br>
 From his followers: "Orányan is our King!"<br>
 And in that cry King Ógun heard the doom<br>
 A chieftain of our day sees clear in eggs<a name="page_52_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_52_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Of fateful parrots in his inmost chamber:<br>
 The walls of his proud city (his old defence)<br>
 Can never more uphold a rule of iron<br>
 For victor treachery within. And wearily<br>
 He spoke his last sad words: "My boyhood scarce<br>
 Had ended on Arámfè's happy hills<br>

 When I came here with Odudúwa; with him,<br>
 Lovingly I watched this ancient city growing,<br>
 And planted the grand forests for a robe<br>
 For queenly Ífè. I have grown old with Ífè:<br>
 Sometimes I feel that Ógun did become<br>
 Ífè, and Ífè Ógun, with the still lapse</td></tr>

 <td>Of years. Yet she rejects me. Ah! my trees<br>
 Would be more kind, and to my trees I go."<br>
  <br>
      Dawn came; and Ógun stood upon a hill<br>
 To Westward, and turned to take a last farewell<br>
 Of his old queen of cities—but white and dense.<br>
 O'er harbouring woods and unremembering Ífè<br>
 A mist was laid and blotted all. . Beyond,<br>
 As islands from a morning sea, arose<br>
 Two lone grey hills; and Ógun dreamed he saw<br>
 Again those early days, an age gone by,<br>
 When he and Great Odúwa watched the Bird<br>
 Found those grand hills with magic sand,—bare slopes,<br>
 Yet born to smile. . . That vision paled: red-gold<br>
 Above grey clouds the Sun of yesterday<br>
 Climbed up—to shine on a new order. . So passed<br>
 Old Ógun from the land.</td></tr>
