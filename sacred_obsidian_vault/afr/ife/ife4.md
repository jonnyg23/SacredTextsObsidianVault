 <td><i>Arába speaks:</i><br>
 I am the voice of Ífa, messenger<br>
 Of all the Gods: to me the histories<br>
 Are known, and I will tell you of the days<br>
 Of the Descent. How Old Arámfè sent<br>
 The Gods from Heaven, and Odudúwa stole<br>
 The bag—my king has told you. . . For many a day<br>
 Across unwatered plains the Great Ones journeyed,<br>
 And sandy deserts—for such is the stern bar<br>
 Set by Arámfè 'twixt his smiling vales</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><i>The Gods<br>arrive at<br>the edge of<br>Heaven.</i></td>
 <td>And the stark cliff's edge which his sons approached<br>
 Tremblingly, till from the sandy brink they peered<br>
 Down the sheer precipice. Behind them lay<br>
 The parched, forbidding leagues; but yet the Sun<br>
 Was there, and breezes soft, and yet the mountains—<br>
 A faded line beyond the shimmering waste—<br>
 Called back to mind their ancient home. Beneath<br>
 Hung chaos—dank blackness and the threatening roar<br>
 Of untamed waters. Then Odudúwa spoke:<br>
 "Orísha, what did we? And what fault was ours?<br>
 Outcasts to-day; to-morrow we must seek<br>
 Our destiny in dungeons, and beneath<br>

 That yawning blackness we must found a city<br>
 For unborn men. Better a homeless life<br>
 In desert places: dare we turn and flee<br>
 To some lost valley of the hills? Orísha,<br>
 What think you?" Then spoke Orísha whom men call<br>
 The Great: "Is this Odúwa that I hear—<br>
 My mother's son who stole Arámfè's gift,<br>
 And thought to filch away the hearts of men<br>
 With blessings which were mine to give? For me,<br>
 The arts I know I long to use, and yearn<br>
 To see the first of toiling, living men<br>
 That I shall make. Forbidding is our task,<br>
 You say—but think, ere we return to peace<br>
 And Heaven's calm, how boundless is the fate<br>
 You flinch from! Besides, is Godhead blind?</td></tr>

 <td>For life await us: let us go." So spoke<br>
 Orísha; and Odúwa hung a chain<br>
 Over the cliff to the dark water's face,<br>
 And sent Ojúmu, the wise priest, to pour<br>
 The magic sand upon the sea and loose<br>

 Triumphant land.<a name="page_22_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_22_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> But, as Earth's ramparts grew,<br>
 Ever in the darkness came the waves and sucked<br>
 Away the crumbling shore, while foot by foot<br>
 Lagoons crept up, and turned to reedy swamps<br>
 The soil of hope. So Odudúwa called</td></tr>

 And thus he spoke: "Beneath, the waters wrestle<br>
 With the new-rising World, and would destroy<br>
 Our kingdom and undo Arámfè's will.<br>
 Go to the fields of men to be, the homes<br>
 That they shall make. Olókun! to the sea!<br>
 For there your rule and your dominion shall be:<br>
 To curb the hungry waves upon the coastlands<br>
 For ever. And thus, in our first queen of cities<br>
 And secret sanctuaries on lonely shores<br>
 Through every æon as the season comes,<br>
 Shall men bring gifts in homage to Olókun.<br>
 And you, Olóssa, where your ripple laps<br>
 The fruitful bank, shan see continually<br>
 The offerings of thankful men."</td></tr>

 <td>Beneath the Bird toiled on until the bounds,<br>
 The corners of the World were steadfast. And then<br>
 Odúwa called Orísha and the Gods<br>
 To the cliff's edge, and spoke these words of sorrow:<br>
 "We go to our sad kingdom. Such is the will<br>
 Of Old Arámfè: so let it be. But ere<br>
 The hour the wilderness which gapes for us<br>
 Engulf us utterly, ere the lingering sight<br>
 Of those loved hills can gladden us no more—<br>
 May we not dream awhile of smiling days<br>
 Gone by? . . Fair was drenched morning in the Sun<br>
 When dark the hill-tops rose o'er misty hollows;<br>
 Fair were the leafy trees of night beneath<br>
 The silvering Moon, and beautiful the wind<br>
 Upon the grasslands. Good-bye, ye plains we roamed.</td></tr>

 Cast on the crags of Heaven's blue hills. Ah! wine<br>

 The dirge of wasting hopes and the lament<br>
 Of a people in a strange World shuddering<br>
 Beneath the thunder of the unseen waves<br>
 On crumbling shores around. Always the marsh<br>
 Pressed eagerly on Ífè; but ever the Bird<br>
 Returned with the unconquerable sand<br>
 Ojúmu poured from his enchanted shell,<br>
 And the marsh yielded. Then young Ógun bade<br>
 The Forest grow her whispering trees—but she<br>
 Budded the pallid shoots of hopeless night,<br>
 And all was sorrow round the sodden town<br>
 Where Odudúwa reigned. Yet for live men</td></tr>

 Of Night, Olókun and Olóssa, and all<br>
 The wives of the great Gods bore babes with eyes<br>
 Of those born blind—unknowing of their want—<br>
 And limbs to feel the heartless wind which blew<br>
 From outer nowhere to the murk beyond. . .<br>
 But as the unconscious years wore by, Orísha,<br>
 The Creator, watched the unlit Dawn of Man<br>
 Wistfully—as one who follows the set flight<br>

 Beyond a marshy wilderness—and spoke<br>
 To Odudúwa: "Our day is endless night,<br>
 And deep, wan woods enclose our weeping children.<br>
 The Ocean menaces, chill winds moan through<br>
 Our mouldering homes. Our guardian Night, who spoke<br>
 To us with her strange sounds in the still hours<br>
 Of Heaven is here; yet she can but bewail<br>
 Her restless task. And where is Evening? Oh! where<br>
 Is Dawn?" He ceased, and Odudúwa sent<br>
 Ífa, the Messenger, to his old sire<br>
 To crave the Sun and the warm flame that lit<br>
 The torch of Heaven's Evening and the dance. . .</td></tr>

 The Father of the Gods, and he sent down<br>
 The vulture with red fire upon his head<br>
 For men; and, by the Gods' command, the bird<br>
 Still wears no plumage where those embers burned him—<br>
 A mark of honour for remembrance. Again<br>
 The Father spoke the word, and the pale Moon<br>
 Sought out the precincts of calm Night's retreat<br>

 Which cling to hillsides of the Dawn—to Eve<br>
 Who calls the happy toilers home.</td></tr>

 Had lifted from the unused eyes of men,<br>

 The use of iron, and wise Obálufon<a name="page_26_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_26_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Made brazen vessels and showed how wine streams out<br>
 From the slim palms.<a name="page_26_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_26_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> And in the night the Gods<br>
 Set torches in their thronging courts to light<br>
 The dance, and Heaven's music touched the drum<br>
 Once more as in its ancient home. And mirth<br>
 With Odudúwa reigned.</td></tr>
