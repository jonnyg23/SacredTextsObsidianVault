 <h2 align="center">VIII<br> THE IROKO TREE</h2>
 
 <p>I<small>N</small> the forest there is a giant tree called by the Yorubas the “Iroko,” which is shunned by all people, for in it lives the spirit of an old man who prowls about at night with a little torch and frightens travellers.</p>
 
 <p> Anyone who sees the Iroko-man face to face goes mad and speedily dies.</p>
 
 <p> Seeing the thick branches and mighty trunk of the Iroko, woodcutters are often tempted to cut the tree down and make use of the wood, but this is very unlucky, as it rouses the displeasure of the Iroko-man and brings misfortune on the woodcutter and all his family.</p>
 
 <p> In any house which contains furniture made of Iroko-wood, there can be heard at night strange groaning and creaking noises; it is the spirit of the Iroko, imprisoned in the wood, who longs to wander about again through the forest with his little torch.</p>
