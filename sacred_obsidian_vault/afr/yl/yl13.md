 <h2 align="center">XI<br> THE BAT</h2>
 
 <p>T<small>HE</small> Bat is half a bird and half a rodent, and lives partly on the earth and partly in the air, but both rats and birds shun him, and this is why:</p>
 
 <p> The rats, his cousins, were once fighting a great battle with the birds, and Bat fought in their midst.</p>
 
 <p> But when he saw that the birds were likely to be victorious, he left the rats and flew up into the air to fight on the side of the birds.</p>
 
 <p> Both the rats and the birds were disgusted at this cowardly action, so they ceased from fighting one another and all combined to attack the Bat.</p>
 
 <p> Since that day he has been forced to hide in dark places all day, and only comes out in the evening when his enemies cannot see him.</p>
