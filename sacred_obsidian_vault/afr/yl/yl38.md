 <h2 align="center">XXXV<br> THE THREE DEATHS OF TORTOISE</h2>
 
 <p>T<small>ORTOISE</small> had many enemies, and they plotted together to kill him.</p>
 
 <p> One night when Tortoise was asleep in his hut, they set fire to it, and as they saw the flames leaping up, they said to one another:</p>
 
 <p> “He cannot escape. He will die.”</p>
 
 <p> But Tortoise drew himself into his shell and was untouched by the fire, and in the morning his enemies were astonished to see him walking about as usual.</p>
 
 <p> Soon they made another plan and threw Tortoise into a pool of water.</p>
 
 <p> “The pool is deep. He will drown,” said his enemies to one another.</p>
 
 <p> But Tortoise had drawn himself into his shell and was secure, and at noon the sun shone fiercely and dried up the pool.</p>
 
 <p> That evening Tortoise walked about the village as if nothing had happened, and his enemies were astonished.</p>

 <p> The next day they made a third attempt to kill him. They made a deep hole in the ground and buried Tortoise, and this time they were quite sure he could not escape. To mark the place, they put a bamboo stake in the ground.</p>
 
 <p> Meanwhile a man who was passing saw the bamboo stake, and thought, “Someone has buried a treasure here!” He called his friends, and they began to dig, but all they found was Tortoise fast asleep inside his shell.</p>
 
 <p> Tortoise walked about the village again, looking very happy, and his enemies were filled with astonishment.</p>
 
 <p> “He has a charm, and we shall never be able to kill him,” they said to one another, and from that day they left him in peace.</p>
