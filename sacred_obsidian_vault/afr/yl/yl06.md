 <h2 align="center">IV<br> SONS OF STICKS</h2>
 
 <p>A <small>GREAT</small> King sent his various sons to rule over different parts of his kingdom, and all were satisfied but one, the youngest and most ambitious, who returned to his father after some time with the complaint that his territory was much too small and his subjects too few.</p>
 
 <p> The King was displeased with his son, and sent for a large bundle of sticks, which he converted into human beings.</p>
 
 <p> “Here are some more subjects for you!” he said to the astonished Prince.</p>
