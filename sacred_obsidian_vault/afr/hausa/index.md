 This is a collection of Hausa folklore, which is directly sourced from
 a Hausa storyteller, and translated by a European academic.
 This originally appeared as two volumes, the translation being in the first
 one.
 These West African stories, from what is today is Nigeria,
 are from an Islamic background,
 giving us a look into this important African storytelling tradition.
