 <p>The African Question is this, The Continent of Africa Proper is a National Woman.<br> She is that Rich National Woman that has Charmed the Men of Nations to Lie With Her.<br> AND AFTER A TIME WHEN THEY ALL HAVE LIVED AND COHABITED WITH HER THEY ALL BROKE HER DOWN &amp; LEAVE HER &amp; PERSECUTE HER.<br> That is just how all Nations manage to SOKE through the AFRICAN WOMANHOOD of Prosperity.</p>  
 <p>She had too much Sympathy for the perishing Nations, whose Lives are Riotously Lived until this day.<br> SLAVE TRADERS WENT INTO AFRICA AND DAMAGED her Seeds, beyond any EARTHLY CURE.</p>  
 <p>BECAUSE SHE HAD TOO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR WILFULL IDLERS of Various Nations. SO THEY WENT INTO HER AND ROBBED her Lands, Money, and took her seeds, to be slaves.</p>  
 <p>That to-day she and her children have no Power in Her own Land, nor ABROAD.</p>
