 <p>My dear Ethiopia, Creation Vast, is now Ethiopian Triumphant Dynasty.<br> The Ethiopian is the CROWN HEAD of this Earth Field since Heaven and Earth has been BUILT by the Living God.<br> Thank and Praise the Ever Living God, as long as Eternal Ages Roll.<br> We are your Parents, His and Her Triumphant Dynasty, King Alpha and Queen Omega, the Keepers of The TREE OF LIFE.<br> We are not any family at all to Adam and Eve and Abraham and Isaac, and the Anglo-Saxon Slave-Owners.</p>  
 <p>For that is exactly how His Majesty King Noah the Black Monarch was DROWN at Antediluvia by Adam-Abraham, THE ANARCHY.<br> Judge Samson lost his TRIBUNAL and his life by marrying the Philistine white woman. See Judges 14, 15 &amp; 16 Chapters.</p>  
 <p>See the Philistines Judges plotting out RIDDLES with the woman how to get him.</p>
