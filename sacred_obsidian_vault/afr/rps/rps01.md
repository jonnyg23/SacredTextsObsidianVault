 <p>My dear inhabitants of this world, we are the foundation stones of the resurrection of the Kingdom of Ethiopia.</p>  
 <p>Our prayers and labour for your resurrection is past finding out. No Library in this world is able to contain the work of our hands for you.</p>  
 <p>For we work day and night for your Deliverance.</p>  
 <p>As for this generation of the 20th Century, you have no knowledge how worlds are built.</p>  
 <p>And upon what trigger Kingdoms are set.</p>  
 <p>In my Encyclopedia I will explain to you all, how worlds are being built and what triggers Kingdoms are set on.</p>  
 <p>I will also explain to you, the Capacities of generations.</p>  
 <p>Speaking for the Universe, and the Womanhood of Man, I the Ethiopian woman, is the Crown woman of the world.</p>  
 <p>Without any apology, to any mortal that was ever created by King Alpha and Omega.</p>  
 <p>I hand you my Rule Book from the poles of Supreme Authority.</p>
