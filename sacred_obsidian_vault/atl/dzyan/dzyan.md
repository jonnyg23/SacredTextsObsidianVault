 <p>Nor Aught nor Nought existed; yon bright sky<br>
 Was not, nor heaven's broad roof outstretched above.<br>
 What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed?<br>
 Was it the water's fathomless abyss?<br>
 There was not death -- yet there was nought immortal,<br>
 There was no confine betwixt day and night;<br>
 The only One breathed breathless by itself,<br>
 Other than It there nothing since has been.<br>
 Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<br>
 In gloom profound -- an ocean without light --<br>
 The germ that still lay covered in the husk<br>
 Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat. </p>
 <p>. . . . . . . . </p>
 <p>Who knows the secret? who proclaimed it here?<br>
 Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang?<br>
 The Gods themselves came later into being --<br>
 Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?<br>
 That, whence all this great creation came,<br>
 Whether Its will created or was mute,<br>
 The Most High Seer that is in highest heaven,<br>
 He knows it -- or perchance even He knows not." </p>
 <p>"Gazing into eternity . . .<br>
 Ere the foundations of the earth were laid, </p>
 <p>. . . . . </p>
 <p>Thou wert. And when the subterranean flame<br>
 Shall burst its prison and devour the frame . . .<br>
 Thou shalt be still as Thou wert before<br>
 And knew no change, when time shall be no more.<br>
 Oh! endless thought, divine <strong>E</strong>TERNITY."</p>

 <h4>COSMIC EVOLUTION.</h4>
 <em><p>In Seven Stanzas translated from the Book of Dzyan. </p>
 </em><p>--------------------- </p>
 <h5>STANZA I.</h5>
 <p>1. <strong>T</strong>HE ETERNAL PARENT WRAPPED IN HER EVER INVISIBLE ROBES HAD SLUMBERED ONCE AGAIN FOR SEVEN ETERNITIES. </p>
 <p>2. <strong>T</strong>IME WAS NOT, FOR IT LAY ASLEEP IN THE INFINITE BOSOM OF DURATION. </p>
 <p>3. <strong>U</strong>NIVERSAL MIND WAS NOT, FOR THERE WERE NO <strong>A</strong>H-HI TO CONTAIN IT. </p>
 <p>4. <strong>T</strong>HE SEVEN WAYS TO BLISS WERE NOT. <strong>T</strong>HE GREAT CAUSES OF MISERY WERE NOT, FOR THERE WAS NO ONE TO PRODUCE AND GET ENSNARED BY THEM. </p>
 <p>5. <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS ALONE FILLED THE BOUNDLESS ALL, FOR FATHER, MOTHER AND SON WERE ONCE MORE ONE, AND THE SON HAD NOT AWAKENED YET FOR THE NEW WHEEL, AND HIS PILGRIMAGE THEREON. </p>
 <p>6. <strong>T</strong>HE SEVEN SUBLIME LORDS AND THE SEVEN TRUTHS HAD CEASED TO BE, AND THE <strong>U</strong>NIVERSE, THE SON OF <strong>N</strong>ECESSITY, WAS IMMERSED IN <strong>P</strong>ARANISHPANNA, TO BE OUTBREATHED BY THAT WHICH IS AND YET IS NOT. <strong>N</strong>AUGHT WAS. </p>
 <p>7. <strong>T</strong>HE CAUSES OF EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DONE AWAY WITH; THE VISIBLE THAT WAS, AND THE INVISIBLE THAT IS, RESTED IN ETERNAL NON-BEING -- THE ONE BEING. </p>
 <p>8. <strong>A</strong>LONE THE ONE FORM OF EXISTENCE STRETCHED BOUNDLESS, INFINITE, CAUSELESS, IN DREAMLESS SLEEP; AND LIFE PULSATED UNCONSCIOUS IN UNIVERSAL SPACE, THROUGHOUT THAT ALL-PRESENCE WHICH IS SENSED BY THE OPENED EYE OF THE <strong>D</strong>ANGMA. </p>
 <p>9. <strong>B</strong>UT WHERE WAS THE <strong>D</strong>ANGMA WHEN THE <strong>A</strong>LAYA OF THE UNIVERSE WAS IN <strong>P</strong>ARAMARTHA AND THE GREAT WHEEL WAS <strong>A</strong>NUPADAKA?</p>
 <p></p><hr>
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 28 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 <h5>STANZA II.</h5>
 <p>1. . . . <strong>W</strong>HERE WERE THE BUILDERS, THE LUMINOUS SONS OF <strong>M</strong>ANVANTARIC DAWN? . . . <strong>I</strong>N THE UNKNOWN DARKNESS IN THEIR <strong>A</strong>H-HI <strong>P</strong>ARANISHPANNA. THE PRODUCERS OF FORM FROM NO-FORM -- THE ROOT OF THE WORLD -- THE <strong>D</strong>EVAMATRI AND <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT, RESTED IN THE BLISS OF NON-BEING. </p>
 <p>2. . . . <strong>W</strong>HERE WAS SILENCE? <strong>W</strong>HERE THE EARS TO SENSE IT? <strong>N</strong>O, THERE WAS NEITHER SILENCE NOR SOUND; NAUGHT SAVE CEASELESS ETERNAL BREATH, WHICH KNOWS ITSELF NOT. </p>
 <p>3. <strong>T</strong>HE HOUR HAD NOT YET STRUCK; THE RAY HAD NOT YET FLASHED INTO THE <strong>G</strong>ERM; THE <strong>M</strong>ATRIPADMA HAD NOT YET SWOLLEN. </p>
 <p>4. <strong>H</strong>ER HEART HAD NOT YET OPENED FOR THE ONE RAY TO ENTER, THENCE TO FALL, AS THREE INTO FOUR, INTO THE LAP OF <strong>M</strong>AYA. </p>
 <p>5. <strong>T</strong>HE SEVEN SONS WERE NOT YET BORN FROM THE WEB OF LIGHT. <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS ALONE WAS FATHER-MOTHER, <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT; AND <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT WAS IN DARKNESS. </p>
 <p>6. <strong>T</strong>HESE TWO ARE THE <strong>G</strong>ERM, AND THE <strong>G</strong>ERM IS ONE. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>U</strong>NIVERSE WAS STILL CONCEALED IN THE <strong>D</strong>IVINE THOUGHT AND THE <strong>D</strong>IVINE BOSOM. . . . </p>
 <p>------- </p>
 <h5>STANZA III.</h5>
 <p>1. . . . <strong>T</strong>HE LAST VIBRATION OF THE SEVENTH ETERNITY THRILLS THROUGH INFINITUDE. <strong>T</strong>HE MOTHER SWELLS, EXPANDING FROM WITHIN WITHOUT, LIKE THE BUD OF THE LOTUS. </p>
 <p>2. <strong>T</strong>HE VIBRATION SWEEPS ALONG, TOUCHING WITH ITS SWIFT WING THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AND THE GERM THAT DWELLETH IN DARKNESS: <strong>T</strong>HE DARKNESS THAT BREATHES OVER THE SLUMBERING WATERS OF LIFE. . . </p>
 <p>3. <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS RADIATES LIGHT, AND LIGHT DROPS ONE SOLITARY RAY INTO THE MOTHER-DEEP. <strong>T</strong>HE RAY SHOOTS THROUGH THE VIRGIN EGG, THE RAY CAUSES THE ETERNAL EGG TO THRILL, AND DROP THE NON-ETERNAL GERM, WHICH CONDENSES INTO THE WORLD-EGG. </p>
 <p></p><hr>
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 29 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 <p>4. <strong>T</strong>HEN THE THREE FALL INTO THE FOUR. <strong>T</strong>HE RADIANT ESSENCE BECOMES SEVEN INSIDE, SEVEN OUTSIDE. <strong>T</strong>HE LUMINOUS EGG, WHICH IN ITSELF IS THREE, CURDLES AND SPREADS IN MILK-WHITE CURDS THROUGHOUT THE DEPTHS OF MOTHER, THE ROOT THAT GROWS IN THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN OF LIFE. </p>
 <p>5. <strong>T</strong>HE ROOT REMAINS, THE LIGHT REMAINS, THE CURDS REMAIN, AND STILL <strong>O</strong>EAOHOO IS ONE. </p>
 <p>6. <strong>T</strong>HE ROOT OF LIFE WAS IN EVERY DROP OF THE OCEAN OF IMMORTALITY, AND THE OCEAN WAS RADIANT LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRE, AND HEAT, AND MOTION. <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS VANISHED AND WAS NO MORE; IT DISAPPEARED IN ITS OWN ESSENCE, THE BODY OF FIRE AND WATER, OR FATHER AND MOTHER. </p>
 <p>7. <strong>B</strong>EHOLD, OH <strong>L</strong>ANOO! <strong>T</strong>HE RADIANT CHILD OF THE TWO, THE UNPARALLELED REFULGENT GLORY: <strong>B</strong>RIGHT <strong>S</strong>PACE <strong>S</strong>ON OF <strong>D</strong>ARK <strong>S</strong>PACE, WHICH EMERGES FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT DARK WATERS. <strong>I</strong>T IS <strong>O</strong>EAOHOO THE YOUNGER, THE * * * <strong>H</strong>E SHINES FORTH AS THE SON; HE IS THE BLAZING <strong>D</strong>IVINE <strong>D</strong>RAGON OF <strong>W</strong>ISDOM; THE <strong>O</strong>NE IS <strong>F</strong>OUR, AND <strong>F</strong>OUR TAKES TO ITSELF <strong>T</strong>HREE,** AND THE <strong>U</strong>NION PRODUCES THE <strong>S</strong>APTA, IN WHOM ARE THE SEVEN WHICH BECOME THE <strong>T</strong>RIDASA (OR THE HOSTS AND THE MULTITUDES). <strong>B</strong>EHOLD HIM LIFTING THE VEIL AND UNFURLING IT FROM EAST TO WEST. <strong>H</strong>E SHUTS OUT THE ABOVE, AND LEAVES THE BELOW TO BE SEEN AS THE GREAT ILLUSION. <strong>H</strong>E MARKS THE PLACES FOR THE SHINING ONES, AND TURNS THE UPPER INTO A SHORELESS SEA OF FIRE, AND THE ONE MANIFESTED INTO THE GREAT WATERS. </p>
 <p>8. <strong>W</strong>HERE WAS THE GERM AND WHERE WAS NOW DARKNESS? <strong>W</strong>HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF THE FLAME THAT BURNS IN THY LAMP, OH <strong>L</strong>ANOO? <strong>T</strong>HE GERM IS THAT, AND THAT IS LIGHT, THE WHITE BRILLIANT SON OF THE DARK HIDDEN FATHER. </p>
 <p>9. <strong>L</strong>IGHT IS COLD FLAME, AND FLAME IS FIRE, AND FIRE PRODUCES HEAT, WHICH YIELDS WATER: THE WATER OF LIFE IN THE GREAT MOTHER. </p>
 <p>10. <strong>F</strong>ATHER-<strong>M</strong>OTHER SPIN A WEB WHOSE UPPER END IS FASTENED TO SPIRIT -- THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DARKNESS -- AND THE LOWER ONE TO ITS SHADOWY END, MATTER; AND THIS WEB IS THE UNIVERSE SPUN OUT OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES MADE IN ONE, WHICH IS <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT. </p>

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 30 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 <p>11. <strong>I</strong>T EXPANDS WHEN THE BREATH OF FIRE IS UPON IT; IT CONTRACTS WHEN THE BREATH OF THE MOTHER TOUCHES IT. <strong>T</strong>HEN THE SONS DISSOCIATE AND SCATTER, TO RETURN INTO THEIR MOTHER'S BOSOM AT THE END OF THE GREAT DAY, AND RE-BECOME ONE WITH HER; WHEN IT IS COOLING IT BECOMES RADIANT, AND THE SONS EXPAND AND CONTRACT THROUGH THEIR OWN SELVES AND HEARTS; THEY EMBRACE INFINITUDE. </p>
 <p>12. <strong>T</strong>HEN <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT SENDS <strong>F</strong>OHAT TO HARDEN THE ATOMS. <strong>E</strong>ACH IS A PART OF THE WEB. <strong>R</strong>EFLECTING THE "<strong>S</strong>ELF-<strong>E</strong>XISTENT <strong>L</strong>ORD" LIKE A MIRROR, EACH BECOMES IN TURN A WORLD. </p>
 <p>------- </p>
 <h5>STANZA IV.</h5>
 <p>1. . . . <strong>L</strong>ISTEN, YE <strong>S</strong>ONS OF THE <strong>E</strong>ARTH, TO YOUR INSTRUCTORS -- THE <strong>S</strong>ONS OF THE <strong>F</strong>IRE. <strong>L</strong>EARN, THERE IS NEITHER FIRST NOR LAST, FOR ALL IS ONE: NUMBER ISSUED FROM NO NUMBER. </p>
 <p>2. <strong>L</strong>EARN WHAT WE WHO DESCEND FROM THE <strong>P</strong>RIMORDIAL <strong>S</strong>EVEN, WE WHO ARE BORN FROM THE <strong>P</strong>RIMORDIAL <strong>F</strong>LAME, HAVE LEARNT FROM OUR FATHERS. . . . </p>
 <p>3. <strong>F</strong>ROM THE EFFULGENCY OF LIGHT -- THE RAY OF THE EVER-DARKNESS -- SPRUNG IN SPACE THE RE-AWAKENED ENERGIES; THE ONE FROM THE EGG, THE SIX, AND THE FIVE. <strong>T</strong>HEN THE THREE, THE ONE, THE FOUR, THE ONE, THE FIVE -- THE TWICE SEVEN THE SUM TOTAL. <strong>A</strong>ND THESE ARE THE ESSENCES, THE FLAMES, THE ELEMENTS, THE BUILDERS, THE NUMBERS, THE ARUPA, THE RUPA, AND THE FORCE OF <strong>D</strong>IVINE <strong>M</strong>AN -- THE SUM TOTAL. AND FROM THE DIVINE MAN EMANATED THE FORMS, THE SPARKS, THE SACRED ANIMALS, AND THE MESSENGERS OF THE SACRED FATHERS WITHIN THE HOLY FOUR. </p>
 <p>4. <strong>T</strong>HIS WAS THE ARMY OF THE VOICE -- THE DIVINE MOTHER OF THE SEVEN. <strong>T</strong>HE SPARKS OF THE SEVEN ARE SUBJECT TO, AND THE SERVANTS OF, THE FIRST, THE SECOND, THE THIRD, THE FOURTH, THE FIFTH, THE SIXTH, AND THE SEVENTH OF THE SEVEN. <strong>T</strong>HESE "SPARKS" ARE CALLED SPHERES, TRIANGLES, CUBES, LINES, AND MODELLERS; FOR THUS STANDS THE <strong>E</strong>TERNAL <strong>N</strong>IDANA -- THE <strong>O</strong>EAOHOO, WHICH IS:</p>

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 31 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 <p>5. "<strong>D</strong>ARKNESS" THE BOUNDLESS, OR THE NO-NUMBER, <strong>A</strong>DI-<strong>N</strong>IDANA <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT: -- </p>
 <blockquote>I. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>A</strong>DI-<strong>S</strong>ANAT, THE NUMBER, FOR HE IS ONE. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>II. <strong>T</strong>HE VOICE OF THE <strong>L</strong>ORD <strong>S</strong>VABHAVAT, THE NUMBERS, FOR HE IS ONE AND NINE. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>III. <strong>T</strong>HE "FORMLESS SQUARE." </blockquote>
 <strong><p>A</p></strong>ND THESE THREE ENCLOSED WITHIN THE <img src="sd1-4a.jpg" align="MIDDLE">ARE THE SACRED FOUR; AND THE TEN ARE THE ARUPA UNIVERSE. <strong>T</strong>HEN COME THE "SONS," THE SEVEN FIGHTERS, THE ONE, THE EIGHTH LEFT OUT, AND HIS BREATH WHICH IS THE LIGHT-MAKER. 
 <p>6. <strong>T</strong>HEN THE SECOND SEVEN, WHO ARE THE <strong>L</strong>IPIKA, PRODUCED BY THE THREE. <strong>T</strong>HE REJECTED SON IS ONE. <strong>T</strong>HE "<strong>S</strong>ON-SUNS" ARE COUNTLESS. </p>
 <p>------- </p>
 <h5>STANZA V.</h5>
 <p>1. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>P</strong>RIMORDIAL <strong>S</strong>EVEN, THE <strong>F</strong>IRST <strong>S</strong>EVEN <strong>B</strong>REATHS OF THE <strong>D</strong>RAGON OF <strong>W</strong>ISDOM, PRODUCE IN THEIR TURN FROM THEIR <strong>H</strong>OLY <strong>C</strong>IRCUMGYRATING <strong>B</strong>REATHS THE <strong>F</strong>IERY <strong>W</strong>HIRLWIND. </p>
 <p>2. <strong>T</strong>HEY MAKE OF HIM THE MESSENGER OF THEIR WILL. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>D</strong>ZYU BECOMES <strong>F</strong>OHAT, THE SWIFT SON OF THE <strong>D</strong>IVINE SONS WHOSE SONS ARE THE <strong>L</strong>IPIKA, RUNS CIRCULAR ERRANDS. <strong>F</strong>OHAT IS THE STEED AND THE THOUGHT IS THE RIDER. <strong>H</strong>E PASSES LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE FIERY CLOUDS; TAKES THREE, AND FIVE, AND SEVEN STRIDES THROUGH THE SEVEN REGIONS ABOVE, AND THE SEVEN BELOW. <strong>H</strong>E LIFTS HIS VOICE, AND CALLS THE INNUMERABLE SPARKS, AND JOINS THEM. </p>
 <p>3. <strong>H</strong>E IS THEIR GUIDING SPIRIT AND LEADER. <strong>W</strong>HEN HE COMMENCES WORK, HE SEPARATES THE SPARKS OF THE <strong>L</strong>OWER <strong>K</strong>INGDOM THAT FLOAT AND THRILL WITH JOY IN THEIR RADIANT DWELLINGS, AND FORMS THEREWITH THE GERMS OF WHEELS. <strong>H</strong>E PLACES THEM IN THE SIX DIRECTIONS OF SPACE, AND ONE IN THE MIDDLE -- THE CENTRAL WHEEL. </p>
 <p>4. <strong>F</strong>OHAT TRACES SPIRAL LINES TO UNITE THE SIXTH TO THE SEVENTH -- THE CROWN; AN ARMY OF THE <strong>S</strong>ONS OF <strong>L</strong>IGHT STANDS AT EACH ANGLE, AND THE <strong>L</strong>IPIKA IN THE MIDDLE WHEEL, <strong>T</strong>HEY SAY: <strong>T</strong>HIS IS GOOD, THE </p>
