They held that but One Substance existed, and but One Energy, the one being Incal externalized, and the other His Life in action in His Body. Applying this principle to their scientific work they accomplished through it aerial navigation without gas or sails,--circumnavigating the globe in a day--conveyance of sound with reflection of the sender--heat and power conduction to whatever distance without material connection, transmuted metals--obtained, by electrical action, water from the atmosphere. These, and many others, were in common use.
