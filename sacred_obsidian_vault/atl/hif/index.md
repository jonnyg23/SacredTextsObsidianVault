 <p>
 On October 20th, 1912, readers of the <i>New York American</i> were
 regaled with a startling and perhaps history-making story in a lavish
 two-page spread.
 Paul Schliemann, grandson of Heinrich Schliemann, the famous archeologist who
 excavated Mycenae and the legendary city of Troy, revealed that his grandfather
 on his deathbed produced a mysterious bequest for any of his heirs
 willing to devote their life to proving the existence of Atlantis.
 He claimed that he had spent years following up on this and now was about
 to produce actual physical evidence of the reality of the fabled lost
 continent.
 <i>Or was he....</i>
 </p>
 <p>
 The <i>New York American</i> was one of the
 newspapers started by William Randolph Hearst
 which spawned the term 'Yellow Journalism',
 the predecessor of such distinguished
 modern supermarket tabloids such as the <i>National Enquirer</i>.
 Hearst newspapers could be relied upon for banner headlines,
 sensational scoops, heart-tugging sob stories, and 
 yarns which skirted the boundaries of good taste, if not logic.
 So in context, this article, which has occasionally been cited as
 an actual contribution to the study of Atlantis, can be appreciated as
 merely a diversion on the level of the <i>Bat Boy</i> or 
 <i>Aliens in the Oval Office</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 And indeed, this turned out to be a flash-in-the-pan hoax.
 There was no follow-up book, and Paul Schliemann dropped out of sight
 as quickly as he emerged.
 The promised artifacts were never produced, and scholars who worked closely
 with Heinrich Schliemann confirmed that he had never demonstrated any interest
 in Atlantis whatsoever.</p>
 <p>
 A close read of this article
 reveals many howlers that even an armchair archeologist
 will spot instantly.
 For instance, "...a collection of objects excavated from
 Tiahuanaca, in Central America."
 He misspells Tiahuanaco, and it's in South America.
 Or how about "...engraved with a sentence in Phoenician hieroglyphics".
 The Phoenicians used a phonetic writing system, not hieroglyphs.
 And "the Egyptian and the American pyramids [were] covered with a thick coating
 of smooth and shining cement", which is completely untrue.
 <i>Some</i> of the Egyptian pyramids were originally covered with casing stones;
 none of the American pyramids were encased, let alone with cement. 
 And "In the records of the old Buddhistic Temple at Lhasa
 there is to be seen an ancient Chaldean inscription"; this
 is conceivable but unlikely; it would be like
 finding an illuminated Sanskrit manuscript in an Irish monastery.
 And so on...
 Whoever wrote this, they weren't an archeologist; it was probably
 one of the Hearst hacks.
 As a matter of fact, the writing is so pulp,
 the author (whoever he or she is) even apologizes halfway
 through for being over-dramatic.</p>
 <p>
 In any case, we hope you enjoy this for what it
 is--a wonderful piece of flim-flam, a slice of Americana.
