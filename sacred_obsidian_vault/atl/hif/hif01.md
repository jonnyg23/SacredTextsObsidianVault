 <p>A Reconstruction of the Lost Continent of Atlantis Made from Deep Sea Surveys by the United States Government. The Gulf Stream Ran About the Continent, Taking Exactly the Same Course as It Does Now, Turning East at the Banks of Newfoundland and Circling on its Way to Europe the Submerged Dolphin Ridge, Which is Evidently a Vestige of the Lost Atlantean Continent. The Concentric Ovals Show How the Great City of the Atlanteans Was Built, According to the Story Told by Plato. There were Three Rings of Canals and Two Zones of Land, Cut by Four Rivers. From This Island Continent, Destroyed Perhaps 20,000 Years Ago, Came All Civilization. Egypt Is Supposed to Have Been Settled by a Colony of Atlanteans, and Also Central and South America.</p>
