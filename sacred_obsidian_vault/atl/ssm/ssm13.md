 <h1 align="CENTER">THE TWIN SISTERS--RELIGION AND SCIENCE</h1>
 <p>IN the writings of the earth's <i>First Great Civilization</i> it is distinctly shown that the ancients considered religion and science as necessary one to the other. This is shown by their using the same symbols both for religion and science. These symbols, in the early days, were all <i>geometrical</i> figures.</p>
 <i></i><p>Pythagoras, on his return to Athens from Egypt, taught his pupils: "To honor numbers and <i>geometrical</i> designs with the name of God."</p>
 <p>Whence did these ancients get their geometrical designs of figures? And what induced them to use identically the same figures to teach both religion and science?</p>
 <p>On close examination and comparison I find that most of the geometrical figures used may be found in the shape and details of flowers, leaves, et cetera, as the following examples show:</p>
 <i></i><p>Fig. 1. The Daisy, a circle. Symbolizing the Sun and His Rays.</p>
 <i></i><p>Fig. 2. The Syringa, a square. Symbolizing the Sacred Four.</p>
 <i></i><p>Fig. 3. The Lily, a triangle and crossed triangles.</p>

 <i></i><p>Fig. 4. The Moonflower, a triangle surmounting a square.</p>
 <p>It appears to me irrefutable that the ancients borrowed their patterns of geometrical figures from flowers et cetera. These were nature's creations. Being nature's creations, the ancients did not theorize but followed along the lines laid down by the Creator. They accepted the <i>Divine Examples</i> and Laws to follow. In nature the ancient found the highest and finishing school for learning, which calls back a memory of the steps of an old Hindu temple at Lahar, where the, great Master said, referring to some wandering jungle minstrels who were playing at the foot of the steps, "Men call them prodigies. There are no prodigies. All things result from natural Laws."</p>
 <p>The Egyptians in their early days excelled in Music. "They constructed their instruments to copy the voices of nature."</p>
 <p>The old Rishi's parting words: "Go forth into the world, my son, and learn that which is written by nature."</p>
 <p>Papyrus Ani. Dated 1320 B. C.: "Behold is it not written in this roll? Read ye, if ye come in the days unborn, if the gods have given you the skill."</p>
 <p>The books from which the ancients learnt their lessons are with us today, and at our disposal. Will we learn to read them? Have the gods given us the skill? I shall answer. We have the power to attain the skill. It rests with ourselves to do so.</p>

 <p>I think the foregoing is sufficient to show that the First Great Civilization obtained its knowledge of religion, arts, and sciences, not by fostering grotesque ideas, mythical theories, theological mirages and mysterious technology, but by studying, copying and applying nature's object lessons that lay before it, and lessons which lie before us today in nature's school of which the Infinite One is the Head Master.</p>
 <p>Nature was created and built up on fundamental laws. These Divine Laws have been and are being fully expressed in created objects, all of which have been consistently followed throughout Time. They cannot be <a href="errata.htm#6">improved</a> upon by man because they are divine. Being divine, they are perfect.</p>
 <p>To represent religious and philosophic ideas and conceptions, even of the most abstract order, the ancients employed basic geometric forms as symbols. That they borrowed their knowledge of these geometric forms from natural objects--flowers, leaves and so forth--almost goes without saying. The four drawings of flowers by Viola de Gruchy which were shown at the beginning of this chapter, illustrate strikingly the manner in which the symbols of the ancients occur in nature.</p>
 <p>During the past twenty to thirty years, numerous scholars and naturalists have delved deeply into the study of nature's geometry, and with the aid of the light cast by their researches we are beginning to obtain a more just appreciation of the knowledge of the</p>

 <p>ancients and of the extent to which they made practical application of that knowledge in their works of art and science.</p>
 <p>A. H. Church (on the relation, of Phyllotaxis to Mechanical Laws), T. A. Cook (The Curves of Life) and D'Arcy W. Thompson (On Growth and Form) are but three of the many who have in this century contributed to the rapid development of morphology into an advanced science. And one of the most amazing and valuable results of their researches has been the discovery that the natural laws they reveal were not only understood by the ancients, but applied to an extent unheard of in this civilization of ours, which we too readily accept as the most advanced that has ever graced this earth.</p>
 <p>Floral symbols were frequently used by the ancients. Many of these floral symbolizations became myths simply because those of later date of the New Civilization did not comprehend the symbols of the ancients. Something had been forgotten or something was purposely changed for priestly purposes.</p>
 <p>As an example and applicable to this work I will quote from: <i>The Human Side of Plants</i> by Royal Dixon: "From the earliest history down to the present day, there have been races and individuals who believed implicitly in the spirituality of plants."</p>
 <p>"Spirituality is a condition of responsiveness to and membership in the universal spirit of the Creator. The Infinite Substance--God."</p>

 <p>"The old Greeks and the Romans gave to the trees and plants the spirits of gods and men: and many more in modern times have lavishly bestowed souls on plants as did Adamson, Bonnet, Hedwig, and Edward Smith--with Martins and Fechner in Germany defending these views and being very liberal in their supply of souls to plants."</p>
 <p>"Surely there is a suggestion of some existent truth, which should cause this universal interest and investigation into the possibility of plant spirituality."</p>
 <p>In commenting on the foregoing paragraph, I shall say that there is not only a "suggestion" but an "actual truth" which is shown in the ancient writings known and understood by the priesthoods 5,000 years ago and probably only half of that time.</p>
 <p>Originally nearly all of the prominent attributes of the Deity had several symbols, or perhaps it would be better to say more than one symbol. A principal symbol for each was either a flower or a tree. Flowers were given the preference for symbolizing Divine Forces and trees for lands and countries. Flowers were very popular to symbolize each of the Four Great Primary Forces. They were also called "the gods," being the command, desire, or will of the Creator. On a few occasions I have found them called "His executive children." These Forces have also prominent geometrical symbols. Take the geometrical symbol and place it on the floral symbol of the gods and it will be seen that the geometrical symbol is on the lines of the sacred flower.</p>

 <p>In the Greek and Roman myths, it is shown that the ancients used flowers as patterns for the designs of geometrical symbols. The flower was the foundation, the geometrical figure the superstructure: so that by using flowers as symbols for something divine it was quite consistent with the ancient teachings to call these flowers divine, with souls or spirits or whatever the inner self may be for:--The ancients were <i>not</i> referring to the flower itself but <i>to the divine attribute, which it represented in their minds</i>.</p>
 <p>We see this clearly illustrated by the Hindus, Egyptians, Mayas and other ancient peoples where they symbolize Mu the Motherland with a Lotus flower. Times without number, especially in the Egyptian writings, Mu is referred to as "the Lotus"--which was her floral symbol. In these cases, the Egyptians and the others did not refer to the flower, but to what it represented in their minds--<i>Mu, the Motherland</i>. Mu was symbolized as a tree, The Tree of Life.</p>
 <p>The bronze statue here drawn and analyzed by Miss de Gruchy is one of the most ancient bronzes in existence. It is more than 18,000 years old. Its basic design theme is the equilateral triangle, and the skill and rigid consistency with which the whole and its parts are made to adhere to that theme are remarkable.</p>
 <p>Is it only a coincidence that the triangle, symbol of Heaven, was employed in the design of this figure representing the Mother Goddess--Mu?</p>
 <p>We can take any of the ancient statues, carvings, pictures</p>
 <p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a></p>
 <p>and designs, found in either India, China, Mexico, Central America, Greece or any other of the old civilizations, and on test it will be found that they all have the foundation of their designs in the first of the Sacred Symbols, prominently the oldest four--the circle, the triangle, the square and the pentagon.</p>
 <p>My next and last example will relate to science pure and simple.</p>
 <p>We all know that our modern geometry has been handed down to us by Euclid, the ancient Greek. Euclid obtained his knowledge of geometry in Egypt. The Egyptians inherited it from their forefathers who came to Egypt from the Motherland. When the science was fully developed in the Motherland, it is hard to say. In India there are exhibits which show that it was perfected 35,000 years ago. And in the Sacred Writings of Mu 70,000 years old it is shown to be perfected. How far back beyond this last date it goes I do not know. Possibly 100,000 years or more. As examples in geometry I shall take one of Euclid's problems.</p>
 <p>First Book--Problem 1. "To describe an equilateral triangle upon a given finite straight line."</p>
 <p>The lines of this problem consist of the first two of the Sacred Symbols--the circle and the triangle.</p>
 <p>Euclid's works were only one of the dying embers of the earth's First Great Civilization.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of other examples might be given involving most of our modern sciences. I think, however, that the foregoing are all sufficient to prove my assertion </p>
 <p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a></p>
 <p>that during the time of the First Great Civilization which received its death blow with the destruction of Mu, Religion and Science were completely intertwined in their teachings.</p>

 <p>There can be no perfect religion without science: for science unfolds nature, and nature is the mouthpiece which unfolds the Creator and gives the proof of God.</p>
 <p>Confucious. 556 B. C.: "Does God speak? The four seasons hold their course, and all things continue to live and grow, yet, tell me, does God speak?"</p>
 <p>Were I called upon to deliver a sermon my text would be <i>Love</i>, that great <i>Divine Love</i> which rules the universe. There would be no hell with its fire of brimstone. For God never made a hell, it is only man's invention and the only hell is what man makes for himself.</p>

 <p>"A soul released finds nothing to affright<br>
 Save visions false, of terror, bred by creeds,<br>
 And deep remorse, that gnaws at evil deeds."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Love is eternal, hell never existed. With the great Divine Love implanted in the hearts of man all would be a great brotherhood of Love. This would end all discord, turmoils and wars among God's family. These turmoils are with us today, caused by greed, selfishness, envy, hatred, malice and distrust. These evils could not be bred or exist if all men were making spiritualism their primary object in life, and all men worshipped the Heavenly Father instead of Mammon.</p>
 <p>With the Divine Love supreme the lion and the lamb could lie down together. God Himself is all Love and is in control of the hearts of man. Without the great Divine Love chaos, with all of its attendent evils, must exist. Chaos reigns supreme throughout the world today. Where earthly love exists we see the reflection of the great Divine Love.</p>
 <p>Walking along the jungle paths of the Polynesian Islands one may meet a company of these children of the Sun. When passing they accost you with <i>Koaha-E</i>, which means, My love to you. They do not know our phrases, Good morning, or How do you do. They do not come in their language for our phrases are of modern civilization and their language comes down to them from the ancient, but while the words may have become altered the conception remains the same.</p>
 <p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a></p>
 <p>If you meet one of the f air daughters of the islands her <i>Koaha-E</i> does not invite a flirtation. It is an inherited form of greeting from her ancient forefathers of 12,000 years ago, the time that Mu, her Motherland, sank to form the bottom of the ocean that surrounds her, where the teachings of her forefathers were--Love God and Love One Another.</p>
 <p>The ancients in Mu were never taught to fear God. On the contrary, they were taught that the Heavenly Father was all Love and that He could therefore be approached with love and confidence. The ancient religion was based on this. The recent religious teachings have been the reverse of this in general. This condition certainly calls for attention and gives food for thought, that is, for those who are not too busy to think, and for those who are not too egotistical to think. Materialism is responsible for the present chaotic state of the world, if we can believe in the prophecy of Ra Mu at the time Mu was going down into the flames of the underneath. "You shall all die together with your servants and your riches, and from your ashes new nations shall arise. If they forget they are superior, not because of what they put on, but what they put out, a similar fate will befall them."</p>
 <p>For the past 12,000 years, since Ra Mu uttered these words, his prophecy has been carried out and will continue to be carried out to the end. How many empires have arisen during the past 12,000 years? Where are they? What has become of them? Why did they fall? <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>
 <p>They are gone according to the prophecy of Ra Mu. I now ask--what is going to become of our present civilization?</p>
 <p>One of the pearls from the teachings of my dear old friend, the Rishi, which he uttered during one of our conversations was: "My son, the brain of man is his storehouse for knowledge, but the holding capacity of this storehouse is limited. Therefore, never put anything into it that is not valuable for your spiritual progress, or that which is not absolutely necessary for the development and continuance of your material body to the end of this incarnation, in order to prepare for your entrance into the world beyond.</p>
 <p>"Learn and store the wisdom of the teachings of nature, for nature is the great school house for attaining wisdom, nature is God's voice speaking.</p>
 <p>"Materialism, generally, is not worth storing, only that which appertains to the elevation of your mind and soul, that which will raise you to a higher plane, thus preparing you for the continuance of your life in the world beyond, a step in your eternal life.</p>
 <p>"And remember, that when you enter the world beyond, you will leave all materialism behind. You can take nothing with you, nor will you remember anything about it, only Love you will remember, for Love, like your soul, is everlasting, it cannot die.</p>
 <p>"Approach the Heavenly Father with full confidence and love. His loving arms are always stretched out to welcome you. If you slip or fall by the way, yet</p>
 <p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a></p>
 <p>approach Him in confidence and penitence, He will forgive and welcome you because He, Himself, is all Love. The Great Master Jesus explained this in his parable about the return of the prodigal son where he said: 'Joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.'"</p>
 <p>Once again I ask--what is to be the end of this present civilization?</p>
