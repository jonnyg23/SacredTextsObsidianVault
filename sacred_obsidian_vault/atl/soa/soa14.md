 <h1 align="CENTER">The Sub-Races</h1>
 <p>The names of the different sub-races must first be given--</p>
 <p>1. Rmoahal.</p>
 <p>2. Tlavatli.</p>
 <p>3. Toltec.</p>
 <p>4. First Turanian.</p>
 <p>5. Original Semite.</p>
 <p>6. Akkadian.</p>
 <p>7. Mongolian.</p>
 <p>Some explanation is necessary as to the principle on which these names are chosen. Wherever modern ethnologists have discovered traces of one of these sub-races, or even identified a small part of one, the name they have given to it is used for the sake of simplicity, but in the case of the first two sub-races there are hardly any traces left for science to seize upon, so the names by which they called themselves have been adopted.</p>
