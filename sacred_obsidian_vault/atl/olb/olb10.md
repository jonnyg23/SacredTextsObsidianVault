 <p>1. If war breaks out, the mother sends her messengers to the king, who sends messengers to the Grevetmen to call the citizens to arms.</p>  
 <p>2. The Grevetmen call all the citizens together and decide how many men shall be sent.</p>

 <p>3. All the resolutions must immediately be sent to the mother by messengers and witnesses.</p>  
 <p>4. The mother considers all the resolutions and decides upon them, and with this the king as well as the people must be satisfied.</p>  
 <p>5. When in the field, the king consults only his superior officers, but three citizens of the mother must be present, without any voice. These citizens must send daily reports to the mother, that they may be sure nothing is done contrary to the counsels of Frya.</p>  
 <p>6. If the king wishes to do anything which his council opposes, he may not persist in it.</p>  
 <p>7. If an enemy appears unexpectedly, then the king's orders must be obeyed.</p>  
 <p>8. If the king is not present, the next to him takes command, and so on in succession according to rank.</p>  
 <p>9. If there is no leader present, one must be chosen.</p>  
 <p>10. If there is no time to choose, any one may come forward who feels himself capable of leading.</p>  
 <p>11. If a king has conquered a dangerous enemy, his successors may take his name after their own. The king may, if be wishes, choose an open piece of ground for a house and ground; the ground shall be enclosed, and may be so large that there shall be seven hundred steps to the boundary in all directions from the house.</p>  
 <p>12. His youngest son may inherit this, and that son's youngest son after him; then it shall return to the community.</p>
