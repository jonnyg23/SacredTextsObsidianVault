 In the 19th century, ascendant nationalism in Europe used
 local folklore and ancient legends to bolster a sense of identity.
 One curious example of this is the Oera Linda Book, a controversial
 manuscript, dated 1256, from the Frisian region of the Netherlands. 
 The Oera Linda book is today
 conventionally agreed to be a forgery, written during the mid-19th century.
 This is based on the paper which the manuscript is written on, as well as
 internal and linguistic evidence.
 </p>
 <p>
 Purporting to be an episodic chronicle of wars and migrations of the
 Frisian people,
 the Oera Linda Book describes events dated (very precisely)
 from 2194 BCE to 803 CE.
 The reference date is the submergence of 'Atland,'
 a lost land in the North Sea, which, according to the
 book, occurred in 2193 BCE.
 The book is peppered with descriptions of catastrophic earth changes,
 including volcanic eruptions, strange weather, and rapid sea level changes.
 This is intriguing because, even if a forgery, the Oera Linda Book
 predates the origin of the modern Atlantis craze, which began
 with Ignatius Donnelly's
 <a href="../ataw/index.htm">Atlantis, the Antediluvian World</a>,
 published in 1882.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Oera Linda Book also claims that Europe
 was ruled by a (mostly) peaceful, just matriarchy for most of its history,
 and that the Frisians invented writing.
 There is a dark side, too: parts of the Oera Linda Book have touches
 of bigotry and intolerance which will be galling to most modern readers.
 This mix of themes have led to a continued fascination with this text,
 regardless of its authenticity.

 <small>PRODUCTION NOTES:
 I was unable to obtain a printed copy of this edition, so I printed
 out and scanned back in a Google page image PDF, which does not give
 the best OCR yield.
 Hence there may still be OCR errors lurking in this text.
 I had to omit the parallel Frisian text on facing pages for technical reasons.
 Most of the footnotes in the body of the text had to be placed at an
 inferred position, as for the most part the footnotes refer to the Frisian
 text, not the English. For this reason
 the place name references in the footnotes
 are logically reversed.
 As far as I can tell, this is the first time that an unmodified transcript of
 this translation of the Oera Linda Book has appeared online.--J.B. Hare, January 29th, 2009.</small>
