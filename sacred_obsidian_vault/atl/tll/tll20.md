 <h3 align="CENTER">Great Cities and Statues.</h3>
 <p>During the later part of the sixth, and the seventh sub-race they learnt to build great cities. These appear to have been of cyclopean architecture, corresponding with the gigantic bodies of the race. The first cities were built on that extended mountainous region of the continent which included, as will be seen in the first map, the present Island of Madagascar. Another great city is described in the "Secret Doctrine" <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">1</font></a> as having been entirely built of blocks of lava. It lay some 30 miles west of the present Easter Island, and</p>

 <p>it was subsequently destroyed by a series of volcanic eruptions. The gigantic statues of Easter Island--measuring as most of them do about 27 feet in height by 8 feet across the shoulders--were probably intended to be representative not only of the features, but of the height of those who carved them, or it may be of their ancestors, for it was probably in the later ages of the Lemuro-Atlanteans that the statues were erected. It will be observed that by the second map period, the continent of which Faster Island formed a part had been broken up and Faster Island itself had become a comparatively small island, though of considerably greater dimensions than it retains to-day.</p>
 <p>Civilisations of comparative importance arose on different parts of the continent and the great islands where the inhabitants built cities and dwelt in settled communities, but large tribes who were also partially civilised continued to lead a nomadic and patriarchial life; while other parts of the land--in many cases the least accessible, as in our own times--were peopled by tribes of extremely low type.</p>
