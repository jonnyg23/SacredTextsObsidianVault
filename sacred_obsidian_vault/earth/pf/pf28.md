 <p><small><i>He is the god who sits in the centre, on the Navel of the Earth; and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind</i>.<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plato</span>.</small></p>  
 <p><small><i>But at the Navel of the Earth stands Agni, clothed in richest apparel</i>.Rig Veda.</small></p>  
 <p><small><i>To whom then will ye liken God? It is</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> <i>that sitteth upon the</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chug</span> <i>of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers</i>.<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Isaiah</span>.</small></p>  
 <p><small><i>After proceeding some distance we paused to take breath where the crowd was more dense and obstinate than usual: and I was seriously informed that this was the exact Navel of the Earth, and that these obstinate pilgrims were bowing and kissing it</i>.The Land and the Book.</small></p>

 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Students</span> of antiquity must often have marveled that in nearly every ancient literature they should encounter the strange expression "the Navel of the Earth." Still more unaccountable would it have seemed to them had they noticed how many ancient mythologies connect the cradle of the human race with this earth-navel. The advocates of the different sites which have been assigned to Eden have seldom, if ever, recognized the fact that no hypothesis on this subject can be considered acceptable which cannot account for this peculiar association of man's first home with some sort of natural centre of the earth. Assuming, however, that the human race began its history at the Pole, and that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>all traditional recollections of man's unfallen state were connected with a polar Eden, the mystery which otherwise envelops the subject immediately vanishes.</p>  
 <p>We have already seen that the term "navel" was anciently used in many languages for "centre," and that the Pole, or central point of the revolving constellations, was the "Navel of Heaven." But as to the celestial Pole there corresponds a terrestrial one, so it is only natural that to the term the "Navel of Heaven" there should be the corresponding expression the "Navel of the Earth."</p>  
 <p>Beginning with Christian traditions, let us make a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. There, in the portion belonging to the Greek Christians, we shall discover a round pillar, some two feet high, projecting from the marble pavement, but supporting nothing. If we inquire as to its purpose, we shall be informed that it is designed to mark the exact centre or "Navel" of the Earth? <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">1</font></a> Early pilgrims and chroniclers refer to this</p>

 <p>curious monument, but its antiquity no one knows. <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">1</font></a> As usually described, it is a monument of the geographical ignorance of those who placed it there, a proof that they supposed the edge of the "flat disk" of the earth to be everywhere equidistant from this stone. In reality, it is a monument of primeval astronomic and geographic science.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>To find the true symbolical and commemorative character of this pillar, we need to remind ourselves of a tendency ever present and active among men. We have already alluded to the scores of "Calvaries" which have been set apart in Roman Catholic lands, and hallowed as memorial mounts. Up the side of each leads a <i>Via dolorosa</i>, with its different "stations," each recalling to the mind, by sculptured reliefs or otherwise, one of the immortal incidents of the Passion. On the summit is the full crucifixion tableau,the Saviour hanging aloft upon the cross, between two crucified malefactors. The spear, the reed with the sponge, the hammer,all are there, sometimes the ladder also; and near by, the tomb wherein never man was laid. In the minds of the worshipers it is a holy place.</p>  
 <p>Even in our Protestant republic, on the shore of Lake Chautauqua, we have seen successfully carried out, in our own day, a complete reproduction of Palestine. Thousands have visited it to take object-lessons in Sacred Geography. From it these thousands have gained clearer ideas of the relative positions and bearings of Hermon and Tabor and Olivet, of Kedron and Cherith and the Jordan, of Nazareth and Hebron and the Holy City, than else they ever would have had. What here has been done for purposes of instruction has elsewhere and often upon a greater or smaller scale, been done for purposes of direct religious edification, and for the gratification of religious sentiment.</p>  
 <p>Now, just as Christians love to localize in their</p>  
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>own midst their "Holy Places," so the early nations of the world loved to create miniature reproductions of Eden, the fair and sacred country in which man dwelt in the holy morning hours of his existence. <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">1</font></a> The traditional temple architecture of many early religions was determined by this symbolical and commemorative motive. This was eminently true of the sacred architecture of the Babylonians, Egyptians, Hebrews, and Chinese. <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">2</font></a> Koeppen assures us that "every orthodoxly constructed Buddhist temple either is, or contains, a symbolical representation of the divine regions of Meru, and of the heaven of the gods, saints, and Buddhas, rising above it." <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">3</font></a> Lillie says, "The thirteen pyramidal layers at the top of every temple in Nepâl represent the thirteen unchangeable heavens of Amitâbha." <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">4</font></a> With what</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>astonishing elaboration this idea has sometimes been carried out may be seen in the Senbyoo temple in Mengoon, near the capital of Burmah. <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">1</font></a> That the natural features of the landscape were often utilized in producing these symbolic shrines and holy places is only what we should expect. "The Buddhists of Ceylon," as Obry states, "have endeavored to transform their central mountain, <i>Dêva-Kuta</i> (Peak of the Gods), into Meru, and to find four streams descending from its sides to correspond with the rivers of their Paradise." <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>Again, in the "rock-cut" temples of Ellora, we have, in like manner, a complete representation of the Paradise of Siva. Faber develops the evidence of this practice among the ancients with great fullness, and with respect to the Hindus and Buddhists says, "Each pagoda, each pyramid, each montiform 'high-place,' is invariably esteemed to be a copy of the holy hill Meru," the Hindu's Paradise. <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>From "Records of the Past," vol. x., p. 50, we see that the Egyptians had the same custom of building temples in such a manner that they should be symbolical of the abode of the gods. So in Greece and</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Rome the citadel mounts in their cities had quite as great religious as military significance. Lenormant, speaking of Rome and Olympia, remarks, "It is impossible not to note that the Capitoline was first of all the <i>Mount of Saturn</i>, and that the Roman archæologists established a complete affinity between the Capitoline and Mount Cronios in Olympia, from the standpoint of their traditions and religious origin (Dionysius Halicarn., i., 34). This Mount Cronios is, as it were, the <i>Omphalos</i> of the sacred city of Elis, the primitive centre of its worship. It sometimes receives the name Olympos." <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">1</font></a> Here is not only symbolism in general, but also a symbolism pointing to the Arctic Eden, already shown to be the primeval mount of Kronos, the <i>Omphalos</i> of the whole earth. <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now, as Jerusalem is one of the most ancient of the sacred cities of the world, and, at the same time, the one where the tradition of the primeval Paradise was preserved in its clearest and most historic form, it would be strange if, in all its long history, no king or priesthood had ever tried to enhance its attractiveness and sanctity by making it, or some part of it, symbolize Earth's earliest Holy Land, and commemorate man's earliest Theocracy. That the attempt</p>

 <p>

 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p>was made is beyond a doubt. To this day the visitor is shown the spot where, according to one tradition, Adam was created. <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">1</font></a> Not many feet away, under the custody of another religion, he finds the sacred rock-hewn grave in which at least the head of the first of men was buried. <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">2</font></a> In the little Gihon, the name of one of the Paradise rivers still lives. The miraculous virtue of the Pool of Bethsaida was ascribed in early Christian legend to its being in subterranean contact with the Tree of Life, which grew in the midst of Paradise. <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">3</font></a> Christ's cross was said to have been made of the wood of the same tree. The very name, Mount Sion, is a memorial one. The Talmudic account of "The Strength of the Hill of Sion" shows that the Palestinian mount was named after the heavenly one, and not <i>vice versa</i>, as commonly supposed. The true sacred name of the Holy City is, therefore, not Sion (though it is often called by the heavenly appellation also), but "Daughter of Sion." She is simply</p>

 <p>a copy, a miniature likeness, of the true mount and city of God "in the sides of the North." <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>So confident is Lenormant that Solomon and Hezekiah intentionally conformed their capital to the Paradisaic mount, and intentionally introduced in their public works features which should symbolize and commemorate peculiarities of Eden, that he uses the fact as an unanswerable argument against those imaginative critics who would place the composition of the second chapter of Genesis subsequent to the Babylonian exile. He says,</p>  
 <p>"Another proof, and a very decisive one in my opinion, of the high antiquity of the narrative of Genesis concerning Eden, and of the knowledge of it possessed by the Hebrews long before the Captivity, is the intentionso clearly proved by Ewaldto imitate 'the four rivers' which predominated in the works of Solomon and Hezekiah for the distribution of the waters of Jerusalem, which, in its turn, was considered as the <i>Umbilicus</i> of the Earth (Ezek. v. 5), in the double sense of centre of the inhabited regions and source of the rivers. The four streams which watered the town and the foot of its rampartsone of which was named Gihon (1 Kings i. 33, 38; 2 Chron. xxxii. 30, xxxiii. 14), like one of the Paradisaic riverswere, as Ewald has shown, reputed to issue through subterranean communications from the spring of fresh water situated beneath the Temple, the sacred source of life and purity to which the prophets (Joel iii. 18; Ezek. xlvii. 1-12; Zech. xiii. 1, xiv. 8; <i>cf</i>. Apoc. xxii. 1) attach a high symbolic value." <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234</font></a></p>  
 <p>In this citation, in addition to a strong assertion of the symbolical character of the topography and waterworks of Jerusalem, we have the location itself included in this symbolism. The city is said to have been the <i>Umbilicus</i> or Navel of the Earth, for, two reasons: first, because of its relation to surrounding countries; <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">1</font></a> and, second, because of its containing the source of the rivers. In our next chapter, this last reason will become more significant than even the writer intended. At present we will only add that the true philosophy of this symbolical centrality of Jerusalem is found in two facts: first, the Hebrews had a tradition that <i>primeval Eden was the Centre of the Earth:</i> <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">2</font></a> and, second, by styling Jerusalem the Navel of the Earth, as they did, it was symbolically all the more assimilated to the primitive Paradise which in so many other ways it sacredly commemorated.</p>  
 <p>Passing to the field of Hellenic tradition, we are told by all modern interpreters that the Greeks shared the "narrow conceit and ignorance of all ancient nations," and supposed their own land to occupy the middle of the "flat earth-disk." And because of certain expressions in Pindar and a passage in Pausanias, it is affirmed as a first principle in the geography of the ancient Greeks that Delphi was believed to be the exact topographical centre-point of the whole earth.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p>Such a representation is far from satisfactory. For while the term "<i>Omphalos</i> of the Earth" was undoubtedly applied in a sense to Delphi, it belonged to it only as the name Athens belongs to many a town thus designated in America. It had other and older topographical connections and associations. We find traces of the same title in connection with Olympos, with Ida, with Parnassos, with Ogygia, with Nyssa, with Mount Meros, with Delos, with Athens, with Crete, and even with Meroë. In the multiplicity of these localizations, the people seem to have lost the clue to the original significance of the conception, and to have contrived crude etymological myths of their own for the explanation of what seemed to then a remarkable designation. <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The moment we make the true original <i>Omphalos</i> of the Earth the North Pole, and invest it with sacred traditionary recollections of Eden life, all this confusion becomes clear. The "centre-stone" of Delphi, like the Omphalium of the Cretans, becomes merely a memorial shrine, an attempted copy of the great original. And if all the Olymps and Idas and Parnassos mounts were alike convenient reproductions and localizations of the one celestial mountain of the gods at the North Pole, what wonder if we find each of them in some way designated as the Centre of the Earth.</p>  
 <p>Homer's "<i>Omphalos</i> of the sea," Calypso's isle,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>  
 <p>has in like manner all the marks of a mythico-traditional north polar Eden. Its name, Ogygia, connects it with a far-off antediluvian antiquity. <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">1</font></a> It is situated in the far North, and Odysseus needs the blast of Boreas to bring him away from its shores on the homeward journey. Its queen, Calypso, is the daughter of Atlas; and Atlas proper station in Greek mythology, as elsewhere shown, is at the terrestrial Pole. Its beauty is Paradisaic, it being adorned with groves and "soft meadows of violets,"so beautiful, in fact, that "on beholding it even an Immortal would be seized with wonder and delight." <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">2</font></a> Finally, identifying the place beyond all question, we have the Eden "fountain," whose waters part into "four streams, flowing each in opposite directions." <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Mount Meros we have only the Greek form of Meru, as long ago shown by Creuzer. <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">4</font></a> The one is the Navel of the Earth for the same reason that the other is. Egyptian Meroë (in some Egyptian texts <i>Mer</i>, in Assyrian <i>Mirukh</i>, or <i>Mirukha</i>), the seat of the famous oracle of Jupiter Ammon, was possibly named from the same "World-mountain." This would explain the passage in Quintus Curtius, which has so troubled commentators, wherein the object which represented the divine being is described as resembling a "navel set in gems." <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> When the two doves of Zeus, flying from the two opposite ends of the world, determine the cosmic centralness of "Parnassos," it is of an antediluvian Parnassos that the myth is speaking. <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a> It is that mount on whose polar top we have already found the "<i>domicilium</i>" of Zeus.</p>  
 <p>Nonnos, in describing the symbolical <i>peplos</i> which Harmonia wove on the loom of Athene, says, "First she represented the earth with its <i>omphalos</i> in the centre; around the earth she spread out the sphere of heaven varied with the figures of the stars. . . . Lastly, along the exterior edge of the well-woven vestment she represented the Ocean in a circle." <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">2</font></a> That Delphi or the Phocian Parnassos is the <i>omphalos</i> here mentioned is far enough from credible. It is the Pole, and the manner in which the term is introduced shows that it was perfectly understood by every reader, and needed no explanation. The true shrine of Apollo was not at Delphi, but in that older earth-centre of which Plato speaks in the motto prefixed to this section. His real home is among "the Hyperboreans," in a land of almost perpetual light; and it is only upon annual visits that he comes to Delphi. <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">3</font></a> The remembrance of this fact would have</p>

 <p>helped the interpreters of Pindar out of more than one perplexity. <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">1</font></a> According to Hecatæus, Lêtô, the mother of Apollo and his sister Artemis, was born on an island in the Arctic Ocean, "beyond the North wind." Moreover, on this island inhabited by the Hyperboreans, Apollo is unceasingly worshiped in a huge round temple, in a city whose inhabitants are perpetually playing upon lyres and chanting to his praise. <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">2</font></a> So reports Diodorus (ii., 47); and herewith agrees the imaginary journey of Apollonius of Tyana,a namesake of Apollo,who tells of his journey far to the North of the Caucasus into the regions of the pious Hyperboreans, among whom he found a lofty sacred mountain, the <i>Omphalos</i> of the Earth. <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the Phædo we have a charming description of Plato's terrestrial Paradise. "In this fair region,"</p>

 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Socrates is made to say, "all things that growtrees and flowers and fruitare fairer than any here; and there are hills and stones in them smoother and more transparent and fairer in color than our highly-valued emeralds and sardonyxes and jaspers and other gems, which are but minute fragments of them: for there all the stones are like our precious stones, and fairer still. The temperament of their seasons is such that the inhabitants have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and hearing and smell and all the other senses in much greater perfection. And they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell, and they hear their voices, and receive their answers, and are conscious of them, and hold converse with them, and they see the sun, the moon, and the stars as they really are." <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>If we ask as to the location of this divinely beautiful abode, every indication of the text agrees with our hypothesis. It is right under the eye when the world is looked at from its summit, the Northern celestial pole. <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">2</font></a> Viewed from the standpoint of Greece and its neighbor lands it is "<i>above</i>,"it is "<i>the upper Earth</i>," the dazzling top of the "<i>round</i>" world. In it, moreover, is the Navel of the Earth, μεσογαία, inhabited by happy men.</p>  
 <p>If anything is needed to disprove the common notion that geographical ignorance and national self-esteem first governed the ancient peoples in locating in their own countries "navels" of the earth, it is furnished by what is, in all probability, the oldest epic in the world, that of Izdhubar, fragments of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p>which have survived in the oldest literature of Babylonia. These fragments show that the earliest inhabitants of the Tigro-Euphrates basin located "the Centre of the Earth," not in their own midst, but in a far-off land, of sacred associations, where "the holy house of the gods" is situated,a land "into the heart whereof man hath not penetrated;" a place underneath the "overshadowing world-tree," and beside the "full waters." <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">1</font></a> No description could more perfectly identify the spot with the Arctic Pole of ancient Asiatic mythology. Yet this testimony stands not alone; for in the fragment of another ancient text, translated by Sayce in "<i>Records of the Past</i>," we are told of a "dwelling" which "the gods created for "the first human beings,<font size="-1" color="green">"</font>a dwelling in which they "became great" and "increased in numbers," and the location of which is described in words exactly corresponding to those of Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Eddaic, and Aztec literature; namely, "in the Centre of the Earth." <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the Hindu Puranas we are told over and over that the earth is a sphere, and that Mount Meru is its Navel or Pole. <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">3</font></a> But the expression <i>nâbhi</i>, or "Navel" of the earth, is older than the Puranas, though the very meaning of Purana is "ancient." Like the term "Navel of Heaven," it occurs in the</p>

 <p>hymns of the earliest Veda. But where was the sacred shrine to which it was applied? It was no holy place in Bactria, or in the Punjâb. Nothing tends to locate it in India. On the other hand, the fifth verse of the one hundred and eighty-fifth hymn, mandala first, of the Rig Veda, seems most plainly to fix it at the North Pole. In this verse Night and Day are represented as twin sisters in the bosom of their parents Heaven and Earth; each bounding or limiting the other, but both kissing simultaneously the Nâbhi of the Earth. Now, everywhere upon earth, except in the polar regions, Night and Day seem ever to be pursuing and supplanting each other. They have no common ground. At the Poleand only therethey may be said, with locked arms, to spin round and round a common point, and unitedly to kiss it from the opposite sides. <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">1</font></a> This plainly is the meaning of the poet; and remembering all the legendary splendors of the polar mountain around which sun and moon are ever moving, we must pronounce the figure as beautiful as it is instructive. <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>In perfect accord herewith, we find the bard asking, in another hymn, where the Navel of the Earth is; and in doing it he associates it as closely as possible, not with some central home-shrine in his own land, but with the extreme "<i>End of the Earth</i>,"an expression used again and again, in ancient languages, for the Pole and its vicinity. <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Again, in another Vedic passage, the Navel of the Earth is located upon "the mountains," and this association points us to the North. <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">2</font></a> Still stronger evidence of its polar location is found in other hymns, where the supporting column of heaventhe Atlas pillar of Vedic cosmologyis described as standing in or upon the Navel of the Earth. <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Finally, so unmistakable is the Vedic teaching on this subject that a recent writer, after asserting with all his teachers that the cosmography of the Vedic bards was "embryonic," and their earth a "flat disk" overarched by a solid firmament, which was "soldered on to the edge of the disk at the horizon," nevertheless, later, in studying one of the cosmogonical hymns of Dīrghatamas, the son of Mamata, reaches the conclusion that the singer had knowledge both of the celestial and of the terrestrial Pole, and that, in seeking to answer the question as to <i>the</i> </p>

 <p>We have seen that, according to Old-Iranian tradition also, man was created in the "<i>central</i>" division of the earth.

 <p>Passing to Japan, it is curiously interesting to note that the Ainos, who are supposed to have been the first inhabitants, are believed to have come into the archipelago "from the North;" <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">1</font></a> that their heaven is on inaccessible mountain-tops in the same quarter; <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">2</font></a> and that their name, according to some authorities, etymologically signifies "<i>Offspring of the Centre</i>." <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">3</font></a> In burial, their dead are always so placed that when resurrected their faces will be set toward the lofty northern country from which their ancestors are believed to have come, and to which their spirits are believed to have returned. <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>Taking these facts in connection with those presented in chapter second of the preceding part, one can hardly evade the conclusion that, when Griffis informs us that the Japanese considered their country as lying at "the top of the world," and when others say that the Japanese once regarded their country as the "Centre of the World," <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">1</font></a> it is most probable that these writers have applied to the Japan of to-day ideas which originally belonged to a far-distant prehistoric polar Japan, the primitive seat of the race, as it has lived on in these most ancient traditions of the Ainos.</p>  
 <p>In Scandinavian mythology we meet with a similar idea. In the Eddas, both Asgard and Idavollr are represented as in "the Centre of the World;" and at least one author, in explaining the reason of it, has come within a hair's-breadth of the truth, though missing it. <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

The first man, Quetzalcoalt, after having ruled as king of the Golden Age in Mexico, returned by divine direction to the primeval Paradise in the North (<i>Tlapallan</i>), and partook of the draught of immortality. The stupendous terraced pyramid-temple in Cholula was a copy and symbol of the sacred Paradise-mountain of Aztec tradition, which was described as standing "in the <i>Centre</i> of the <i>Middle-country</i>." <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">1</font></a> Some of the Mexican myths represent the mountain as now "crooked," or turned partly over.

 <p>Thus is all ancient thought full of this legendary idea of a mysterious, primeval, holy, Paradisaic Earth-centre,a spot connected as is no other with the "Centre of Heaven," the Paradise of God. Why it should be so no one has ever told us; but the hypothesis which places the Biblical Eden at the Pole, and makes all later earth navels commemorative of that primal one, affords a perfect explanation. In the light of it, there is no difficulty in understanding that Earth-centre in Jerusalem with which we began. The inconspicuous pillar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre symbolizes and commemorates far more than the geographical ignorance of mediæval ages. It stands for the Japanese pillar by which the first soul born upon earth mounted to the sky. It stands for the World-column of the East-Aryans and the Chinvat Bridge of Iran. It stands for the law-proclaiming pillar of orichalcum in Atlantis, placed in the centre of the most central land. It stands for that Talmudic pillar by means of which the tenants of the terrestrial Paradise mount to the celestial, and, having spent the Sabbath,</p>

It symbolizes Cardo, Atlas, Meru, Harâ-berezaiti, Kharsak-Kurra,every fabulous mountain on whose top the sky pivots itself, and around which all the heavenly bodies ceaselessly revolve. It perpetuates a religious symbolism which existed in its region before ever Jerusalem had been made the Hebrew capital,recalling to our modern world the <i>tabbur ha-aretz</i> of a period anterior to the days of Samuel. <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">1</font></a> In tradition it is said to mark the precise spot "whence the clay was taken, out of which the body of Adam was modeled." It does so, but it does it in a language and method which were common to all the most ancient nations of the earth.

 <p><a name="fn_328"></a><a href="pf28.htm#fr_328">226:1</a> As my own inspection of this monument was nearly thirty years ago, I have thought it well to make inquiry as to its present state. The following, written under date of Oct. 28, 1884, by my obliging friend, Dr. Selah Merrill, the United States Consul at Jerusalem, and well known as an Oriental archæologist, will be read with much interest: "The stone to which you refer still stands in the middle of the Church (Greek) of the Holy Sepulchre, and is called the Centre or Navel of the Earth. It is called a 'pillar,' although it is not a pillar, but a vase, conforming in its general shape to a large, tall fruit dish. The top is in the form of a basin, with a raised portion in its centre; that is, in the bottom of the basin. I was told that at every feast bread was laid on this pillar. I am assured that it is called the Centre of the Earth only by the Arab or native Christians of Syria, and not by the Greeks proper; also, that every Greek church in Syria that is built after the form of this one has such a 'pillar' in the centre. Within two or three years past, an old church has been <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a> excavated a little distance north of the Damascus gate. In the <i>Palestine Fund Report</i> for October, 1883, I wrote some account of this to supplement what had been written before by others. In the centre of that church there is a similar stone, but that is a real pillar. This church is no doubt very old, and is popularly spoken of as the 'Church of St. Stephen.' In my judgment it stands on the site of an older church.</p>  
 <p>"It seemed to me a little singular that this object should be called a 'pillar' (<i>Amûd</i>), when it is only a vase, or vase-shaped; but as the tradition connected with it is very old, the name may have come down from the time when the object used for this purpose was actually a pillar or column."</p>  
 <p>It is interesting to compare with the foregoing the description given by Bernard Surius, of Brussels, in the year 1646, particularly as at that time the "Oriental Greeks" seem to have had no scruple in calling the pillar the Centre of the Earth: "Omtrent het midden steckt eenen witten marmer-steen uyt, van twee voeten in syn vierkant, daer een rondt putteken in is, t welck soo de Oostsche Griecken seggen, het midden van den aerdt-bodem is." <i>Reyse van Jerusalem</i>. Antwerp, 1649: p. 664.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_329"></a><a href="pf28.htm#fr_329">227:1</a> Bishop Argulf, in his pilgrimage, A.D. 700, "saw some other relics, and he observed a lofty column in the holy places to the north of the Church of Golgotha, in the middle of the city, which at midday at the summer solstice casts no shadow; which shows that this is the centre of the earth." Wright, <i>Early Travels in Palestine</i>, p. 4. As late as A.D. 1102, it still seems to have been outside the then existing Church. Bishop Sæwulf says, "At the head of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, <i>in the wall outside</i>, not far from the place of Calvary, is the place called <i>Compas</i>, which our Lord Jesus Christ himself signified and measured with his own hand as the middle of the world according to the words of the Psalmist, 'God is my king of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.'" Ibid., p. 38. In 1322, however, it is described by Sir John de Maundeville as "in the midst of the Church." Ibid., p. 167. At one time in the Middle Ages, the spot seems to have been marked by a letter or inscription. <a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a> Barclay, <i>City of the Great King</i>.

They are called <i>Meru-sringas</i>, or the peaks of Meru. There are four of them either in or near Benares; the more modern, and of course the more perfect, is at a place called Sár-náth. It was raised in the year of Christ 1027. . . . This conical hill is about sixty feet high, with a small but handsome octagonal temple on the summit. It is said in the inscription that this artificial hill was intended as a representation of the worldly Meru, the hill of God, and the tower of Babel, with its seven steps or zones, was probably raised with a similar view and for the same purpose."Wilford in <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, vol. viii., p. 291.</p>

Their offspring, in turn, married; some among each other, others with the bears of the mountains [the Bear Tribe?]. The fruits of this latter union were men of extraordinary valor and nimble hunters, who, after a long life spent in the vicinity of their birth, departed to the far North, where they still live on the high and inaccessible tablelands above the mountains; and, being immortal, they direct, by their magical influences, the actions and the destiny of men; that is, the Ainos."Ibid., p. 28.</p>

Let no reader imagine this a meaningless rite of undeveloped savages." From all these observations, as well as from the traditions of the Ainos, in which are ever-recurring laments for a better past; and from many peculiarities in their customs, we must conclude that the Ainos are to be classed with those peoples that have earlier been more richly supplied with the implements of civilization, but have become degraded through isolation. Prehistoric discoveries . . . favor this view. The pits found there for dwellings indicate that the Ainos came from the North to Yezo." Professor Brauns, of Halle.

Il est assez remarquable quune telle idée nest pas sans fondement, puisquil faut admettre, comme je crois lavoir démontré, que lEurope, lAsie, et lAmérique, unis vers le pôle nord, formaient avant le déluge un seul continent." Frédérik Klee, <i>Le Déluge</i>, Fr. ed. Paris, 1847: p. 188 n. But, by clinging to "the highest mountains of Asia," as the centre originally meant, M. Klee loses the chief advantage of his supposed union of the continents at the Pole.The Teutonic <i>omphalos</i> of the world is preserved at Finzingen, near Altstädt, in Saxe-Weimar.

In like manner the national temple of Tlaloc and Vizilputzli, his brother, stood in the centre of the city of Mexico, whence four causeway roads conducted East, West, North, and South. In the centre of the temple was a richly ornamented Pillar of peculiar sanctity. Bancroft, <i>Native Races</i>, vol. iii., p. 292.
