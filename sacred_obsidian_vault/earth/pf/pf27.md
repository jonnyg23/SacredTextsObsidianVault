 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">To</span> the first men, on the hypothesis of an Arctic Eden, the zenith and the north pole of the heavens were identical. Such an aspect of the starry vault the humanity of our late historic ages has never seen. Under such an adjustment of the rotating firmament, how regular and orderly would nature appear! What profound significance would of necessity attach to that mysterious unmoving centre-point of cosmic revolution directly overhead! As intimated on page <a href="pf08.htm#page_50">50</a>, that polar centre must naturally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven, the changeless seat of the supreme God or gods. "And if, through all the long life-time of the antediluvian world, this circumpolar sky was thus to human thought the true abode of God, the</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>oldest postdiluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe half or two thirds the distance to the equator, could not easily forget that at the centre and true top of the firmament was the throne and the palace of its great Creator."</p>  
 <p>The religions of all ancient nations signally confirm and satisfy this antecedent expectation. With a marvelous unanimity <i>they associate the abode of the supreme God with the North Pole, "the centre of heaven," or with the celestial space immediately surrounding it</i>. No writer on Comparative Theology has ever brought out the facts which establish this assertion, but the following outline of them will suffice for our present purpose:</p>  
 <p>First. <i>The Hebrew Conception</i>.In so pure and lofty a monotheism as that of the ancient Hebrews, we must not expect to find any such strict localization of the supreme God in the circumpolar sky as we shall find among polytheistic peoples. "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" is the language of Jehovah. Nevertheless, as the Hebrews must be supposed to have shared, in some measure, the geographical and cosmological ideas of their age, it would not be strange if in their sacred writings traces of these ideas were here and there discernible. Some of these traces are quite curious, and they have attracted the attention of not a few Biblical scholars, to whom their origin and <i>rationale</i> are entirely unsuspected. Thus a learned writer on Hebrew geography, after blindly repeating the common assumption that "the Hebrews conceived the surface of the earth to be an immense disk, supported, like the flat roof of an Eastern house, by pillars," yet uses such language as this: "The North appears</p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>to have been regarded as the highest part of the earth's surface, in consequence, perhaps, of the mountain ranges which existed there." <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Another, touching upon the same subject, says, "The Hebrews regarded what lay to the North as <i>higher</i>, and what lay to the South as <i>lower:</i> hence they who traveled from South to North were said to 'go up,' while they who went from North to South were said to 'go down.'" <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Psalm seventy-fifth, verse sixth, we read, "Promotion cometh not from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South." Why this singular enumeration of three of the points of the compass, and this omission of the fourth? Simply because heaven, the proper abode of the supreme God, being conceived of by all the surrounding nations, if not by the Hebrews themselves, as in the North, in the circumpolar sky, that was the sacred quarter, and it could not reverently be said that promotion cometh not from the North. <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">3</font></a> It would have been as offensive as among us to say that promotion cometh not from above. Therefore, having completed his negative statements, the Psalmist immediately adds, "But God is the judge; He putteth down one, and setteth up another."</p>  
 <p>A curious trace of the same conception appears in the book of Job, in the eighth and ninth verses</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the twenty-third chapter. In Old Testament times, the Hebrews and the Arabians designated the cardinal points by the personal terms, "before" for East, "behind" for West, "left hand" for North, and "right hand" for South. Thus Job, in the passage indicated, is complaining that he can nowhere, East or West, North or South, find his divine judge. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a> But, in speaking of one of these points, he adds this singular qualification, "<i>where God doth work</i>." This is said of the left hand, or North. It seems to be inserted to render peculiarly emphatic the declaration, "I go . . . [even] to the left hand where He doth work, but I cannot behold Him." If at first blush such an apparent localizing of the divine agency seems inconsistent with Job's splendid descriptions of God's omnipresence in other passages, it should be remembered that we, too, speak of the omnipresent deity as dwelling "on high," and address Him as "Our Father which art <i>in Heaven</i>."</p>  
 <p>A natural counterpart to this idea of a northern heaven would be a belief or impression that spiritual perils and evils were in a peculiar degree or manner to be apprehended from the right hand, or South, as the proper abode of demons,the quarter to which Asmodeus fled when exorcised by the angel. <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a> We cannot positively affirm that such a belief consciously</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>prevailed among the ancient Hebrews, but, holding the possibility in mind, we find passages of Scripture which seem to stand out in a new and striking light. Thus, in case there was such a belief, how great the force and beauty of the expression, "Because [the Lord] is at my right hand [the side exposed to danger] I shall not be moved." <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">1</font></a> With this may be compared the confident expressions of the one hundred and twenty-first Psalm: "The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand." So also in the ninety-first it is on the right hand that destruction is anticipated: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and [or even] ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee." Again, in the one hundred and forty-second it is said, "I looked on my right hand, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul." Notice also the imprecation, "Let Satan stand at his right hand" (Ps. cix. 6), and the vision of Zechariah, where the great adversary makes his appearance on the right of the one whom he came to resist (Zech. iii. 1).</p>  
 <p>But as Satan here reveals himself from beneath and from the South, so to Ezekiel the true God reveals himself from above and from the North (Eze. i. 4). In that quarter was God's holy mountain (Is. xiv. 13), the city of the Great King (Ps. xlviii. 2), the land of gold (Job xxxvii. 22, marg.), the place where divine power had hung the earth upon nothing (Job xxvi. 7). <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">2</font></a> Hence the priest officiating at</p>

 <p>the altar, both in the tabernacle and later in the temple, faced the North. According to the Talmud, King David had an Æolian harp in the North window of his royal bed-chamber, by means of which the North wind woke him every night at midnight for prayer and pious meditations. <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">1</font></a> Probably it is not without significance that in Ezekiel's vision of the ideal temple of the future the chamber prepared for the priests in charge of the altar was one "whose prospect was toward the North." <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">2</font></a> (Eze. xl. 46.)</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Second. <i>The Egyptian Conception</i>.The correspondence of the ancient Egyptian conception of the world and of heaven with the foregoing would be remarkable did we not know that Egypt was the cradle of the Hebrew people. The ancient inhabitants of the Nile valley had the same idea as to the direction of the true summit of the earth. To them, as to the Hebrews, it was in the North. This was the more remarkable since it was exactly contrary to all the natural indications of their own country, which continually ascended toward the South. As stated in a previous chapter, Brugsch says, "The Egyptians conceived of the earth as rising toward the North, so that <i>in its northernmost point it at last joined the sky</i>." <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">1</font></a> In correspondence herewith the Egyptians located their Ta-nuter, or "land of the gods," in the extreme North. <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">2</font></a> On this account it is on the <i>northern</i> exterior wall of the great temple of Ammon at Karnac that the divinity promises to King Rameses II. the products of that heavenly country, "silver, gold, lapis-lazuli, and all the varieties of precious stones of the land of the gods." Hence, also, contrary to all natural indications, the northern hemisphere was considered the realm of light, the southern the realm of darkness. <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The passage out of the secret chambers of the Great Pyramid was pointed precisely at the North Pole of the heavens. All the other pyramids had their openings only on the northern side. That this arrangement had some religious significance few students of the subject have ever doubted. If our interpretation is correct, such passages from the burial chamber toward the polar heaven intimated a vital faith that from the chamber of death to the highest abode of life, imperishable and divine, the road is straight and ever open. <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Third. <i>The Conception of the Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Indians, and Iranians</i>.After what has been said in former chapters respecting the location of Kharsak Kurra, Sad Matâti, Har-Moed, Su-Meru, and Harâ-berezaiti, no further proof is needed that all the peoples above named associated the true heaven, the abode of the highest gods,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the northern celestial pole. <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a> In each case the apex of their respective mounts of the gods pierced the sky precisely at that point. To this day the Haranite Sabæansthe most direct heirs of the religious traditions of the Tigro-Euphratean worldconstruct their temples with careful reference to the ancient faith. <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a> Their priests also, in the act of sacrifice, like all ancient priesthoods, face the North. <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the Rig Veda, ii., 40, I, we read of the <i>amṛ́tasya nâ´bhim</i>, "the Navel of the Heavens." The same or similar expressions occur again and again in the Vedic literature. They refer to the northern celestial Pole, just as the expression <i>nâ´bhir pṛthivyâ´s</i>, "Navel of the Earth," R.V. iii., 29, 4, and elsewhere, signifies the northern terrestrial Pole. To each is ascribed preëminent sanctity. The one is the holiest</p>

 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>shrine in heaven, the other the holiest shrine on earth. That no translator has hitherto caught the true meaning of the terms seems unaccountable. <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Buddhism, the heir and conservator of so many of the ancient ideas of India, the same notion of a world ruler with his throne at the celestial Pole lived on. <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">2</font></a> Very curiously, if we follow the authority of the Lalitavistara, the first actions and words ascribed to the infant Buddha on his arrival in our world unmistakably identify the North with the abode of the gods, and <i>its nadir</i> with the abode of the demons. <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">3</font></a> Even the modern relics of the non-Aryan aboriginal tribes of India, as for example the Gonds, have retained this ancient ecumenical ethnic belief. <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Fourth. <i>The Phnician, Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Conception</i>.That the Phnicians shared the general Asiatic view of a mountain of the gods in the extreme North appears from Movers learned work upon that people. <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The evidence that in ancient Hellenic thought, also, the heaven of the gods was in the northern sky is incidental, but cumulative and satisfactory. For example, heaven is upheld by Atlas, but the terrestrial station of Atlas, as we have elsewhere shown, is at the North Pole. Again, Olympos was the abode of the gods; but if the now generally current etymology of this term is correct, Olympos was simply the Atlantean pillar, pictured as a lofty mountain, and supporting the sky at its northern Pole. <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">2</font></a> In fact, many writers now affirm that the Olympos of Greek mythology was originally simply the north polar "World-mountain" of the Asiatic nations. <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>In prayer the Greeks turned towards the North, and from Homer we know that when they addressed the "Olympian" gods they stretched out their hands "toward the starry heavens;" Greek prayers, therefore, must have been addressed toward the northern heavens. Entirely confirmatory of this is the account Plato gives of "the holy habitation of Zeus," in which the solemn convocations of the gods were held, and which, he explains, "was placed in the Centre of the World." <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>That this Centre is the northern celestial Pole is placed beyond question by a well-known passage from Servius Maurus, <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">2</font></a> where it is called the "<i>domicilium Jovis</i>," and where we are informed that the Etruscan and Roman augurs considered thunder and lightning in the northern sky more significant than in any other quarter, being "higher and <i>nearer to the abode of Jove</i>." <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">3</font></a> Countries in high northern latitudes shared in this peculiar sanctity.

 <p>the end of the official or state paganism," says M. Beauvois, "the Romans regarded Great Britain as nearer heaven and more sacred than the Mediterranean countries." <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">1</font></a> Varro and other Latin writers confirm this general representation, so that all modern expounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of Etruria in the Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a> Niebuhr and other authorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith. <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>Fifth. <i>The Japanese Conception</i>.We have already seen that in the Japanese cosmogony the down-thrust spear of Izanagi becomes the upright axis of heaven and earth. Izanagi's place, therefore, at the upper end of this axis can be nowhere else than at the North Pole of the sky. <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>But we are not left to inference. So inseparably was the Creator associated with the Pole in ancient Japanese thought that one of his loftiest and divinest titles was derived from this association. Writing of the primitive ideas of this people, one of our best authorities uses the following language: "I shall do the <i>Koji-ki</i>, and the Shinto religion, and the Japanese philosophy, strict justice by saying that, according to them, there existed in the beginning one god, and nobody and nothing besides.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"'Far in the deep infinitudes of space,<br>   Upon a throne of silence,'</small></div>  
 <p>sat the god Ame-no-mi-naka-nushi-no-kami, whose name signifies <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Lord of the Centre of Heaven</span>." <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>What this Centre of Heaven is cannot well be doubtful to any careful reader of the present chapter.</p>  
 <p>Sixth. <i>The Chinese Conception</i>.The oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of Shang-te, the highest of all gods. It is believed to have existed more than two thousand years before Christ. Shang-te is usually and correctly described</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>as the god of heaven. But his proper place of abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we inquire as to the meaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books inform us that it is "a celestial space about the North Pole." <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Here, as in Japan, and in Egypt, and in India, and in Iran, and in Greece, the Pole is "the centre" of the sky. A writer in the "Chinese Repository" quotes from authoritative religious books these declarations: "The Polar star is the Centre of Heaven." "Shang-te's throne is in Tsze-wei, <i>i.e.</i>, the Polar star." "Immediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar star, which is Shang-te's heavenly abode." "In the central place the Polar star of Heaven, the one Bright One, the Great Monad, always dwells." <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>In accordance with this conception, the Emperor and his assistants, when officiating before the Altar of Heaven, always face the North. <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">3</font></a> The Pole-star itself is a prominent object of worship. <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">4</font></a> And how prevalent this localization of the abode of God at</p>

 <p>the Pole remains after four thousand years may be illustrated by the following incident narrated by Rev. Dr. Edkins: "I met on one occasion a schoolmaster from the neighborhood of Chapoo. He asked if I had any books to give away on astronomy and geography. Such books are eagerly desired by all members of the literary class. . . . The inquiry was put to him 'Who is the Lord of heaven and earth?' He replied that he knew none but the Polestar, called in the Chinese language <i>Teen-hwang-ta-te</i>,the Great Imperial Ruler of Heaven." <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Seventh. <i>The Ancient German and the Finnic Conception</i>.Like the ancients, when praying and sacrificing to the gods, the pagan Germans turned their faces toward the North. <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">2</font></a> There, in the northern heaven, at the top of Yggdrasil, the world-axis, stood the fair city of Asgard, the home of the Asen. The Eddas expressly say of it that it was built "in the Centre of the World." <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">3</font></a> At that point, whence alone</p>

 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>the whole world of men is ever visible by night and by day, stood Hlidskjálf, the watch-tower of Odin. From this "<i>partie septentrionale du ciel</i>" he and Frigga, like the great gods of the Etruscans, "<i>veillaient sur toute la terre</i>." <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Among the ancient Finns the name of the supreme god was Ukko. In their mythology he is sometimes represented as upbearing the firmament, like Atlas, and sometimes he is called <i>Taivahan Napanen</i>, "the Navel of Heaven." As Castrén shows, this curious title is given him simply because he resides in the centre or Pole of heaven. <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">2</font></a> In the great epic of this people, the Kalevala, the abode of the supreme God is called Tähtela, <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">3</font></a> which word simply means "Place of <i>Tähti:</i> Esthonian, <i>Täht</i>, the Polar star."</p>  
 <p>We have not exhausted our materials in hand for the illustration of this point, <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">4</font></a> but surely we have presented enough. Reviewing this singular unanimity of the ancient nations, no thoughtful reader can fail to be impressed with its significance. No other explanation of it can be so simple and obvious as the supposition that the heaven which overarched the cradle of humanity was a heaven whose zenith was the northern Pole.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________________</p>  
 <p>Before concluding the present chapter, another point of considerable interest should be noticed. In reading the Edenic traditions of the ancient nations</p>

 <p>as given in Part fourth, the question may well have suggested itself to the reader, "How is it that, with such perfect unanimity on the part of contemporary nations in respect to the north-polar position of the cradle of mankind, the traditions of the Hebrews alone should have placed it in the East?" In the facts just now reviewed we have a key to this puzzle. The only word in Genesis which connects Eden with the East is Kedem (<i>Qedem</i>). This term "properly means that which is <i>before</i> or <i>in front of</i> a person, and was applied to the East from <i>the custom</i> of turning in that direction when describing the points of the compass." <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">1</font></a> From Gen. xiii. 14, it would seem to have acquired this association with the East as early as the days of Abraham, but according to "the custom" of a particular time or people it could mean one point of the compass as well as another. It was simply the "front-country." In late historic times among the Hebrews it was the East, and accordingly the West was the country "behind," the North the "left hand," the South the "right," as before noticed. In Egypt, however, the usage was different,the "front-country" being either the North or the South,which we cannot certainly tell, as Egyptologists are divided on the question. Pierret thinks that it was South, and that accordingly the right hand was West and the left East. <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">2</font></a> Chabas and others, however, exactly reverse the meaning of the hieroglyphics translated "right" and "left," and hold that in designating the points of the compass the ancient Egyptian faced the North.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Among the Akkadians and Assyrians, if we may rely upon a questionable statement of Lenormant, still another adjustment prevailed: the right hand was the North, the left the South, and the "front" direction, of course, the West. <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>In view of these facts it is plain that, anterior to the fixation of Hebrew usage, that is in pre-Abrahamic times, <i>Qedem</i>, or the "front-country," may as well have meant the North as any other quarter. And there is much reason to suppose that it did have this meaning. We have seen that this was peculiarly the sacred quarter of the whole Asiatic and Egyptian world. Toward it faced all earliest priest-hoods and worshipers of whom we have any knowledge. <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">2</font></a> What so natural as that they should contemplate and designate the different quarters of the world from the standpoint of their normal posture in worship? And if once we assume that such was the usage of all the Noachidæ anterior to their dispersion, and that accordingly "the front-country" meant the North, all at once becomes plain. Genesis then unites with universal ethnic tradition in locating the cradle of mankind in the North. The record then reads, "And the Lord God planted a garden in the North country, in Eden." And, in precise agreement herewith, it is down from the mountainous heights of this North country"from</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Qedem "that the descendants of Noah in after time come into "the plain in the land of Shinar" (Gen. xi. 2). So is cleared up simultaneously another mystery, for how to bring the first colonizers of Shinar into the Tigro-Euphrates valley, from any probable Ararat by any probable "journeying <i>from the East</i>," or, as the margin gives it, "<i>eastwards</i>," has always perplexed the commentator. <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>This interpretation harmonizes for the first time Gen. ii. 8 with Eze. xxviii. 13, both now referring to one and the same point of the compass, the sacred North. Again, the well-known difficulty of harmonizing the references to "the children of Qedem," found in the oldest of the Hebrew Scriptures, such as Gen. xxix. t, and Job i. 3, is solved at once by this interpretation. At the same time it gives us a location for "the land of Uz" exactly corresponding with the explicit declaration of Josephus: "Uz founded Trachonitis and Damascus; this country lies between Palestine and Closyria." <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>To most readers, this solution of the problem of the exceptional character of the Hebrew tradition will probably at once commend itself as eminently satisfactory. To some, however, it may seem a little difficult of belief that one and the same term could in successive ages have found application to different points of the compass. <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">3</font></a> To such the following,</p>

 <p>written, of course, with no reference to our problem, will be of special interest: "The names of the four cardinal points, and, what is very remarkable, the hieroglyphic signs by which they are expressed, are in a certain measure the same in the Akkadian and Chinese cultures. This I intend to show in a special monograph upon the subject; but that which is here of importance to note is the displacement of the geographical horizon produced in the establishing of the 'hundred families.' The South, which was so termed on the cuneiform tablets, corresponds in Chinese to the East, the North to the West, the East to the South, making thus a displacement of quarter of a circle. It would be interesting if, on examination of the Akkadian and Assyrian names, we could find that they in their turn denoted an early displacement of which only these traces remain to us." <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>Possibly the usage of ancient Egypt may enable us to put our solution in yet simpler form. If we may accept the teachings of the learned Maspéro, the Egyptians often reduced the four quarters or directions to two, using the term East in a sense sufficiently broad to include both East and North, and the term West in a sense sufficiently broad to include both West and South. <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">1</font></a> If, then, Moses, who in his education was an Egyptian, wrote in accordance</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>with such a usage, it would be quite possible to use Qedem for a "front-country" in the North, and again, without embarrassment, to use the same term in speaking of the East. <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="pf27.htm#fr_283">207:2</a> At first view it seems strange that in the Middle Ages, in Christian Europe, the North should have come to be regarded as the special abode of Satan and his subjects, and that on the north side of some churches, near the baptismal font, there should have been a "Devil's Door," which was opened to let the evil spirit pass to his own place at the time of the renunciation of him by the person baptized. The simple explanation of this is found in the fact that the people were taught that their old gods, whom they had worshiped when pagans, were devils. Compare Grimm, <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i>, p. 30, 31. Conway, in his <i>Demonology and Devil Lore</i> (London, 1879: vol. ii., 115; i., 87), entirely misconceives the philosophy of the fact. A similar change seems to have occurred among the Iranians after Mazdeism <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a> had transformed their ancient Daêvas from gods to demons. Hence, while in portions of the Avestan literature (generally the older) the heaven of Ahura Mazda is in the North, in other portions the North is the world of death and demons.

But the apparent difficulty is transformed into an all the stronger proof of the correctness of our theory when it is remembered that in the most ancient times Set "was not a god of evil," but the supreme world-sovereign from whom the Egyptian kings derived their authority over the two hemispheres. "<i>It was not till the decline of the Empire</i> <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a> that this deity came to be regarded as an evil demon, that his name was effaced from the monuments, and other names substituted for his in the Ritual."

Massey, in his vast astrotypological medley, refers to the horizon-displacement, but affords no intelligible explanation. He says, "In making the change to a circle of twelve signs, the point of commencement in the North was 'slewed' round eastward. Hence the Akkadian Mountain of the World became the Mountain of the East. Mount Meru, the primordial birthplace in the North, likewise became the Mountain eastward. This may be followed in the Adamah of the Genesis; and in the Book of Enoch it says, 'The fourth wind, which is named the North, is divided into three parts, and the third part contains Paradise.' Thus Eden, which began at the summit of the Mount, and descended into the Circle of Four Quarters prepared by Yima, in the Avesta, against the coming Deluge, was finally planted in the twelfth division of the zodiac of twelve signs, as the garden eastward." <i>The Natural Genesis</i>.

 <p><a name="fn_325"></a><a href="pf27.htm#fr_325">223:1</a> "Jai exposé depuis longtemps dans mes cours au Collége de France une théorie daprès laquelle les Egyptiens auraient divisé les quatre points en deux séries groupées: Nord-Est, Sud-Ouest. . . . Ce nest que par suite de la classification dont je viens de parler quon met souvent à lOuest les régions proprement situées au Sud, ou reciproquement au Sud les régions situées à lOuest. Lapplication de cette idée à lEst nous mène aussi à croire que lon a pu dire du <i>Tanoutri</i> quil était au Nord." (M. Maspéro, in a letter to the author, under date of December 20, 1882.) This usage could hardly have arisen among any people not acquainted with the spherical figure of the earth. How easily it could arise among us is illustrated by Sir John de Maundeville, who, writing in A.D. 1356, located Paradise so far to the East of England that <i>he could no longer correctly describe the place by this term</i>. Thus, after speaking of the Terrestrial Paradise as situate far "to the East, at the <i>beginning</i> of the earth," he says, "But this is not that East which we call our East, on this half, where the sun rises to us; for when the sun is East in those parts towards Terrestrial Paradise, it is then midnight in our parts on this half, on account of the roundness of the earth, of which I have told you before; for our Lord God made the earth all round in the middle of the firmament." Wright, <i>Early Travels in Palestine</i>. London, 1848: p. 276. The nearest way to an Eden thus located would, of course, be northward. Its location could therefore be described with equal correctness either by the term "eastward" or "northward." Still another interesting theory of its origin will suggest itself to the thoughtful student of such facts as those alluded to by Mr. Scribner in <i>Where Did Life Begin?</i> pp. 32, 33.</p>
