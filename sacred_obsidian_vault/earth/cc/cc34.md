 <p>Deals with the laws and processes of attainment of immortality in the flesh through the office and function of the Messiah. There can be no attainment of immortality without the God-appointed Messiah, the Messenger of the Covenant. The Messiah is the advance fruit, and it is through the raising up of this fruit, and its final absorption into the mental consciousness of the invisible Deities, that the eternal cycle is perpetuated, and the Sons of God are manifest. Perfect obedience to the laws which the Messiah enunciates is absolutely essential for the attainment of physical immortality. Therefore, the perusal of this work is that of the student who thinks and reasons along the line of Universology, as set forth by the Author (KORESH), and not according to preconceived notions. The climax of arch-natural being is physical immortality, and its goal eternal life.</p>
