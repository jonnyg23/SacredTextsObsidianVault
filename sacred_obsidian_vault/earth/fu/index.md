 One of the perennial pre-Columbian contact theories involves ancient visits by
 the Chinese to America.
 This is made plausible for several reasons.
 First of all, the voyage around the great circle route across the Pacific
 is facilitated by almost constant visibility of land
 and prevailing sea-currents.
 China had advanced maritime technology long before the European age of
 discovery, and historically were known to have taken long sea voyages
 to distant ports such as Africa, Arabia and India before Vasco de Gamma
 set sail.
 And lastly, there are suggestive Chinese accounts of lands far to the
 East in their chronicles.
 This book, written in the 19th century by Charles Leland, examines
 these records, and also reviews some of the evidence for such contacts.
 </p>
 <p>
 This has remained a popular hypothesis to the current day.
 For instance,
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006054094X/internetsacredte"><cite>1421 :The Year China Discovered America</cite></a>, by Gavin Menzies, and
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585423203/internetsacredte"><cite>Voyages of the Pyramid Builders</cite></a>, by Jeremy P. Tarcher,
 are two
 recent books which propose pre-Columbian voyages from China to the New World.
 However, Leland's <cite>Fusang</cite> explored this
 concept over a century ago, and is required reading if you have any interest
 in this topic.
