 <p><cite>Christian Topography</cite>, written in the 6th century C.E.,
 is a classic flat earth text.
 Cosmas believed that the Earth was rectangular and that the sky
 was shaped like a horizontal half-cylinder resting on a box.
 It looks a bit like an old pirate chest.
 Cosmas believed that it the Tabernacle constructed by Moses was
 based on the form of the universe.
 There is a huge mountain that the sun goes behind when it is night.
 Cosmas uses scriptural arguments to justify his flat-earth cosmology.
 The text also contains geographical information that
 Cosmas collected during his far-ranging travels,
 which took him all the way to India.

 This etext is derived from the version at the
 <a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm">Additional Early Church Fathers at the Tertullian Project website</a>, which I highly recommend.
 I have converted all of the Greek text (which was encoded 
 in a special Greek font) to Unicode.
