 EXPLANATION  OF  THE   PLATES.
 </h1>
 <p>
 Plate I.----The picture on the left represents the City of Adulê----that on the right an Ethiopian travelling from Adulê to Axômê. The lower picture on the left is the tablet with the Greek inscription copied by Cosmas. It is surmounted by the figure of Ptolemy Euergetês, standing in a warlike attitude. The throne represented on the right is ascribed to the same Ptolemy by Cosmas, but erroneously. It was placed at Adulê by an Axumite conqueror. The writing on the right of it is<i></i> Δίφρος Πτολεμοικός, Ptolemy's chair.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 2.----The figure of the earth and the heaven, as Cosmas and the ancient Fathers conceived it. The cross-bar represents the firmament.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 3.----A picture of the waters above the firmament.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 4.----A representation of the conical mountain, and also of the sun and the moon under the firmament. The inscription along the pillars is: of<i></i> οἱ στύλοι του̃ οὐρανου̃, the pillars of the heaven.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 5.----A tracing of the inhabited world (γη̃ οἰκουμένη).
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 6.----A representation of the oblong rectangular figure of the earth which we inhabit, with its surrounding ocean, which is itself surrounded by the other earth which was the seat of Paradise and the abode of man before the Flood. The four gulfs which penetrate into our earth from the ocean, and the rivers which flow into it from Paradise, are also depicted. Above the ocean in the outer earth is this inscription· Φη̃ πέραν του̃ ὠκεανου̃ ἔνθα πρὸ του̃ κατακλυσμου̃ κατώκουν οἱ ἄνθρωποι ,<i> </i>the earth beyond the ocean where men dwelt before the Flood. The lateral inscription is· Φη̃ πέραν του̃ ὠκεανου̃, the earth beyond the ocean. The inscription in the figure of the great gulf coming from the west is<i></i> Ρωμαικὸς Κόλπος, the Roman gulf, <i>ie</i>., the Mediterranean. The gulf coming from the north Cosmas calls<i></i> Κασπετά Θάλασσα, the Caspian Sea. The name of the northern river is Φεισω̃ν, and of the southern Φηω̃ν ποταμός, the Pison and Gihon of our bibles.

 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 7.----A representation of the earth with the walls which come down to it from heaven. The four gulfs are shown, and the conical mountain in the north-west whence the earth slopes downward to the south.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 8.----A picture of the conical mountain with three circling lines to show the paths of the sun as he moves round it at different altitudes, thus making the nights shorter or longer. The words written here are μικρὰ νὺξ, μέση νὺξ, μεγάλη νὺξ, short night, night of medium length, long night.
 </p>
 <p>
 Plate 9.----The figure of the world according to the Ptolemaic system. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are shown, and the names are given of the Roman and Egyptian months. The earth, in the form which Cosmas so much abhorred, is in the centre, encircled by the orbits in succession of the Moon, Σελήνης? of Mercury, Ἑρμου̃? of Venus<i></i>, ̕Αφροδίτης? of the Sun, Ἡλίου? of Mars, Ἄρεος? of Jupiter, Δίος. The names of the Roman months are given in Greek characters, thus<i></i>· Γεναρις, Φλεβάρις, Μάρτιος, Αυρίλλιος<i> </i>(u = v<i></i>̓, Μαιος, Ιουνιος, Ιουλιος, ̕Αυγυστος, Σεπτεβριος, υκτωβριος, Νοευριος, Δικεβρις. Above the outer rim of the Zodiac are given the names of the twelve signs with the names of the corresponding Egyptian months<i></i>· Αιγό-κερως Tybi<i></i>? τοξότης Choiac<i></i>? σκορπίος Athyr<i></i>· ζυγὸς Phaophy<i></i>? παρθένος Thôth? λέων Mesori<i></i>? καρκίνος Epiphi?

 Plate 21. ---- A front and back view of Aaron wearing his priestly robes<i></i> τὸ σχη̃μα του̃ ἱερέως. Montfaucon states that Cosmas, in explanation of this sketch, wrote for the figure on the right<i></i>· ̕Ααρὼν μέγας ἀρχιερεὺς ἐμπροσθοφανής front view of Aaron, the great high priest; and for the figure on the left<i></i>· ̕Ααρὼν μέγας ἀρχιερευ̃ς ὀπισθοφανής back view of Aaron, the great high priest.

Montfaucon takes the latter
 <a name="p392">|392</a>
 word to be a mistake for<i></i> συκόμορος the fig-mulberry, called also συκάμινος ἡ ̕Αιγυπτία? in Mesori (August̓, συ̃κα σταφύλια, figs, grapes: but to judge from the picture only one kind of fruit is indicated; in Thôth (September<i></i>̓, ελαιόδακνα an unknown fruit; in Phaophy (October<i></i>̓, φοίνικες, palms or palm-leaves; in Athyr (November<i></i>̓, ἀσπαράγια asparagus; in Choiac (December̓, μαλάχαι mallows; in Tybi (January̓, ἐυτύβια, endives; in Mechir (February̓, ἀγλάτια· this is unknown; in Phamenôth (March<i></i>̓, κίτρα fruit of citron?
