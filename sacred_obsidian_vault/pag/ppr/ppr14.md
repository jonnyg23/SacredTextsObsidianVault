   <h3 align="center">PRAYER OF TRANSFORMATION INTO A LOTUS</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Egyptian</i>)</p>  
 <p>HAIL, thou lotus! Thou type of the god Nefer-Temu!</p>  
 <p>I am the man that knoweth you, and I know your names among those of the gods, the lords of the under-world, and I am one of you.</p>  
 <p>Grant ye that I may see the gods who are the divine guides in the underworld, and grant ye unto me a place in the underworld near unto the lords of Amentet.</p>  
 <p>Let me arrive at a habitation in the land of Tchesert, and receive me, O all ye gods, in the presence of the lords of eternity!</p>  
 <p>Grant that my soul may come forth whithersoever it pleaseth, and let it not be driven away from the presence of the great company of the gods!</p>
