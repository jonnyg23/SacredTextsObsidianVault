   <h3 align="center">THE SALUTATION OF THE DAWN</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Hindu</i>)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>LISTEN to the exhortation of the Dawn!<br> Look to this Day! For it is Life, The very Life of Life.<br> In its brief course lie all the Varieties And Realities of your Existence;<br>   The Bliss of Growth,<br>   The Glory of Action,<br>   The Splendor of Beauty;<br> For Yesterday is but a Dream,<br> And To-morrow is only a Vision;<br> But To-day well lived<br> Makes every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,<br> And every To-morrow a Vision of Hope.<br> Look well therefore to this Day!<br> Such is the Salutation of the Dawn.</dir>
