   <h3 align="center">PRAYER TO KAMI-DANA</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Japanese</i>)</p>  
 <p>REVERENTLY adoring the great god of the two palaces of Ise, .............................. and the gods of the branch temples and branch palaces, and Sohodo no kami, whom I have invited to the shrine set upon this divine altar, and to whom I offer praises day by day.</p>  
 <p>I pray with awe that they will deign to correct the unwitting faults, which, heard and seen by them, I have committed, and blessing and favoring me according to the powers which they severally wield, cause me to follow the divine example and to perform good works in the Way.</p>
