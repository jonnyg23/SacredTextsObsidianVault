   <h3 align="center">HYMN TO THE ALL-MOTHER</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Mexican</i>)</p>  
 <p><font size="-1">(This goddess is Teteo-inan, the "Mother of Gods"--also known by another name meaning "Heart of the Earth." Her chief temple was on the spot selected by the early missionaries for the "Lady of Guadaloupe" to make her appearance, and the native shrine was razed to make way for the temple of the imported cult of Christendom)</font></p>  
 <p></p><dir>HAIL to our Mother who makes the yellow flowers to bloom--who scatters the seeds of the maguey as she comes from the Land Divine!<br> Hail to our Mother who casts forth white flowers in abundance!<br> Hail to our Mother who shines in the thorn bush as a bright butter-fly!<br> Ho! She is our Mother--the woman god of the earth. In the desert she feeds the wild beasts, and gives them to live.<br> Thus--thus you see her ever abundant in gifts to all flesh.<br> And as you see the goddess of earth give to the beasts, so also she is giving to the green herbs and the fishes.<br> Hail to our Mother who casts forth yellow flowers to the sun from the Land Divine!</dir>
