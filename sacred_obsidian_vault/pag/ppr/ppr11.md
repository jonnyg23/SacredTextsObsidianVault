   <h3 align="center">MAGICAL INCANTATION</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Chaldean</i>)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>I HAVE invoked thee, O Sun, in the midst of the high heavens.<br> Thou art in the shadow of the cedar, and thy feet rest on the summits.<br> The countries have called thee eagerly, they have directed their looks towards thee,<br> O Friend, thy brilliant light illuminates every land, overthrowing all that impedes thee, assemble the countries, for thou, O Sun, knowest their boundaries.<br> Thou who annihilatest falsehood, who dissipated the evil influence of wonders, omens, sorceries, dreams, evil apparitions, who turnest to a happy issue malicious designs, who annihilatest men and countries that devote themselves to fatal sorceries, I have taken refuge in thy presence.<br> Do not allow those who make spells, and are hardened, to arise.<br> Frighten their heart,<br> Settle also, O Sun, light of the great gods<br> Right into my marrow, O Lords of breath, that I may rejoice, even I.<br> May the gods who created me take my hands!<br> Direct the breath of my mouth!<br> My hands direct them also, Lord, light of the legions of the heavens. Sun, O Judge!</dir>
