 <h3 align="CENTER">GERMAN DRUIDISM.</h3>
 <p>Louis de Baecker, 1854, gave an account of Teutonic Druidism, similar to that of the Belgæ of Britain, in his <i>De la Religion du Nord de la France avant le Christianisme</i>. He, unlike men of the Welsh Druidic school, joins Dr. Ledwich, and some Irish authorities, in tracing Druidism to the German and Scandinavian races; saying, "The religion of our pagan ancestors was that of Odin or Woden." But he evidently refers to north-eastern France rather than north-western, as he derives the religion from the Edda. In the book <i>Volu-Spa</i>, or the Priestess, the first song of the poetic Edda, he discovers what Ossian and other British and Irish bards describe as Spirits of the air, of earth, of waters, of plains, and woods. "Cæsar was deceived," says he, "when he said that the Germans had neither priests nor religious ceremonies; for Tacitus mentions them in his <i>Germania</i> in the most formal manner." By the way, if Cæsar was so mistaken about the Germans, whom he knew so well, is his evidence about Gaulish Druids worth much?</p>
 <p>Baecker's northern Gauls had priests of various kinds. The sacrificers were called <i>Blodmanner</i>, or <i>Pluostari</i>; the sustainers of order were <i>Ewart</i> and <i>Gotes-ewart</i>; the protectors of sacred woods, <i>Harugari</i>, <i>Parawari</i>, or <i>Wihesmart</i>; the prophets, <i>Spamadhr, Wizago, Vitega, Veitsga, Weissager, Wetekey</i>. The Priestesses were the <i>Vaulur</i>. The horse, bull, boar, and sheep were sacrificed. "It was in the middle of the wood," he writes, "that the Belgæ offered their sacrifices." The Belgic Britons, doubtless, had a similar Druidism.</p>
 <p>Cæsar asserts that the Germans had no Druids, while be credits the German Belgæ of South Britain with having them.</p>
