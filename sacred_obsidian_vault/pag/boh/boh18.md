 <h3 align="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN</h3>
 <p>Bring forth the raisins and the nuts--<br>
 To-night All Hallows' Spectre struts<br>
 Along the moonlit way.<br>
 No time is this for tear or sob,<br>
 Or other woes our joys to rob,<br>
 But time for Pippin and for Bob,<br>
 And Jack-o'-lantern gay.</p>
 <p>Come forth, ye lass and trousered kid,<br>
 From prisoned mischief raise the lid,<br>
 And lift it good and high.<br>
 Leave grave old Wisdom in the lurch,<br>
 Set Folly on a lofty perch,<br>
 Nor fear the awesome rod of birch<br>
 When dawn illumes the sky.</p>
 <p>'Tis night for revel, set apart<br>
 To reillume the darkened heart,<br>
 And rout the hosts of Dole.<br>
 'Tis night when Goblin, Elf, and Fay,<br>
 Come dancing in their best array<br>
 To prank and royster on the way,<br>
 And ease the troubled soul.</p>
 <p>The ghosts of all things, past parade,<br>
 Emerging from the mist and shade<br>
 That hid them from our gaze,<br>
 And full of song and ringing mirth,<br>
 In one glad moment of rebirth,<br>
 Again they walk the ways of earth,<br>
 As in the ancient days.</p>
 <p>The beason light shines on the hill,<br>
 The will-o'-wisps the forests fill<br>
 With flashes filched from noon;<br>
 And witches on thier broomsticks spry<br>
 Speed here and yonder in the sky,<br>
 And lift their strident voices high<br>
 Unto the Hunter's moon.</p>
 <p>The air resounds with tuneful notes<br>
 From myriads of straining throats,<br>
 All hailing Folly Queen;<br>
 So join the swelling choral throng,<br>
 Forget your sorrow and your wrong,<br>
 In one glad hour of joyous song<br>
 To honor Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>--J.K. BANGS in Harper's Weekly, Nov. 5, 1910.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN FAILURE</h3>
 <p>Who's dat peekin' in de do'?<br>
 Set mah heart a-beatin'!<br>
 Thought I see' a spook for sho<br>
 On mah way to meetin'.<br>
 Heerd a rustlin' all aroun',<br>
 Trees all sort o' jiggled;<br>
 An' along de frosty groun'<br>
 Funny shadders wriggled.</p>
 <p>Who's dat by de winder-sill?<br>
 Gittin' sort o' skeery;<br>
 Feets is feelin' kind o' chill,<br>
 Eyes is sort o' teary.<br>
 'Most as nervous as a coon<br>
 When de dawgs is barkin',<br>
 Er a widder when some spoon<br>
 Comes along a-sparkin'.</p>
 <p>Whass dat creepin' up de road,<br>
 Quiet like a ferret,<br>
 Hoppin' sof'ly as a toad?<br>
 Maybe hit's a sperrit!<br>
 Lordy! hope dey ain't no ghos'<br>
 Come to tell me howdy.<br>
 I ain't got no use for those<br>
 Fantoms damp an' cloudy.</p>
 <p>Whass dat standin' by de fence<br>
 Wid its eyes a-yearnin',<br>
 Drivin' out mah common-sense<br>
 Wid its glances burnin'?<br>
 Don't dass skeercely go to bed<br>
 Wid dem spookses roun' me.<br>
 Ain't no res' fo' dis yere head<br>
 When dem folks surroun' me.</p>
 <p>Whass dat groanin' soun' I hear<br>
 Off dar by de gyardin?<br>
 Lordy! Lordy! Lordy dear,<br>
 Grant dis sinner pardon!<br>
 I won't nebber--I declar'<br>
 Ef it ain't my Sammy!<br>
 Sambo, what yo' doin' dar?<br>
 Yo' can't skeer yo' mammy!</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN</h3>
 <p>Pixie, kobold, elf, and sprite<br>
 All are on their rounds to-night,--<br>
 In the wan moon's silver ray<br>
 Thrives their helter-skelter play.</p>
 <p>Fond of cellar, barn, or stack<br>
 True unto the almanac,<br>
 They present to credulous eyes<br>
 Strange hobgoblin mysteries.</p>
 <p>Cabbage-stumps--straws wet with dew--<br>
 Apple-skins, and chestnuts too,<br>
 And a mirror for some lass<br>
 Show what wonders come to pass.</p>
 <p>Doors they move, and gates they hide<br>
 Mischiefs that on moonbeams ride<br>
 Are their deeds,--and, by their spells,<br>
 Love records its oracles.</p>
 <p>Don't we all, of long ago<br>
 By the ruddy fireplace glow,<br>
 In the kitchen and the hall,<br>
 Those queer, coof-like pranks recall?</p>
 <p>Eery shadows were they then--<br>
 But to-night they come again;<br>
 Were we once more but sixteen<br>
 Precious would be Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>--JOEL BENTON in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 31, 1896.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN</h3>
 <p>A gypsy flame in on the hearth,<br>
 Sign of this carnival of mirth.<br>
 Through the dun fields and from the glade<br>
 Flash merry folk in masquerade--<br>
 It is the witching Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>Pale tapers glimmer in the sky,<br>
 The dead and dying leaves go by;<br>
 Dimly across the faded green<br>
 Strange shadows, stranger shades, are seen,--<br>
 It is the mystic Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>Soft gusts of love and memory<br>
 Beat at the heart reproachfully;<br>
 The lights that burn for those who die<br>
 Were flickering low, let them flare high--<br>
 It is the haunting Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>--A.F. MURRAY in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 30, 1909.</p>
