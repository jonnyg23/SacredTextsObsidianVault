 <h3 align="CENTER">NOTE</h3>
 <p>THE ORIGINAL of this text is in the Bodleian Library (Douce. I. 230, which, however, lacks pp. 9 and 10; these have been taken from 'Wood B21'). The text (<i>not the Preface</i>) is reprinted line for line and page for page; pages are numbered as in the original. The few corrections which I have made are noted on p. 82.</p>
