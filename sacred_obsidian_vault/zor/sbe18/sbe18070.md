 <p>1. The sixty-second question is that which you ask thus: Would they authorisedly carry off any property whatever from foreigners and infidels, or not?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that wealth and property and anything that foreigners (an-aîrânŏ) possess and is carried off by them from the good with violence, <i>and which through</i> obstinacy they do not give back</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>when it is proper, it is well allowable in <i>that</i> case that they should seize from the foreigners. 3. So long as <i>it</i> is the lawful order of the procurator of its owners <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>it</i> is allowable for a just decider to consider properly, and to demand authoritatively the sending of interest (sû<i>d</i>ŏ) thereon for himself. 4. But <i>if</i> they proceed in their obstinacy <i>he</i> is sent to come <i>up</i> with them in obstinacy, not to dissemble with them <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>It is</i> the custom to give an infidel (ak-dînô), who is not a foreigner, food, clothing, <i>and</i> medicine, when his renunciation (vâ<i>z</i>) has come, for keeping away matters (<i>k</i>isânŏ) of death and sickness owing to hunger <i>and</i> thirst, cold and heat; but wealth, horses, accoutrements, wine, <i>and</i> land are not given authorisedly, it is said, unto foreigners <i>and</i> idolators <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
