 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eighty-fourth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>As to</i> a gift for the ceremonial <i>which</i> they do not reduce, and while they give <i>it</i> in excess, in what manner is then its great advantage, <i>and</i> how <i>and</i> in how many modes is it possible to occur?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the advancement of the ceremonial of the sacred beings is by so much as the gift is more fully given; and the great advantage of the good work is more, and its reasons many, therefrom. 3. The desire of this wealth, which <i>has</i> come for the sake of the good work, is an experience</p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the comfortable living of the angels, by whom the solemnizers are aggrandized, and is proper apart from <i>its</i> great judiciousness; to diminish <i>it</i> is improper.</p>  
 <p>4. When the gift <i>for</i> the ceremonial is abundantly given, the performers of the ceremonial, who, with much trouble annoying them, <i>have</i> solemnized the Avesta <i>and</i> chanted the hymns (Gâthas), and obtain the stipend of their solemnizing from the remuneration <i>of</i> the solemnization, are living comfortably, thriving, and blessed. 5. And also the undertakers of all the religious rites who, by means of the hope of rightful religion, render <i>one</i> certain as to the way <i>to</i> the distant awful place <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and tempt the longers for righteousness into the religion <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">2</font></a>, undertake all the religious rites <i>and</i> ceremonial <i>of</i> the sacred beings for the sake of the stipend of proper diligence.</p>  
 <p>6. And reasoning thought is cognizant as regards the advantageousness due to the undertakers and solemnizers of all the religious rites, and a great stipend is more obtained and observed <i>for them</i> than for <i>any</i> other profession. 7. The sons, too, of priests and disciples strive for the words prayed <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and are more eager for their. prayers; and many, likewise, shall engage for all the religious rites, and become more diffusive of the religion (dînô bâli<i>s</i>nîktar); and, in like, manner, the proper, more attainable, <i>and</i> more propitious path of the good for saving the soul becomes wider <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>
