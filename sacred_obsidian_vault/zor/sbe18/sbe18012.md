 <p>1. The third question is that you ask thus: For what reason does this greatness <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a> of a righteous man exist?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>it</i> is for the performance of what is desirable for the creator by the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper; because he strives unhesitatingly that the way for the performance of what is desirable for the creator <i>may</i> be the propitiation <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> which is his, desire, and that desired propitiation <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> becomes perfect through sound wisdom. 3. The wisdom by which he understands about the desire of the heavenly angels is not appointed (vakht), but is the true, pure religion which is knowledge of <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">3</font></a> the spirits, the science of sciences, the teacher of the</p>

 <p>teaching of the angels, and the source of all knowledge.</p>  
 <p>4. And the progress, too, of the pure religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers is through the righteous man, as is shown of him in revelation thus: 'I created, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân! the righteous man who is very active <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and I will guard his hands from evil deeds; I <i>will</i> also have him conveyed unto those who are afterwards righteous and more actively wise <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 5. And <i>at</i> the same time the religion of me who created him is his desire, <i>and</i> it is the obtainment of a ruler which is to be changed by the well-organised renovation <i>of the universe</i> <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>6. As through wisdom is created the world of righteousness, through wisdom is subjugated every evil, and through wisdom is perfected every good; and the best wisdom is the pure religion whose progress is that achieved by the upholders of religion, the greatness of the best men of the righteous, in whose destiny <i>it is</i>, such as that which <i>was</i> shown about Gâyômar<i>d</i>, Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and Sôshâns <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="sbe18012.htm#fr_62">20:3</a> K35 has 'obedience to' by inserting a medial stroke in dâni<i>s</i>nŏ, which converts it into <i>s</i>invi<i>s</i>nô, but is probably a mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="sbe18012.htm#fr_63">21:1</a> M14 and J here insert 'I will guard his mind from evil thoughts, his tongue from evil-speaking.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="sbe18012.htm#fr_65">21:3</a> M4 and J have '<i>and</i> it is the obtainment of a ruler who is a wise upholder of religion, from time to time, even unto the change of the last existences by the well-organised renovation <i>of the universe</i>.' But the additional words appear to have been suggested by the word 'ruler' being taken literally, whereas it seems to have been figuratively applied to the religion which is to rule the righteous till the future existence.</p>
