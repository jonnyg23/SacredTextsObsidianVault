 <p>1. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is responsible, as the manuscripts merely indicate the beginning of each question and reply.</p>  
 <p>2. Italics are used for any English words which are not expressed, or fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the sense of the translation.</p>  
 <p>3. Italics occurring in Oriental words, or names, represent certain peculiar Oriental letters (see the 'Transliteration of Oriental Alphabets' at the end of this volume). The italic <i>d</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>v</i> may be pronounced as in English; but <i>g</i> should be sounded like j, <i>h</i><i>v</i> by like wh, <i>k</i> like ch in 'church,' <i>s</i> like sh, and <i>z</i> like French j.</p>  
 <p>4. In Pahlavi words the only vowels expressed in the original text are those circumflexed, initial a, and the letter ŏ; italic <i>d</i> is written like t, <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> like n or the Avesta o, <i>v</i> and <i>z</i> like <i>g</i>, and <i>z</i><i>d</i> like â in the Pahlavi character (see the latter part of § 1 of the Introduction).</p>  
 <p>5. In the translation, words in parentheses are merely explanatory of those which precede them.</p>  
 <p>6. For the meaning of the abbreviations used in the notes, see the end of the Introduction.</p>  
 <p>7. The manuscripts mentioned are:--</p>  
 <p>BK, an old imperfect copy of K35 written in Kirmân, but now in Bombay.</p>  
 <p>J (about 60 years old), belonging to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji in Bombay.</p>  
 <p>K35 (probably written A.D. 1572), No. 35 in the University Library at Kopenhagen; upon the text of which this translation is based.</p>  
 <p>M5 (written A.D. 1723), a MS. of miscellaneous texts in Persian letters, No. 5 of the Haug Collection in the State Library at Munich.</p>  
 <p>M14 (a modern copy of a MS. in the library of the Parsi high-priest in Bombay), No. 14 in the same Collection.</p>  
 <p>TD, a MS. of the Bundahi<i>s</i> belonging to Môbad Tehmuras Dinshawji in Bombay.</p>
