 <p>1. The fifth question is that you ask thus: Why does evil always happen more <i>to</i> the good than to the bad?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that not <i>at</i> every time and every place, <i>and</i> not <i>to</i> all the good, does evil happen more--for the spiritual welfare of the good is certainly more--but in the world it is very much more manifest <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 3. And the reasons for it are many; one which is conclusive is even this, that the modes</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>and causes of <i>its</i> occurrence are more; for the occurrence of evil is more particularly appointed (vakhtŏ) by two modes, one by the demons, the appointers of evil, <i>and</i> one by the vile, the doers of evil; even to the vileness of creation and the vile they cause vexation. 4. Moreover, incalculable is the evil which happens to the vile from the demons, and that to the good from the demons and also from the vile, and the mode of its occurrence is in the same way without a demon.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, is more particularly such as the ancients <i>have</i> said, that the labour and trouble of the good are much more in the world, and their reward <i>and</i> recompense are more certain in the spiritual <i>existence</i>; and the comfort and pleasure of the vile are more in the world, and their pain <i>and</i> punishment in the spiritual <i>existence</i> are more severe. 6. And this, too, is <i>the case</i>, that the good; through fear of the pain and punishment of hell, should forsake the comfort and ease in the world, and should not think, speak, <i>or</i> do anything improper whatever. 7. And through hope for the comfort and pleasure in heaven they should accept willingly, for the neck <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a>, much trouble <i>and</i> fear in the practice of virtue in thought, word, <i>and</i> deed.</p>  
 <p>8. The vile, through provision with temporary enjoyment <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">2</font></a>--even that enjoyment of improprieties for which eventually there is hell--then enjoy themselves</p>

 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>therein temporarily, and lustfully on account of selfishness; those various actions also, through which <i>there</i> would be a way to heaven, they do not trouble themselves with.</p>  
 <p>9. And in this way, in the world, the comfort and pleasure of the vile are more, and the anxiety, vexation, despondency, and distress of the good <i>have</i> become more; the reason is revealed by the stars <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

The 'season of Srôsh' may perhaps mean the night-time, or the three nights after death, when the protection of the angel Srôsh is most wanted; but Dastûr Peshotanji Behramji, the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay, prefers reading zîmânash (with a double pronominal suffix), and has favoured me with the following free translation of the whole passage:--'At every time and every place much evil does not happen <i>to</i> all the good; for the good, after having been separated from this world, receive (as a reward for their suffering evil) much goodness in the next world, which goodness is (regarded as) of a very high degree in religious doctrines (srôsh).'
