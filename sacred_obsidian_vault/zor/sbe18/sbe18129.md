 <p>The following emendations depend upon the meaning to be attached to the word vâspôharak, or vâspûharak, which in Mkh. I, 7 was traced to Pers. bâ, 'with,' and sipihrah, 'sphere, world, universe,' and supposed to mean 'world-renowned,' being rendered by vikhyâtimat in Sanskrit. The objections to this etymology are that Pers. bâ is Pahl. a<i>v</i>âk (not vâ), which is nearly always replaced by Huz. levatman, and that vâspûhar appears to be the correct form of the word vaspûr, which explains the Huz. barbêtâ, literally 'son of the house' in the Pahlavi Farhang (p. 9, ed. H.); the latter word having been the highest title of the Persian nobility, probably confined to the heads of seven families (see Nŏldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, pp. 71, 501). Such nobles are called barbêtân in the Hâ<i>g</i>îâbâd inscription, line 6, and vâspûharakan in the Naq<i>s</i>-i Rustam inscription, line 6; they may perhaps be styled 'princes,' and their title, vâspûhar, may be traced to the ancient Persian equivalent of Av. vîsô puthra (Vend. VII, 114), literally 'son of the village or borough.' It may be noted, however, that the word 'sphere' does really occur in a form very similar to this title, in the word aspiharakânîkîhâ, 'as regards the spheres,' in Dd. 88, 4.</p>
