 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eighty-first question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>As to</i> a man who shall order a ceremonial <i>and</i> shall give the money (diram), and the man who shall undertake his ceremonial</p>  
 <p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a></p>  
 <p>and shall take his money, <i>but has</i> not performed the ceremonial, what is then the decision and what is then the decision <i>about</i> the man who ordered the ceremonial?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the merit of a ceremonial not performed is not set going, and does not come to the soul of the undertaker who shall take money for it, <i>nor</i> even <i>to</i> that of the orderer who gave money for it. 3. But, <i>as to</i> him who is the orderer, since his mental meritoriousness is so steadfast that he gave his money, the efficacy (tûban) of the good work, mentally his own, <i>has</i> not stayed <i>away</i> from him, because he gave money authorisedly for the good work; the decision, then, <i>about</i> him is such as <i>about him</i> to whom harm occurs in performing a good work for the religion. 4. It is said that the angels so recompense him that he does not consider it as <i>any</i> other harm; and as much as the good money given <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the sacred feast <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>and</i> ceremonial is then the pleasure <i>which</i> comes unto his soul, as much as would have been possible to arise in the world from that money.</p>  
 <p>5. And he who shall take his money, and did not perform his ceremonial, is just as though he had abstracted from the angels <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the righteous guardian spirits, <i>and</i> destroyed, as much propitiation as would have been possible from that ceremonial; and he is, therefore, overwhelmed by it <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and expiates <i>it</i> in the soul.</p>
