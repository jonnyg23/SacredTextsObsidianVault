 <p>1. The thirtieth question is that which you ask thus: When a soul of the righteous goes on to heaven, in what manner does it go; also, who receives it, who leads <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>it</i>, and who makes it a household attendant <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>? Also, does any one of the righteous in heaven come out to meet it, and shall any thereof make enquiry of it, or how? 2. Shall they also make up an account as to its sin <i>and</i> good works, and how is the comfort and pleasantness in heaven shown to it; also, what is its food? 3. <i>Is it</i> also their assistance which</p>

 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>reaches unto the world, or not? And is the limit (sâmânŏ) of heaven manifest, or what way <i>is it</i>?</p>  
 <p>4. The reply is this, that a soul of the righteous steps forth unto heaven through the strength of the spirit of good works, <i>along</i> with the good spirit <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is the escort (parvânakŏ) of the soul, into <i>its</i> allotted station and the uppermost (tâyîkŏ) which is <i>for</i> its own good works; <i>along</i> with the spiritual good works, without <i>those</i> for the world, and a crown and coronet <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">2</font></a>, a turban-sash and a fourfold fillet-pendant  <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">3</font></a>, a decorated robe (<i>g</i>âmakŏ) and suitable equipments, spiritually flying unto heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), or to the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân), there where its place is. 5. And Vohûman  <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the archangel, makes it a household attendant (khavag-î-mânînê<i>d</i>ŏ) to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator, <i>and</i> by order of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> announces <i>its</i> position (gâs) and reward; <i>and</i> it becomes glad to beg for the position of household attendant of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, through what it sees and knows.</p>  
 <p>6. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator of good producers</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (dahâkân) is a spirit even among spirits, and spirits even <i>have</i> looked for a sight of him; which spirits are manifestly above worldly existences  <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 7. But when, through the majesty <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the creator, spirits put on worldly appearances (vêni<i>s</i>nŏîhâ), or are attending (sinâyânîkŏ) to the world and spirit, and put away appearance (vêni<i>s</i>nŏ apadŏ<i>g</i>ênd), then he whose patron spirit (ahvô) <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">3</font></a> is in the world is able to see the attending spirits, in such similitude as when they see bodies in which is a soul <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or when they see a fire in which is Varahrân <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">5</font></a>, or see water in which is its own spirit <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 8. Moreover, in that household attendance, <i>that</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>has</i> seen the soul is certain, for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sees all <i>things</i>; and many even of the fiend's souls <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">7</font></a>, who are put away from those of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in spiritual understanding, are delighted by the appearance (numû<i>d</i>anŏ) of those of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>

 <p>his intimate friends, of the same religion and like goodness, speak to him <i>of</i> the display of affection, the courteous enquiry, and the suitable eminence from coming to heaven, and his everlasting well-being in heaven.</p>  
 <p>10. And the account as to sin and good works does not occur unto the heavenly <i>ones; it is</i> itself among the perplexing questions of this treatise, for the taking of the account and the atonement for the sins of a soul of those passed <i>away and</i> appointed unto heaven happen so <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">1</font></a>, although its place (gâs) is there <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">2</font></a> until the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, and <i>it has</i> no need for a new account. 11. And that account is at the time the account occurs; <i>those</i> taking the account are Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, Vohûman, Mit<i>r</i>ô, Srôsh, and Rashnû, and they shall make up the account of all with justice, each one at his own time, as the reply is written in its own chapter <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>12. <i>As to</i> that which you ask concerning food, the meals of the world are <i>taken</i> in two ways: one is the distribution of water in haste, and one is with enjoyment (aûrvâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) to the end; <i>but</i> in heaven there is no haste as to water, and rejoicing with much delight <i>they</i> are like unto those who, as worldly beings, make an end of a meal of luxury (aûrvâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîkîh). 13. To that also <i>which</i> is the spiritual completion of the soul's pleasure <i>it</i> is attaining in like proportion <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and in its appearance to worldly beings <i>it</i> is a butter of the name of Maî<i>d</i>yôk-zarem <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 14.

 <p>that name of it is this, that of the material food in the world that which is the product of cattle is said <i>to be</i> the best (pâshûm), among the products of cattle <i>in use</i> as food is the butter of milk, and among butters that is extolled as to goodness which they shall make <i>in</i> the second month of the year <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and when Mit<i>r</i>ô <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">2</font></a> is in the constellation Taurus; as that month is scripturally (dînôîkŏ) called Zaremêyâ <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the explanation of the name to be accounted <i>for</i> is this, that its worldly representative (andâ<i>z</i>ako) is the best food in the world.</p>  
 <p>15. And <i>there</i> is no giving out of assistance <i>by</i> the soul of the righteous from heaven and the supreme heaven  <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for, <i>as to</i> that existence full</p>

 <p>of joy, <i>there</i> is then no deserving of it for <i>any</i> one unless each one is fully worthy of it. 16. But the soul has a remembrance of the world and worldly people, <i>its</i> relations <i>and</i> gossips; and he who is unremembered and unexpecting (abarmarva<i>d</i>) is undisturbed, and enjoys in his own time all the pleasure of the world as it occurs in the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, and wishes to attain to it. 17. And, in like manner, of the comfort, pleasure, and joy of the soul, which, <i>being</i> attained in proportion, they cause to produce in heaven and the supreme heaven, its own good works of every kind are a comfort and pleasure such as <i>there</i> are in the world from a man who is a wise friend--he who is a reverent worshipper--and other educated men, to her who is a beautiful, modest, <i>and</i> husband-loving woman--she who is a manager (ârâstâr) under protection--and other women who are clever producers of advantage <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 18. This <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">2</font></a>, too, <i>which arises</i> from beasts of burden, cattle, wild beasts, birds, fish, and other species of animals; this, too, from luminaries, fires, streams (hû-ta<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nân), winds, decorations, metals, and coloured earths; this, too, which is from the fences (pardakânŏ) of grounds, houses, <i>and</i> the primitive lands of the well-yielding <i>cattle</i>; this <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">3</font></a>, too, which is from rivers, fountains, wells, and the primary species of water; this, too, which is from trees and shrubs, fruits, grain, and fodder, salads, aromatic herbs, <i>and</i> other plants; this, too, which is</p>

 <p>the preparation of the land for these <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">1</font></a> creatures <i>and</i> primitive creations; this, too, from the species of pleasant tastes, smells, and colours of all natures, the producers of protections <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the patron spirits (ahûân), and the appliances of the patron spirits, can come unto mortals.</p>  
 <p>19. And what the spirit of good works is in similitude is expressly a likeness of stars and males, females and cattle, fires and sacred fires, metals of every kind, dogs, lands, waters, <i>and</i> plants  <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 20. The spiritual good works are attached (a<i>v</i>ayûkhtô) to the soul, and in the degree and proportion which are their strength, due to the advancement of good works by him who is righteous, <i>they</i> are suitable as enjoyment for him who is righteous. 21. He obtains durability thereby <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">4</font></a> and necessarily preparation, conjointly <i>with</i> constant pleasure and without a single day's vexation (ayômaê-bêshîhâ).</p>  
 <p>22. There is also an abundant joyfulness, of which no example is appointed (vakhtô) in the world from the beginning, but it comes thus to those who are heavenly ones <i>and</i> those of the supreme heaven; and of which even the highest worldly happiness and pleasure are no similitude, except through the possession of knowledge which is said <i>to be</i> a sample <i>of it</i> for worldly beings.</p>

And of <i>its</i> indications by the world the limited with the unlimited, the imperishable with perishableness, the consumable with inconsumableness are then no equivalent similitudes of it <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 24. And <i>it is</i> the limited, perishable, and consumable <i>things</i> of the world's existence which are the imperishable <i>and</i> inconsumable <i>ones</i> of the existence of endless light <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the indestructible <i>ones</i> of the all-beneficial and ever-beneficial space (gûn<i>g</i>) <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the all-joyful <i>ones</i>--without a single day's vexation--of the radiant supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô). 25: And the throne (gâs) of the righteous in heaven and the supreme heaven is the reward he obtains first, and is his until the resurrection, when even the world becomes pure <i>and</i> undisturbed; <i>he</i> is himself unchangeable thereby, <i>but</i> through the resurrection he obtains what is great and good and perfect, <i>and</i> is eternally glorious.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_197"></a><a href="sbe18038.htm#fr_198">63:2</a> It is doubtful whether the verb be yezrûn (a corruption of yezderûn) or dezrûn (a corruption of dedrûn), but both forms are traceable to the same Semitic root (‏ו ?D?B?R‎), one with and the other without the prefix 'ye,' and both, therefore, have nearly the same meaning.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_198"></a><a href="sbe18038.htm#fr_199">63:3</a> Reading khavag-î-mân, 'servant of the house' (see also §§ 5, 8, Chaps. XXXII, 7, XXXVII, 16, 17, 21, XLIII, 1, XLVIII, 41). This word occurs in Pahl. Vend. XIX, 102, in a compound which is doubtfully read avîdamânkarânŏ, 'those acting without time, eternal ones,' in Haug's Essays, p. 388 (it should be 'those acting as household attendants'). It also occurs in the Pâzand tract called Aogemadaê<i>k</i>â, from its initial word (see Geiger's ed. p. 23, § 11), where it is read a<i>ñ</i>dimânî, and translated by Sans. pratîhâra, 'doorkeeper;' but in a Pahlavi version of this tract (which seems to form part of the Afrîn-i Dahmân, and differs considerably from the Pâzand text) this word is replaced by bôndak mânîk-i, 'a household servant,' which confirms the reading adopted here.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_202"></a><a href="sbe18038.htm#fr_203">64:4</a> Vend. XIX, 102-107 (trans. D.) states as follows: 'Up rises Vohu-manô from his golden seat; Vohu-manô exclaims: "How hast thou come to us, thou holy one, from that decaying world into this undecaying one?" Gladly pass the souls of the righteous to the golden. seat of Ahura Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a, to the golden seat of the Amesha-spe<i>n</i>ta's, to the Garô-nmânem, the abode of Ahura Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a, the abode of the Amesha-spe<i>n</i>tas, the abode of all the other holy beings.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_205"></a><a href="sbe18038.htm#fr_206">65:3</a> The ahvô (Av. ahû) seems to be a spiritual protector, somewhat similar to a patron saint; as, according to the Ahunavar, the most sacred formula of the Parsis (see Bd. I, 21. Zs. I, 12-19), both an ahû and a ratu are to be chosen, that is, both a patron spirit and a high-priest.</p>
