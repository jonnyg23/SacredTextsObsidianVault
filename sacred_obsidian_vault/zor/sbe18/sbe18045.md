 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the thirty-seventh question and reply, that which you ask is thus: The measure that they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>measure good works <i>with being</i> revealed <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">1</font></a>, how is it then <i>when</i> there is more, or not, done by us?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that every thought, word, and deed whose result is joy, happiness, and commendable recompense--when a happy result is obtainable, and the exuberance (afzûnŏ) of thought, word, and deed is important--is well-thought, well-said, and well-done <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 3. And for him the result of whose wish for good works is conclusively joy and exaltation of soul--which are his attainment of recompense from the constantly-beneficial space <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the immortal <i>and</i> unlimited, which shall never perish--there is no measure of the multitude of good works. 4. For every one by whom many are performed, and <i>who</i> engages in still more, appropriates the result more fully, and is more worthy; <i>but</i> it is not obtained for the completion of that which is a <i>definite</i> measure, therefore he does not obtain still more, and it is not necessary <i>he should</i>; and it is, moreover not obtained even for the completion of a limit of unlimitedness <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

XIII, 2-4, XXIV, 5, 6); if the good works exceed the sins by a very small quantity the soul is supposed to go to the ordinary heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), but if by a quantity sufficient to balance one unatonable sin it goes to the best existence, or supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô, see Sls. VI, 3, 4). M14 and J have merely: 'The measure for good works <i>being</i> revealed.'</p>

VIII, 4), and no limit can be assigned to the quantity that can be thus absorbed.</p>
