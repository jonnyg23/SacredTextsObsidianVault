 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the forty-sixth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: At a sacred feast (myazd) <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">3</font></a> of those of the good religion, in which <i>there</i> are fifty or a hundred men, more or less, just as it happens, and seven men who are <i>engaged</i> in the performance of the religious rite (dînô) which is celebrated by them are feasting together with them, of those seven men there are <i>some</i> who are easily <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">4</font></a> able to pray five sections (vîdak) <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and <i>some</i> six subdivisions (vakhshi<i>s</i>nŏ), of the Avesta, <i>but</i> no chapter (fargar<i>d</i>ŏ) <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">6</font></a> of the commentary (zand) is</p>

 <p>easy to them; and all seven of them are disputing about the right (râs) to the foremost places. 2. And he to whom thirty chapters in <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">1</font></a> the commentary are easy speaks thus: 'The foremost place is mine, and it became my place owing to great retentiveness <i>of memory</i>, for I know the commentary well and "the proper <i>and</i> improper <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">2</font></a>;" and my place must be good, for whenever I do not indicate this as the place of religion unto the people I am not in the security of religion; <i>but</i> you should not dispute about my place, for <i>it</i> is not becoming to dispute <i>it</i>, because this neglect and outlandishness (an-aîrîh), which <i>some one</i> brings constantly into the religion, is not <i>due</i> to me.' 3. Those seven men, moreover, speak constantly unto him thus: 'Our place is <i>more</i> important and must ever be <i>so</i>, for every man of us is able to pray several sections in his own officiating priestly duty (zôtîh), <i>and</i> it is ever necessary to consider who is more participating in sharing a reward.' 4. Then <i>as to</i> those whose Avesta is very easy, or him who knows the commentary <i>and</i> 'the proper <i>and</i> improper' well, and <i>their</i> goodness and greatness, as asked by us in this chapter, direct <i>some one</i> to make <i>them</i> clear unto us, for when he demonstrates the littleness and greatness in this</p>

 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>  
 <p>subject his great religion is then completely an advantage.</p>  
 <p>5. The reply is this, that, as to that which you ask <i>me</i> to write, so that they may decide <i>whether</i> thirty chapters in the commentary are easier, <i>or</i> really the other, be they five <i>or</i> be they six sections of the Avesta, are easier, <i>there</i> is no deciding, because which are the chapters and which the sections? 6. For, as regards more cleverness and less cleverness, it is not clear; there are <i>some</i> of the sections greater than many sections, and there are chapters <i>as</i> great <i>as</i> many chapters, but to understand severally the divisions (buri<i>s</i>) and enumeration of him to whom five sections of the Avesta are easy, <i>and</i> also of him whose thirty chapters in the commentary are easy, it is necessary for making the calculation to consider every single division in the commentary as <i>equivalent to</i> seven <i>equal</i> divisions apart from the commentary <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 7. And it is thereby thus manifest who <i>has</i> skill <i>in the one</i> and who <i>has</i> skill <i>in the other</i> <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and whoever <i>has</i> less, when there is nothing in it regarding which <i>he</i> is otherwise <i>than</i> when the superintending command <i>of</i> rulers (khtû<i>d</i>âyân) delivered over to him the place of duty--or on account of a new officiating priestly duty or directorship (ra<i>d</i>îh) of the season festivals <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or the</p>

 <p>foremost places <i>being</i> occupied, or like causes he becomes otherwise--is fit for all the great share <i>and</i> very good estimation of the place of <i>one</i> much more skilful, when their <i>being</i> fitting <i>and</i> skilful, or <i>their</i> excess <i>or</i> deficiency, is not specially manifest from their skill <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 8. And him to whom the commentary is very easy, <i>having</i> prayed much, it <i>has</i> seemed important to consider more thriving proportionable to <i>his</i> eating <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>9. And great and ample respect for both their ways of worthiness is an advantage <i>and</i> fully necessary, skill in the commentary <i>and</i> that in the Avesta <i>being</i> together mutually assisting; for even the solemnizers of the Avesta <i>have</i> need for information from the commentary about the scattered (parvand) 'proper <i>and</i> improper' <i>usages</i> of the sacred ceremony. 10. The more efficient information from the commentary is advantageous when the ceremonial is proceeded with by them, and one of those two is one of the skilful, <i>and</i> a friend, provider, glorifier, and aggrandizer for the other; and the friends of religion are good friends and, therefore, also providers of fame for both of them.</p>

 <p>11. When, too, they are publishing accusing statements, one about the other, from necessity, or from the violence which is owing to the adversary <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>it</i> is important to become an excuser as regards them, and not a diminisher of their share, <i>nor</i> a bringer (âkhtâr) of unhealthiness to <i>their</i> united strength.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_572">155:3</a> The sacred feast consists of the consecration of the sacred cakes (see Chap. XXX, r), followed by that of wine and fruit with the recitation of the Âfrîngân or blessings (see Haug's Essays, p. 408), after which the consecrated food and drink are consumed by those present, both priests and laymen.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_573">155:4</a> That is, they know the prayers by heart, which is necessary in reciting the Avesta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_574">155:5</a> Compare Pers. vaî, vîd, vîdâ, 'part, little,' <i>g</i>uz, 'a portion, a bundle of folios.' M14 has nask, 'book,' but this is clearly an unlucky guess.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_575">155:6</a> The chapters of the Vendidâ<i>d</i> are called fargar<i>d</i>s, as are also <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a> those of the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Ya<i>s</i>t and many of the lost Nasks or books. The text here applies the term specially to the chapters of some scripture with commentary, and it may be noted that the thirty; fargar<i>d</i>s, subsequently mentioned, are the exact number contained in the Vendidâ<i>d</i> and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Vast taken together, the learning of which by heart (as the word 'easy' implies) is a very serious task, comparable with learning the whole Greek text of the four Gospels.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_576">156:1</a> Perhaps 'with' is meant, but the word used is pavan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_577">156:2</a> See Chap. XLIV, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_578">157:1</a> The reason for this difference is that it is only necessary to learn the words of the Avesta, without understanding them, whereas a knowledge of the Zand, or commentary, implies understanding both texts as well as knowing the Avesta by heart.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_576"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_579">157:2</a> M14 omits the repetition of the words mûn afzâr, but it seems necessary for the completion of the idiomatic phrase.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_577"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_580">157:3</a> The six Gâsânbârs or Gâhambârs are festivals, each held for five days, and severally ending on the 45th, 205th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the Parsi year. They were probably <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a> intended originally to celebrate the periods of midspring, midsummer, the beginning of autumn, the beginning of winter, midwinter, and the beginning of spring (see Sls. XVIII, 3), when the Parsi year was fixed to begin at the vernal equinox. In later times they were supposed to commemorate the creations of the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, and man.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_581">158:1</a> The meaning, seems to be that a priest once acknowledged as pre-eminent is not to lose his right of precedence merely because others become rather better qualified, so long as he himself does not retrograde, or is not superseded in his official duties. But if through any accidental circumstance he be excluded from the chief seat, he ought not to dispute the matter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_579"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_582">158:2</a> Or, perhaps, 'through being moderate in his eating.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_580"></a><a href="sbe18054.htm#fr_583">159:1</a> The evil spirit.</p>
