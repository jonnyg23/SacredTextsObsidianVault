 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the fifty-eighth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: For how much property is it then necessary to appoint an adopted son?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that when the property which <i>has</i> remained his for whom it is necessary to appoint an adopted son is as much as sixty stîrs <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">2</font></a> of income, <i>it</i> is then indispensable to appoint an adopted son for him. 3. Even when <i>it</i> is less they should recognise him whose adoption is needful, <i>and who</i> conducts an adopted son's duty; and, similarly, an adoption is to be appointed for him, though it may not come as a possession unto him who is fittest for adoption.</p>
