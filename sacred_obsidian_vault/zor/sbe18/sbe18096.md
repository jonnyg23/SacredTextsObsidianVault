 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eighty-eighth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: When a man resolves within himself thus: '<i>In</i> the summer <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_953"><font size="1">1</font></a> time I <i>will</i> go into Pârs, and will give so much money for the high-priesthood, on account of the fires <i>and</i> other matters which are as greatly advantageous,' though he himself does not come into Pârs, <i>but</i> sends the money according to his intention, <i>or</i> in excess of it, unto the high-priests--so that he is like the great <i>who</i> send in excess of that unto the high-priests <a name="fr_957"></a><a href="#fn_954"><font size="1">2</font></a>--that, as the benefit is greater which is more maintained, they may provide for the fires of every kind <i>and</i> other matters, is then his proceeding of sending to Pârs, for that purpose, a sin, or not?</p>

 <p>of his travelling himself, any one whom he sends in his place, more particularly on <i>that</i> account, is not acceptable by the approval of the angels who <i>have</i> realized the affliction in <i>his</i> good thought, but the good work is to be eagerly well-considered. 3. Good gifts, and every office (gâs) about good works which it is possible to perform, are what are commendable <i>in</i> the well-housed <i>man</i> that is not able to work <i>himself</i> <a name="fr_958"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">1</font></a><i>; they are</i> avoidable by him when not of good race, and are not indispensable for him whenever the good work is not announced. 4. When able to manage <i>it</i> himself <i>it</i> is better; and when otherwise, his appointment of a faithful <i>person</i> over <i>its</i> preparation, and <i>his</i> accomplishment of the work of selector are expedient.</p>
