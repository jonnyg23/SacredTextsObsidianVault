 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the seventy-seventh question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>As to</i> the nature of the heinousness <i>and</i> sinfulness of committing adultery, <i>and</i> the worldly retribution specified <i>for it</i> in revelation,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>will</i> you then direct <i>some one</i> to point out to us the modes <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">1</font></a> of retribution for it?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that it is adultery, heinous <i>and</i> vicious, which first Dahâk <i>used</i> to commit, and <i>he</i> is known by the illicit intercourse which <i>was</i> his desire with Va<i>d</i>ak <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who <i>was his</i> mother, in the life-time of Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">3</font></a>, who <i>was</i> his father, without <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">4</font></a> the authority of Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp, who was the husband of Va<i>d</i>ak whose practising of sin, unauthorisedly <i>and</i> injudiciously, <i>was</i> itself heinous <i>and</i> very frequent. 3. And its modes <i>of</i> theft or spoliation are just as much more heinous than other theft <i>and</i> spoliation as a man <i>and</i> that which arises from his procreation of man are greater than the position of property.</p>  
 <p>4. One is this, that <i>it</i> is important to consider with steadfastness the courtezan life of the adulteress <i>and</i> the bad disposition assuredly <i>and</i> undoubtedly therein; she causes pillage unauthorisedly, and in <i>her</i> practice, also, intercourse during menstruation, owing to <i>its</i> resembling the burning of seed, is a frightful kind of handiwork (dastô).</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. One is this, that it may be <i>that</i> she becomes pregnant by that intercourse, <i>and has</i> to commit on her child <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">1</font></a> the murdering of progeny.</p>  
 <p>6. One is this, that it may be in pregnancy, <i>by</i> her coming to intercourse <i>with</i> another man, <i>that</i> the living child which is in her womb has died through that intercourse.</p>  
 <p>7. One is this, that it may he that she becomes pregnant by that intercourse, <i>and</i> the pregnancy <i>having</i> given indications, through shame or fear she swallows a drug <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">2</font></a> [and seeks a remedy, and murders the child in <i>her</i> womb.</p>  
 <p>8. One is this, that it may] be that a woman who is foreign or infidel, and becomes pregnant by that intercourse, gives birth to a child, <i>and</i> it has grown up with the child which is known <i>to belong to</i> the husband of the woman, <i>and</i> remains in foreign habits (an-aîrîh) or infidelity. 9. The committer of the illicit intercourse is as unobservant and grievously sinful as <i>he</i> who shall lead <i>his</i> own child from his native habits (aîrîh) and the goad religion into foreign habits and infidelity; as to the sin which that child may commit in childhood <i>he</i> is the sinner, and as to that which it may commit in manhood <i>he</i> is equally sinful with it. 10. Also, if that child be put to death in childhood, <i>and</i> be passed through water, rain, <i>or</i> fire, <i>or</i> be buried in the well-yielding earth <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>he</i> is an equally vicious murderer, <i>and</i> is defiled thereby through <i>being</i> the invisible causer.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Likewise, if he who is a man of the good religion accustoms a woman to illicit intercourse, <i>and</i> through adultery a child is born and grows up, even then to practise undutifully that which undutifulness committed is to make a wretched <i>and</i> clandestine connection. 12. On account of the birth <i>having</i> occurred through illicit intercourse <i>it</i> is grievously sinful; through propriety <i>it</i> is praise<i>worthy</i>, and through falsity <i>it</i> is sinful <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> it is said that a bastard is not appointed in superintendence over <i>any one</i>. 13. <i>If</i> it be done so that pregnancy does not occur, even then every single time--not to mention the text (a<i>v</i>istâk) <i>as to</i> the matter regarding the destruction of his own living <i>seed</i> <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">2</font></a>--<i>it</i> is <i>a sin of</i> two Tanâpûhars, which are six hundred stîrs <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and regarding that emission <i>it</i> is inexpiable (atanâpûhar) <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>14. As much on account of the conversation as on account of the companionship <i>of</i> the man who goes unto various women, for the sake of a man's sin, and is unatoning, <i>should</i> his own body be also defiled with bodily refuse (hîgar-hômônd) <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or <i>should</i> those kinds of harm be not <i>kept</i> away from another <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">2</font></a>, even then every single time of the bodily refuse bringing harm to his own body is <i>a sin of</i> sixty stîrs <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and through making his own body defiled with bodily refuse is each <i>time a sin of</i> sixty stîrs; and if he washes with water that defilement with his own bodily refuse, or that which is harmed <i>thereby</i>, every single time <i>it</i> is <i>a sin of</i> six hundred <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">4</font></a> stîrs.</p>  
 <p>15. And if it be a foreign or infidel woman, apart from the sinfulness <i>about</i> which <i>I have</i> written, <i>it</i> is a sin of sixty stîrs on account of not controlling the sins <i>and</i> vicious enjoyment of the foreign woman. 16. And, finally, the other various sins which are owing to <i>this</i> sin are very numerous, <i>and</i> grievous to thousands of connections, and <i>it</i> is thereby contaminating to them <i>in</i> a fearful manner.</p>  
 <p>17. The retribution is renunciation <i>of sin</i> in procuring pardon; and the renunciation in his turning from equally grievous disobedience <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">5</font></a>, every single</p>

 <p>time that <i>he turns</i> from similar viciousness, and as an atonement for the sin, is to arrange, or order, four (arbâ) marriages of the next of kin to his own wife, lawfully, authorisedly, and most hopeful of offspring. 18. Through fear of the grievous sinfulness which <i>I have</i> recounted, <i>in case of</i> a child of those of the good religion who has no giver of shame <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_862"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and to keep lawfully in subjection a child who is under control, he who is unnurtured is lawfully given nurture, <i>and</i> is nominated for lawfully bringing up. 19. And to turn a man <i>or</i> woman of bad disposition, by eulogy and entreaty, or <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>by</i> distress (fangîm) and fear and other representations, from that bad disposition <i>and</i> vicious habit; to order next-of-kin marriage <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">3</font></a> and all the religious rites (hamâk dînô), the Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the ceremony <i>in honour</i> of the waters <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and the <i>presentation of</i> holy-water to the fires <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">6</font></a>; to remove the burden of offspring <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">7</font></a> which is distressing those of the good religion, and to force them from the infidelity acquired, which is a very atoning atonement for such sins, are extremely proper proceedings (a<i>v</i>îr-farhakhtîkîh).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_848"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_851">228:3</a> This is the name written Khrûtâsp in Bd. XXXI, 6, which is a Pâz. reading, though confirmed by the Pahl. form in TD (as Udaî is, to some extent, by the Pahl. Aû<i>d</i> of TD). This Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp, whose name can also be read Khûrûtâsp, must be distinguished from his namesake, the father of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose name became corrupted into Lôharâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 28, 29).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_849"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_852">228:4</a> K35 omits a<i>v</i>îk, 'without,' here, but has it in Chap. LXXII, 5. Without this particle the meaning would be 'who <i>was</i> the high-priest of his father, Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_850"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_853">229:1</a> M14 has '<i>and</i> with the assistance of another man <i>she has</i> so to commit on her child of that pregnancy.' The interpolation is clumsy, and does not make the sentence easier to translate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_851"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_854">229:2</a> The passage which follows, in brackets, is from M14; there being evidently something omitted from K35 at this point.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_852"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_855">229:3</a> The contamination of water, rain, fire, or earth, by contact with <a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a> a corpse, being considered a heinous sin (see Sls. II, 9, 50, 76, XIII, 19).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_853"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_856">230:1</a> That is, procuring the birth of a legitimate child is highly meritorious, but an illegitimate birth is sinful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_854"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_857">230:2</a> Referring probably to Vend. VIII, 77-82, which states that the voluntary waste of seed is an inexpiable sin, as mentioned at the end of this section.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_855"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_858">230:3</a> A Tanâpûhar (Av. tanuperetha) sin was originally one that required the sinner to place his body at the disposal of the high-priest, in order to atone for it; but it was not necessarily a sin worthy of death, or mortal sin. At the time when the Vendidâ<i>d</i> was written, such a sin was punished by two hundred lashes of a horse-whip or scourge (see Vend. IV, 72). Subsequently, when the Vendidâ<i>d</i> scale of punishments was converted into a scale of weights, for estimating the amounts of sins and good works, a Tanâpûhar sin was estimated at three hundred stîrs (στατήρ) of four dirhams (δραχμή, ) each (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight of 600 stîrs was probably about that of 840 rûpîs, or 21 3/5 lbs. (see Chap. LII, r n).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_856"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_859">230:4</a> That is, a sin which cannot be atoned for even by giving up tae's body for execution. Anâpûhar in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 82.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_857"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_860">231:1</a> See Chap. XLVIII, 19.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_858"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_861">231:2</a> M14 has 'or he does not wash those harmful kinds of bodily refuse,' which is inconsistent with what follows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_859"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_862">231:3</a> This is the estimated weight of a Khôr sin, originally the crime of inflicting a severe hurt, ranging from a bruise to a wound or broken bone not endangering life (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight was probably equal to that of 84 rûpîs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_860"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_863">231:4</a> M14 has 'three hundred.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_861"></a><a href="sbe18085.htm#fr_864">231:5</a> Reading asrû<i>s</i>tîh as in M14, instead of the aîtrôî<i>s</i>tŏîh of K35. Possibly the latter word might be read 3-trôî<i>s</i>tŏîh, 'the <a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a> passing away of the three <i>nights</i>,' referring to the Av. phrase thrity<i>a</i>u khshapô thrao<i>s</i>ta, 'on the passing away of the third night,' in Hn. II, 18; the three nights are those immediately after death, while the soul is supposed to remain hovering about the body, thinking over its sins, and dreading the approaching judgment of the angel Rashnu; but previous renunciation of sin would relieve it from much of this dread.</p>
