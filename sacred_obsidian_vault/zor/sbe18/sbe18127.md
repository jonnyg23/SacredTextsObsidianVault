 <p>THE controversy between Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar and his brother, Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, of. which the Epistles of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar are the only portion extant, turned chiefly upon the meaning to be attached to Vend. VIII, 271-299 <a name="fr_1689"></a><a href="#fn_1683"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and whether the mode of purification therein detailed was a sufficient substitute, or merely a preparation, for the Bareshnûm ceremony. The following is a translation of the Pahlavi version of this passage <a name="fr_1690"></a><a href="#fn_1684"><font size="1">2</font></a>:--</p>  
 <p>Pahl. Vend. VIII, 271. 'O creator! how are those men purified, O righteous Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who shall stand by a corpse, in a distant place, upon a wild spot <a name="fr_1691"></a><a href="#fn_1685"><font size="1">3</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>272. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'They are purified, O righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t!'</p>  
 <p>273. 'But when so? [that is, how will <i>such a one</i> become clean?]'</p>  
 <p>274. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, <i>has</i> attacked that corpse, (275) <i>the man</i> shall then purify over his own body with bull's urine, (276) thirty times by washing forwards [<i>with</i> the bull's urine], <i>and</i> thirty times by washing over <a name="fr_1692"></a><a href="#fn_1686"><font size="1">4</font></a>, [and</p>

 <p><i>his</i> hand shall rub over it.] 277. Of the topmost <i>part</i> of him is the washing over, [that is, the washing of his head is that regarding which <i>there</i> is a mention through this study-causing (hûshkar) exclamation.] <a name="fr_1693"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>278. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, <i>has</i> not attacked that corpse, (279) <i>he shall purify</i> fifteen times by washing forwards, <i>and</i> fifteen times by washing backwards, [and <i>his</i> hand shall rub over it:]</p>  
 <p>280. 'He shall run the first mile (hâsar) <a name="fr_1694"></a><a href="#fn_1688"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 281: He shall then run forwards, [when the Pa<i>n</i><i>k</i>adasa ("fifteen <i>times</i>") shall be performed by him.] 282. <i>And</i> when he shall thus stop opposite any one whomsoever of the material existence <a name="fr_1695"></a><a href="#fn_1689"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (283) thus <a name="fr_1696"></a><a href="#fn_1690"><font size="1">4</font></a>: "I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by thought, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by word, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by deed, [that is, <i>it</i> is not possible for me <i>to be</i> as <i>though</i> washed.] 284. It demands purification for me, [that is, wash me thoroughly!]" 285. When he runs, the first he shall reach, (286) if they do not grant him purification, share one-third of that deed of his, [that is, of all that sin, not possible for him <i>to bear</i>, except when they shall perform <i>his purification</i>, one <i>part</i> in three is theirs at <i>its</i> origin.]</p>  
 <p>287. 'He runs the second mile [while he runs for</p>

If they do not grant him purification, (290) they share a half <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1691"><font size="1">1</font></a> of that deed of his, [that is, of all that sin, not possible for him <i>to bear</i>, except when they shall perform <i>his purification</i>, as <i>it were</i> a half is even for them at <i>its</i> origin.]</p>  
 <p>291. 'He shall run the third mile [while he runs for <i>it</i>]. 292. When he runs, the third he shall reach, (293) if they do not grant him purification, share all <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1692"><font size="1">2</font></a> that deed of his, [that is, all that sin which <i>it</i> is not possible for him <i>to bear</i>, except when they shall perform <i>his purification</i>, is ever <i>theirs</i> at <i>its</i> origin.]</p>  
 <p>294. 'He shall then run forwards <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1693"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 295. He shall thus stop opposite <i>some people</i> of the next house, village, tribe, <i>or</i> district, <i>and</i> he shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (296) thus: "I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; (297) I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by thought, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by word, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by deed, [that is, <i>it</i> is not possible <i>to bear</i> without washing.] 298. It demands purification for me, [that is, wash me thoroughly!]" 299. If they do not grant him purification, he shall then purify over his own body with bull's urine, <i>and</i> also with water; thus he shall be thoroughly purified over <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

II, iii, 2) meant 'washing over, backwards, or downwards.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1688"></a><a href="sbe18127.htm#fr_1694">456:2</a> The hâsar was 'a thousand steps of the two feet' (see Bd. XXVI, s, note), and was, therefore, about an English mile.</p>

This was the opinion of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, but it is based upon a Pahlavi commentary, and not upon the Avesta text, which is not clear upon this point.</p><p></p><hr>
