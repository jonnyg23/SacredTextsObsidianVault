 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the forty-first question and reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>As to</i> him who remains in the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, <i>whom</i> men shall make the protection and assistance of the good religion <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>who</i> shall save men from a foreign faith and irreligion (akdînôîh), and then holds back <i>some</i> of those who have the idea that they should go over to a foreign faith and irreligion, <i>and</i> they do not go over to the foreign faith, <i>but</i> become steadfast in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, what is then <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">5</font></a> the</p>

 <p>nature of the decision of the angels <i>about</i> him, and what is the nature of their (the men's) good works <i>and</i> sin?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>he</i> is much extolled, happy, exalted, of great good works <i>and</i> abundant recompense, and the path to the best existence, prepared (frârâstŏ) by his righteousness, is wide <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">1</font></a>; the delight of <i>his</i> soul becomes complete, <i>and its</i> hope <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">2</font></a> is great. 3. And every good work that is manifested in the good religion by those who are transferred by him from a foreign faith and irreligion, and <i>which</i> they shall do thereafter--when, through the perseverance <i>and</i> praise exercised by him who is protected by the religion, they are saved <i>from</i> irreligion--becomes his as much as though it had been set going by him himself, and <i>he has</i> the same praise and the same good works with them. 4. Of the extent (sâmânŏ) <i>and</i> amount of such good works <i>there</i> is no writing a second time, unless <i>his</i> acquaintance with the full computation of the good works due to <i>their</i> number is continuous <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">3</font></a>; but when <i>in</i> the same way they are practising and steadfast in sin it shall not be assigned <i>to him</i> <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5. Then his position in</p>

 <p>righteousness <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">1</font></a> is very grand, and in the world he has himself great eminence, applause, <i>and</i> dignity.</p>  
 <p>6. And as much as that which is an improper law <i>and</i> a law worthy of death is a punishing of the soul, and the disconnected <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">2</font></a> words and perversion (va<i>s</i>takîh), due also to the perfidy (rangi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the fiend <i>who has</i> come, are such that in his time the religious rites (dînô) performed are rites of grievous vexation <i>and</i> fear, <i>so</i> that which is a proper law, like the great glorification in spirit and the connected words of the high-priests, is the arrival of the good spirit as much as a virtue worthy of recompense <i>and</i> full of hope. 7. Even as that which is said thus: 'Of men who are practisers of good deeds the manifestation is then in their children.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_517"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_519">139:4</a> Some one placed in authority, such as a high-priest or judge, is evidently meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_518"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_520">139:5</a> Reading êdîna<i>s</i>, 'then of him,' instead of ayûf, 'or;' the <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a> two words being alike in Pahlavi except in the latter part of the last letter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_519"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_521">140:1</a> That is, his path to heaven over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge is rendered wide and easy by his good deeds (see Chap. XXI, 5).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_520"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_522">140:2</a> Reading aîmê<i>d</i>; M14 has khîm, 'disposition,' and K35 has khimâ<i>d</i>, which suggests 'shall be greatly celebrated' as a possible translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_521"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_523">140:3</a> The meaning appears to be that their good works are imputed to him only so long as he continues to exercise some control over them.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_522"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_524">140:4</a> That is, their sins will not be imputed to him in the same way as their good works.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_523"></a><a href="sbe18049.htm#fr_525">141:1</a> Or, perhaps, aharûbŏîh may here mean 'the righteous existence' or heaven.</p>
