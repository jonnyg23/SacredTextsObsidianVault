 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the forty-third question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>There is</i> a man who is super-intending (avar-mândakakŏ) and skilful, in whom great skill as regards religion is provided, and the high-priest's duty and officiating priest's duty (magôpatîh) are performed by him; or they are not performed by him, but in him great skill as regards</p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>religion is provided. 2. In a place of <i>that</i> district there is no one who rightly knows the commentary <i>and</i> 'the proper <i>and</i> improper <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' so that he comes forth into a place of such decay (sapakhân); <i>and</i> the people of the district--who constantly order all the religious rites (dînô <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">2</font></a>) of many sacred ceremonies from any poor <i>man</i> of the various persons from other districts whose skill and superintending are not <i>like</i> his, but they constantly come <i>to</i> that district--shall constantly receive <i>from him</i> all the many religious rites and many sacred ceremonies. 3. <i>And</i> that man, who is revered and skilful, proceeds not undejectedly (lâ ana<i>s</i>kandîhâ) and bashfully <i>to</i> his own superintending position, the position of the religion and position of the skill which are his; he does not demand any employment in the district or any award (dînâ) from the district, and does not know how to provide any other employment or award, in which there would be <i>any</i> fitness for him, 4. Are the people of the district--on account of the skill and activity which that man has exercised in religion, due to the performance of all the religious rites and sacred ceremonies which they constantly order--</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>thereupon to prepare that man a stipend (bâhar) <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and is it necessary for them to give a stipend to that man, or how is it necessary to act; and is 'it necessary for them to collect <i>it</i> for him, or not? 5. And of the much advantage of all the religious rites and work is it necessary to speak thus 'Until the <i>time</i> that thou hadst come it was not possible for us to order except of him who is inferior to thee,' or how is <i>it</i> to be done? 6. Is it necessary to collect a stipend for him on account of the benefit and reasoning thought (vîrmatŏ) on other subjects, of which <i>he was</i> the means, or how is it necessary <i>for</i> the superintendent <i>of</i> our people to collect such stipend of skill, position, and religion?</p>  
 <p>7. The reply is this, that a man of such description as written <i>above</i>, and superintending the exercise of skill and provision of ability, is very worthy of a stipend and courtesy (khûpîh); also, through good management of all religious rites <i>and</i> the ceremony of the sacred beings, <i>he</i> is very confident in any uncertainty. 8. Therefore it is necessary to consider that he manages more openly and better than those whose skill and ability are not <i>like</i> his; and also as regards stipend and reasoning thought, owing to the worthiness of the ceremony of the sacred beings, his are more whose skill, ability, and activity in religion are greater. 9. And <i>as to</i> a man who is as written <i>above</i>--when all those religious rites and ceremonies are well-managed by him, and his repeated direction and right continuance of proper duties are an accumulation of his own reasoning</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>thought and great capability, and are ordered of him with great solicitude--<i>one</i> is also to consider him a stipendiary <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">1</font></a> thereby, and a thriving acquirement of ample reasoning thought. 10. And <i>as to</i> him, moreover, who is less skilled than he, <i>and</i> of inferior position, by as much as he is not <i>so</i> worthy, <i>his</i> custom is therefore to produce a want of himself again.</p>  
 <p>II. But he who <i>has</i> much skill should have <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">2</font></a> a great stipend, and he of medium ability should have <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">2</font></a> a medium <i>one</i>, he <i>having</i> less means of benefiting worthily, maturely, and necessarily. 12. And the value is as it is said in revelation thus: 'The stipend they should announce to him who is an upholder of religion is two shares, <i>and</i> to him who is mediocre <i>only</i> one, to him whose lot is inferior.'</p>  
 <p>13. That man is a master <i>and</i> high-priest <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">3</font></a> whose usage also (âîn-î<i>k</i>ŏ) is wise, and in ability, goodness, and skill is the best of <i>those of</i> the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, which is the religion of wise upholders. 14. And the exercise of his religious disposition--originally possessing a religious stipend--which they shall order of him in <i>that</i> place, and that <i>of</i> the other worthy <i>ones and</i> applicants in the place and coming applying to the place, as much</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>as it is worth <i>and</i> happens <i>to be</i> their own want, <i>one</i> is to altogether thoroughly well consider for him. 15. Good destiny is not fulfilled by granting <i>to</i> those applying, <i>but</i> through forward ability, the forward, kind-hearted <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> extreme skill provided, <i>and</i> grand position he is worthy of much stipend, <i>and</i> it is important to make <i>them</i> stipendiary in their own gradation of applying. 16. For the observance of moderation <i>and</i> the granting of applications are mutually destructive, <i>and</i> it is discriminatively said that the high-priest <i>G</i>âmâsp of the Hvôvas <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">2</font></a> considered, in that mode, the much skill of that good superintendent <i>being</i> without a stipend <i>as</i> not disproportionate, <i>but</i> most justly very moderate.</p>  
 <p>17. Moreover, to collect <i>for</i> all except for one skilful <i>man</i>, and to provide a stipend <i>for</i> any other applicants, is not right; and the limits should be <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">3</font></a> moderate, for each one really shares the moderate apportionments according to his own want, apart even from the sacred ceremony. 18. But to collect for such a man, who <i>has</i> kind-heartedly superintended by rule during reasoning thought, is a greater good work than to approve even him <i>who</i> is superintending much more authoritatively. 19. And he who <i>has</i> himself requested is to obtain everything last; for, except <i>in</i> that <i>case</i> when a virtuous doer <i>has</i> in any</p>

 <p>mode begged a livelihood <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>and</i> is not capable <i>of earning it</i>--so that something even of the righteous gifts <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">2</font></a> of clothing is begged by him--to live in idleness is not the way to be assisted; <i>but</i> he who <i>has</i> not himself requested, and is wise, is to beg a suit of clothes (rakht-hanâ).</p>  
 <p>20. They give to the good provider of gifts much praise, <i>and</i> for the preservation of the perfect giver are many religious friends <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> the position of the upholders of religion <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">4</font></a>; so it is necessary to give, <i>and</i> to consider <i>it</i> as provided for the great female whom revelation greatly celebrates <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that patron spirit (ahû) connected with religion, as it is said that in the opinion of Hûmân <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the high-priest, the propitious religion is, as <i>it were</i>, the way of saving their souls <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>

 <p>21. About upholders of religion, and a more particular rule how the lawful computation should be for glorifying with moderation, a chief of the priests <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>has</i> spoken thus: 'Shouldst thou be our father in wealthiness, I am thy protector in body, <i>and</i> thou becomest thy protector in soul <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>22. The same collection <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the way of the friends of religion for begging from the upholders of religion the preservation of the soul, <i>and</i> for well considering, extremely gracefully <i>and</i> fully reverently, the advantage <i>and</i> pleasure of the position <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the upholders of religion, so that they shall properly collect for the preservation of souls by the mode of going to collect thoroughly with great gain.</p>

XXIV, 5, XXXVII, 117). She is described in Vend. XIX, 98-101, and more fully in Hn. II, 22-32 and the later Pahlavi works.

 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe18051.htm#fr_555">150:6</a> Probably some one nearly contemporary with the author, such as Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i> son of Hêmî<i>d</i> (see Bd.
