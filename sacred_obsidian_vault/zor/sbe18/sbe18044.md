 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the thirty-sixth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: How shall they produce the resurrection, how do they prepare the dead, and when the dead are prepared by them, how are they? 2. When it is produced by them, is an increase in the brilliance of the stars, moon, and sun necessary, <i>and</i> does it arise, or not? are <i>there</i> seas, rivers, <i>and</i> mountains, or not? and is the world just as large as this, or does it become more <i>so</i> and wider?</p>  
 <p>3. The reply is this, that the preparation and production of the resurrection are an achievement <i>connected</i> with miracle, a sublimity (rabâîh), and, afterwards, also a wondrous appearance unto the creatures who are uninformed. 4. The secrets and affairs of the persistent creator are like every mystery and secret; excepting himself--he who is <i>capable</i> of all knowledge, the fully-informed, and all in all (vispânŏ vispô)--no one of the worldly beings and imperfect spirits <i>has</i> known them.</p>  
 <p>5. A true proverb (gôbi<i>s</i>nŏ-gô) of the intelligent <i>and</i> worldly, which is obvious, is that as it is easier in teaching to teach again learning <i>already</i> taught <i>and</i> forgotten than that which <i>was</i> untaught, and easier to repair again a well-built house, given gratuitously, than that <i>which</i> is not <i>so</i> given, so also the formation <i>again</i> of that which <i>was</i> formed is more excellent (hunîrtar), and the wonder is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>less, than the creation of creatures. 6. And through the wisdom and glory <i>of</i> the omniscient and omnipotent creator, by whom the saddened (âlîkhtŏ) creatures <i>were</i> created, that which <i>was</i> to perish is produced again anew, <i>and that which was</i> not to perish, except a little, is produced handsome even for a creation of the creator <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. He who is a pure, spiritual creature is made unblemished; he, also, who is a worldly creature is immortal and undecaying, hungerless and thirstless, undistressed and painless; while, though he moves (<i>g</i>undê<i>d</i>ŏ) in a gloomy, evil existence, the fiend is rightly judging from <i>its</i> arrangement (min nivâr<i>d</i>ŏ) <i>that it</i> is not the place of a beneficent <i>being</i>, but the place of an existence <i>which</i> is deadly, ignorant, deceiving, full of malice, seducing, destroying, causing disgrace; making unobservant (aûbêngar), and full of envy. 8. And his existence is so full of malice, deceit, seductiveness, unobservance, destructiveness, and destruction that <i>he has</i> no voice except for accomplices (ham-bû<i>d</i>îkân) and antagonists, except also for his own <i>creatures and</i> gossips when <i>their</i> hearts are desirous of evil, seducing, destroying, making unobservant, causing malice, and bearing envy. 9. And <i>he</i> is disclosed (vishâ<i>d</i>) from his own origin and abyss full of darkness, unto the limits of darkness <i>and</i> confines of the luminaries; and in his terribleness and demoniacal deliberation he gazes at the unblemished light and creatures of the beneficent Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 10. And through abundant envy and complete maliciousness is his lying; and he mounts (sûbârê<i>d</i>ŏ) to seize, destroy,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>render unobservant, and cause to perish <i>these</i> same well-formed creatures of the sacred beings. I1. And owing to his observance of falsehood he directed falsehood <i>and</i> lies with avidity (varenô), which were necessary for obtaining his success in his own rendering <i>others</i> unobservant (aûbênŏ); even in the nine thousand winters (hazangrôk zîm) <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a> of falsehood that which is disregarded therein is his own falsity.</p>  
 <p>12. He who is the most lordly of the lords of the pre-eminent luminaries, and the most spiritual of spirits, and all <i>the beings</i> of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator--who was himself capable of an effectual (tûbânŏ) gain for every scheme of his <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a>--do not allow that fiend into the interior, into the radiance (farôgî<i>d</i>) of the luminaries. 13. And <i>they</i> <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">3</font></a> understood through <i>their</i> own universal wisdom that fiend's thoughts <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">4</font></a> of vileness, and <i>meditation</i> of falsehood</p>

 <p><i>and</i> lies, and became aware <i>of them</i> by themselves and through their own intuition, and shall not accept the perdition (aôshîh) of the fiend, <i>but</i> are to be rightly listening to the commands of him <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">1</font></a> who is worthy. 14. For his <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">2</font></a> is not the nature of him who is good, <i>nor</i> the wisdom of him who is propitious; and he does not turn from the confines of the shining ones, and the developments pertaining to those of the good <i>being</i> <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">3</font></a>, until he arrives at the creatures; and he struggles in an attempt (aûzmânŏ), spreads forth into the sky, is mobbed (garôhagî-aît) in combats, is completely surrounded, <i>and</i> is tested <i>with</i> perfect appliances. 15: His resources, also, are destroyed, <i>his</i> internal <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">4</font></a> vigour is subdued, <i>his</i> weapons of falsehood are disregarded, and <i>his</i> means of deceiving shall perish; and with completeness of experience, thorough painfulness, routed troops, broken battle-array, and disarranged means he enjoys on the outside the radiance of the luminaries with the impotence (anaîyyâragîh) of a desire which again returns to him.</p>  
 <p>16. And the same well-shining light of all kinds of the creator, when they shall not let in him who is Aharman, shall remain an unlimited time, <i>while</i> the fiend is in household attendance on those of the frontier through not being let in, <i>and</i> constantly troubled at the everlasting creatures. 17. The household attendance of the fiend seemed to it <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">5</font></a> perpetually afflicting; and also the previous struggle</p>

 <p>of the fiend when the celestial spirit (ahvô) <i>pertaining</i> to the luminaries <i>was</i> not contended <i>with</i> by him, <i>his</i> defeat (makhîtûntanŏ) when the luminaries <i>were</i> not defeated by him, <i>his</i> infliction of punishment before sin, and <i>his</i> causing hatred before hatred <i>exists</i> are all recounted by it to the justice and judiciousness whose unchangeableness, will, persistence, and freedom from hatred--which is the character of its faithful ones--are not so <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a>, to him who is the primeval (pê<i>s</i>akŏ) creator.</p>  
 <p>18. The fiend, after <i>his</i> falsity, the struggle--on account of the fighting of the shining ones <i>and</i> the decreed keeping <i>him</i> away which <i>was</i> due to the fighter for the luminaries--<i>and</i> the ill-success of the struggle of himself and army, ordered the beating back of the worthy fighter <i>against</i> destruction, the malicious avenging again of the causer of hatred, <i>and</i> the destroyer's internal vileness and disorganisation anew of his own place. 19. He saw the beneficent actions by which, through the wisdom of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the spiritual wisdom <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">2</font></a>, within the allotted (burîn-hômônd) time, the limited space, the restricted conflict, the moderate trouble, <i>and</i> the definite (far<i>g</i>âm-hômand) labour <i>existing</i>, struggles against the fiend, who is the unlawful establisher <i>of</i> the wizard; and he returned inside to fall disarmed (asâmânŏ) <i>and</i> alive, <i>and</i> until he shall be fully tormented (pûr-dar<i>d</i>ag-hâe) and shall be thoroughly experienced, they shall not <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">3</font></a> let <i>him</i> out again in the allotted time that the fiend ordered <i>for</i> the success of falsehood <i>and</i> lies. 20.</p>

 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And the same fiend <i>and</i> the primeval (kâdmôn) demons are cast out confusedly, irreverently, sorrowfully, disconcertedly, fully afflicting <i>their</i> friends, thoroughly experienced, even with their falsehoods and not inordinate means <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with lengthy slumbers, with broken-down (a<i>v</i>asîst) deceits and dissipated resources, confounded and impotent, into the perdition of Aharman, the disappearance of the fiend, the annihilation of the demons, and the non-existence of antagonism.</p>  
 <p>21. To make the good creatures again fresh and pure, <i>and</i> to keep <i>them</i> constant and forward in pure and virtuous conduct is to render them immortal; and the not letting in of the co-existent <i>one</i> <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a>, owing to the many new assaults (pa<i>d</i><i>g</i>astŏîh) that <i>occur</i> in his perpetual household attendance <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">3</font></a> of falsity--through which <i>there</i> would have been a constant terror of light for the creatures of the sacred beings--is to maintain a greater advantage. 22. And his (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s) means are not the not letting in <i>of the fiend</i>, but the triumph arranged for him<i>self</i> in the end--the endless <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">4</font></a>, unlimited light <i>being</i> also produced by him, and the constantly-beneficial space <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>that is self-sustained--which (triumph) is the resource of all natures, races, characters, powers, <i>and</i> duties from the beginning and maturing of those of the good religion and the rushing of the liar and destroyer on to the creatures, which are requisite <i>for</i> the final, legitimate triumph of the well-directing creator, and <i>for</i> the termination of the struggles of all by the protection and recompense of the praises and propitiation performed, which are the healing of the righteous <i>and</i> the restoration of the wicked <i>at</i> the renovation. 23. Even these developments, even these established habits (da<i>d</i>-<i>s</i>ânîhâ), even these emissions of strength, even these births, even these races, even these townspeople (dihîkŏîhâ), even these characters, even these sciences <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a>, even these manageable and managing ones <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and even these other, many, special species and manners which at various periods (anbânŏ) of time are in the hope that the quantity and nature of their auxiliaries <i>may be</i> complete, and their coming accomplished and not deficient in success (vakhtŏ), are distributed and made happy by him.</p>  
 <p>24. The sky is in three thirds, of which the one at the top is joined to the endless light, in which is the constantly-beneficial space; the one at the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>bottom reached to the gloomy abyss, in which is the fiend full of evil; and one is between those two thirds <i>which are</i> below and above. 25. And the uppermost third, <i>which</i> is called 'the rampart of the supreme heaven' (garô<i>d</i>mânô drupû<i>s</i>tŏ) <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>was</i> made by him with purity, all splendour, and every pleasure, and no access to it for the fiend. 26. And he provided that third for undisturbedly convoking the pure, the archangels, <i>and</i> the righteous <i>that have</i> offered praises who, as <i>it were</i> unarmed (azenâvar), struggle unprepared and thoroughly in contest <i>with</i> the champions of the co-existent <i>one</i>, and they smite the co-existent <i>one</i> and his own progeny (gôhârakŏ) <i>already</i> described, and afford support to the imperishable state <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">2</font></a>, through the help of the archangels and the glory of the creator. 27. And, again also, in their <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">3</font></a> fearlessness they seek for the destruction of the demons and for the perfection of the creatures of the good <i>beings</i>; as <i>one</i> who is fearless, owing to some rampart which is inaccessible <i>to</i> arrows and blows, and shoots arrows at the expanse below, is troubled (bakhsê<i>d</i>ŏ) for friends below.</p>  
 <p>28. And he made a distinction in the prescribed splendour and glory for the lowermost third of the sky; and the difference is <i>that</i> it is liable to injury (pavan resh), so that the fiend, who is void of goodness, comes <i>and</i> makes that third full of darkness and full of demons, <i>and</i> shall be able to perplex in that difficulty when the thousand winters occur, and the five detested (lakhsî<i>d</i>akŏ) kinds of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>demons of life <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a> have also overwhelmed with sin those of the wicked who are deceived by the demons and <i>have</i> fled from the contest. 29. <i>But</i> they shall not let the fiend fully in, owing to the luminaries of the resplendent <i>one</i>, during the allotted time when the demons' punishing and the repentance of the wicked are accomplished.</p>  
 <p>30. And he appointed for the middle third the creatures of the world separated <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a> from, the world and the spiritual <i>existence</i>; and among those creatures <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>were</i> produced for them the managing man as a guardian of the creatures, and the deciding wisdom <i>as</i> an appliance of man; <i>and</i> the true religion, the best of knowledge <i>was</i> prepared by him. 31. And that third is for the place of combat and the contest of the two different natures <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and in the uppermost part of the same third is stationed by him the light <i>of</i> the brilliant sun and moon and glorious stars, and <i>they</i> are provided by him that they may watch <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">5</font></a> the coming of the adversary, and revolve around the creatures. 32. All the <i>sacred</i> ceremonies of the distant earth (bûm), the light, the abundant rains, and the good angels vanquish</p>

 <p>and smite the wizards <i>and</i> witches who rush <i>about</i> below them <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> struggle to perplex by injury to the creatures; they make all such assailants become fugitives <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 33. And through their revolution the ascents and descents, the increase and diminution (narafsi<i>s</i>nŏ), of the creatures <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">3</font></a> shall occur, the flow and ebb of the seas, and the increase of the dye-like <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">4</font></a> blood of the inferior creatures <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">5</font></a>; also owing to them <i>and</i> through <i>them have</i> elapsed the divisions of the days, nights, months, years, periods, <i>and</i> all the millenniums (hazagrôk zîmân) of time.</p>  
 <p>34. He also appointed unto <i>our fore</i>fathers the equipment which is their own, a material vesture, a sturdy bravery, and the guardian spirits of the righteous; and he provided that they <i>should</i> remain <i>at</i> various times in their own nature <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and come into worldly vesture. 35. And those for great hosts <i>and</i> many slaves are born, for the duties of the period, into <i>some</i> tribe; he who has plenty of offspring is like Fravâk <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">7</font></a>, he who is of the early law</p>

 <p>50.

 <p>which is no indication of learning, disputing (sitô<i>g</i>) about the nature of a righteous <i>one</i>, and many other seductive powers <i>and</i> demons helping to win, <i>were</i> made auxiliary to the doctrine of falsehood in deceiving the creatures.</p>  
 <p>55. Also, to turn his disturbance <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a> to creatures of even other kinds, <i>there</i> are demons <i>and</i> fiends of further descriptions (freh-aîtân); and for the assistance of those combatants he established also <i>those</i> afflictions (nîvakân) of many, the witches of natures for gloomy <i>places</i>, whose vesture is the radiance of the lights <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a> that fall, <i>and</i> rush, and turn below the luminaries which have to soar (vâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîkânŏ) in stopping the way of <i>any</i> little concealment of the spirits <i>and</i> worldly <i>beings</i> <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 56.

 <p>but with unbecoming hatred, lawless manner <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">1</font></a>, envy, <i>and</i> spears exposing the body <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">2</font></a>, undesirably struggle together--a perplexing contention of troublers--about the destruction of the luminaries. 58. The army of angels, judiciously and leisurely fighting for the good creatures of the sacred beings, not with premature hatred and forward spears (pê<i>s</i>-nîzahîh), but by keeping harm away <i>from</i> themselves--the champions' customary mode <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">3</font></a> of wounding--valiantly, strongly, properly, and completely triumphantly struggle <i>for</i> a victory triumphantly fought. 59. For Aharman the demons are procurers (vashîkânŏ) of success <i>in</i> the contests till the end, when the fiend becomes invisible <i>and</i> the creatures become pure.</p>  
 <p>60. Since worldly <i>beings</i> observe, explain, <i>and</i> declare among worldly <i>beings</i> the work of the spirits and knowledge of customs (rîstakŏ),by true observation, through wisdom, <i>that</i> that life (zîk) is proper when <i>it is</i> in the similitude of the true power of wisdom, <i>and</i> the visible life is undiscerning of that which is to come <i>and</i> that which is provided, so also the evidence of a knowledge of the end of the contention is certain <i>and</i> clearly visible. 61. And tokens are discernible and signs apparent which, to the wisdom of the ancients--if it extended, indeed, to a knowledge about this pre-eminent subject--<i>were</i> hidden by the fiends, who are concealers <i>of them</i> from the perception (hâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of worldly <i>beings</i>, and also from <i>their</i> coming to the perception of worldly <i>beings</i>.</p>

 <p>62. The learned high-priests who <i>were</i> founders (pâyînkânŏ) <i>of the religion</i> knew <i>it</i> (<i>the evidence</i>), and those portions of it <i>were</i> transmitted by them to the ancients which the successive realisers of it, for the ages before me (levînam), <i>have</i> possessed. 63. The deceivers <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the transmitters, who have existed <i>at</i> various times, even among those who are blessed <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>have</i> remained a mass of knowledge for me, by <i>being</i> my reminder of the mature <i>and</i> proper duty of those truly wise (hû-<i>k</i>îragânîkŏ), through the directions issuable by even worldly decision, and of so many of which I have a remembrance <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the writing of which <i>there would be</i> no end. 64. Then the manifest power of the fiend among us below, and the way provided by the creator for <i>his</i> becoming invisible <i>and his</i> impotence are clear; so also the full power of the creator of the army of angels, assuredly the procurers of success <i>in</i> the end, and <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">4</font></a> the accomplishment all-powerfully--which is his own advantage--of the completely-happy progress, for ever, of all creations which are his creatures, are thereby visible <i>and</i> manifest; <i>and</i> many tokens and signs <i>thereof</i> are manifestly clear.</p>  
 <p>65. One is this, that the creator is <i>in</i> his own predestined (bagdâ<i>d</i>akŏ) abode, and the fiend is</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>advancing <i>and has</i> rushed in, and his advancing is for the subjugation of the creation <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>66. One, that the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are spiritual <i>and</i> also worldly, and that is no world of the fiend, but he gathers an evil spiritual state into the world; <i>and</i> as among so many the greed of success is only in one <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so the triumph is manifest of the good spirits <i>and</i> worldly beings over the evil spirits.</p>  
 <p>67. One is this, that <i>his</i> defeat in the end is manifest from his contention and aggression (pê<i>s</i>za<i>d</i>ârîh); for the fiend is an aggressor <i>in</i> an unlawful struggle; and leaving the army of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>--subsequently the lawful defender (lakhvârza<i>d</i>âr)--the fiend of violence is a cause of power among those wholly unrequiting the creator <i>in</i> the world <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 68. If, also, every time that he smites the creatures he is equally <i>and</i> lawfully beaten once again, it is assuredly evident therefrom that, when their beating <i>and</i> being beaten are <i>on</i> an equality together, <i>at</i> first he whose hand <i>was</i> foremost <i>was</i> the smiter, and the backward fighter was beaten; <i>but at</i> last that backward fighter is the smiter, and the foremost fighter becomes beaten <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for when he is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>beaten <i>in</i> the former combat, <i>there</i> is then a combat again, and his enemy is beaten.</p>  
 <p>69. One is this, that when the supply of weapons <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the fighting, and the ability of the contenders are equal, the supply of weapons of him who is the beginner (pê<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>âr) has always sooner disappeared, and, <i>at</i> last, he is unarmed and his opponent re-mains armed; <i>and</i> an armed <i>man</i> is known <i>to be</i> <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">2</font></a> victorious over him <i>who is</i> unarmed, just as <i>one</i> fighting is triumphant over <i>one</i> not fighting <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 70. And a similitude of it, which is <i>derived</i> from the world, is even such as when each ogle of two furious <i>ones</i> (âr<i>d</i>ŏ) of equal strength, in a fight together, has an arrow, and each one is in fear of the other's possession of an arrow; <i>and</i> one of them alone shoots <i>his</i> arrow, and makes <i>it</i> reach <i>his</i> opponent; then he is without an arrow, and his opponent, fully mindful <i>of it</i>, has an arrow, and becomes fearless through possession of the arrow, his own intrepidity, <i>and</i> the lack of arrows and complete terror of that earlier shooter. 71. And as regards mighty deeds he is successful; <i>and</i> though <i>there be</i> as much strength for the earlier fighter a successful termination is undiscoverable <i>for him</i>; despoiled of possession <i>by</i> him who is later, <i>and</i> ruined in that which is all-powerful, <i>his</i> end <i>and</i> disappearance are undoubted, clear, <i>and</i> manifest <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>72. One is this, that owing to the previous non-appearance of the fiend, the coming forward of sickness and death unto the creatures of the sacred beings <i>occurred</i> when the fiend rushed <i>in</i>, and he rendered the existence of men sickly; he also destroyed <i>and</i> put to death the progeny of animals. 73. Afterwards, through lawfully driving <i>him</i> away, sickness and death <i>come</i> in turn (bârîkîhâ) unto the demons, <i>and</i> the healthiness <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the righteous <i>and</i> perfect life unto the creatures of the sacred beings, as its counterpart is the great healthiness <i>which</i> comes, more rightly rising, unto the creatures advised by the sacred beings, through united arrangement <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 74. And, in the end, a worldly similitude of the sickness and grievous, complete death for the fiends <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and of the healthiness <i>and</i> intrinsic (benaf<i>s</i>man-<i>k</i>îgûnîh) life for the creatures of the sacred beings, is that which <i>occurs</i> when one of two litigants (ham-patkâr), prematurely revengeful, gives to <i>his</i> fellow-litigant an irritating poison, <i>and</i> himself eats wholesome flour before the later litigant gives a poison, as an antidote, to the earlier litigant, <i>and</i> himself eats the poison-subduing flour; after which he is cured <i>by</i> the poison, and his enemy is dead through the poison of the later flour <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>75. One is this, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the creator, is a manager with omniscient wisdom, <i>and</i> the contention of the fiend of scornful looks (tar nigîri<i>s</i>n) is through lust of defilement; of united power is the management of that creator, as existing with (hamzîk) <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">1</font></a> all the vigilance in the wisdom which is in everything; and that united power is the strength of the management of heaven. 76. And of much power is the contention of the fiend, as <i>his</i> manifold changing of will--which is hostile to the will of even his own creatures, and is through the weakness and exhausted <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">2</font></a> strength of an evil nature--is the contending power which forms his visible strength <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>77. One is this, that is, on account of the fiend's contending ill-advisedly, however strongly the contest is adapted for the damage of his own fiendishness, and regret and bad consequences therefrom are perceptible. 78. Such as the very paralyzing <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">4</font></a> affliction which <i>was</i> appointed (nîhâ<i>d</i>ŏ) by him</p>

 <p>for the creatures of the world in putting the living to death, which he ordered with violence and the hope that it <i>would</i> be <i>his</i> greatest triumph. 79. Even that is what is so self-damaging to the same fiend that, when he puts to death him who is wicked, and he who is wicked, who is performing what is desirable for him (the fiend)--that performance of what is desirable <i>being</i> the practice of sin--is useless <i>and</i> goes thither where he is penitent of that seduction, the spirit <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the owner (shah) of the sin, whose soul is wicked <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is righteous, in whose worldly body exist the fetters of pain and darkness; and owing to the unfettering of <i>its</i> hands <i>from</i> that pain it (the spirit) is far <i>away</i>, and goes to heaven, which is the most fortified of fortresses. 80. Fearlessly it fights for it, even as the guardian spirit of Yim the splendid <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">3</font></a> kept away all trouble (vê<i>s</i>am), the guardian spirit of Frê<i>d</i>ûn kept away even those active in vexing <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> other guardian spirits of those passed away are enumerated as <i>engaged</i> in the defeat of many fiends.</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>81. One is this, that the most grievous severance that is owing to him (the fiend) <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">1</font></a> is the production of the mortality of the creatures, in which the afflicting (nîzgûn), demon Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_384"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the head <i>of</i> the many Mâzînîkân <i>demons</i> <a name="fr_385"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 82. And the propitious creator's developers <i>were</i> thus unprovoked (anârgônd) when the only person, who is called Gâyômar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>was</i> destroyed by him, and came back to the world <i>as</i> a man and a woman whose names were Marhayâ <i>and</i> Marhîyôih <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and the propagation and connection of races <i>were</i> through their next-of-kin marriage of a sister <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 83.

 <p>increased offspring and fortune for them through death, so uplifted <i>his</i> voice in <i>their</i> presence, about the death of the living <i>ones</i> of their offspring and lineage; that <i>together</i> with the unmeasured destructiveness of the deadly evil spirit, and the unjust contention of his through death and the conveyer of death <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the sting also of birth <i>was</i> owing to death. 84. The repetitions of the cry <i>were</i> many, so that the issue (bâr) of thousands and thousands <i>of</i> myriads from those two persons, and the multitude passed <i>away</i>, from a number <i>which</i> is limited and a counterpart (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) of the living people in the world, are apparent; and for the annihilation of many fiends, through death, the propitiousness of the contending power of the creator is clear <i>and</i> manifest.</p>  
 <p>85. One is this, that the most steadfast quality of the demon himself is darkness, the evil of which is so complete that they shall call the demons also those of a gloomy race. 86. <i>But</i> such is the power in the arms <i>and</i> resources of the angels, that even the first gloomy darkness in. the world is perpetually subdued by the one power really originating with the sun <i>and</i> suitable <i>thereto, and</i> the world is illuminated <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

And every single statement of each of the truthful is as much evidence, about those several colours of those who are liars, as even the compiled sayings of the Abraham of the Christians <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which are the word of <i>him</i> who is also called their Messiah <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">4</font></a>, about the</p>

The 'endless light' is the phrase used in Pahlavi to express Av. anaghra rao<i>k</i><i>a</i>u, a term implying 'the fixed stars,' so the passage in the text is very suggestive of the phrase, 'he made the stars also' (Gen. i. 16).</p>

The epithet 'constantly-beneficial' is a Pahl. translation of Av. misvâna, and is evidently applied here to the unlimited heavenly space contained in the endless light' (see § 24) and including the supreme heaven, as appears from the order in which these three existences (the earliest creations of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) are mentioned in Chap.

 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="sbe18044.htm#fr_371">102:1</a> M14 begins a fresh argument here, owing to some misunderstanding of the meaning of the sentence.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="sbe18044.htm#fr_374">102:4</a> This appears to be a description of ordeal by poison and the two usual modes of evading its operation: The hasty evader relies upon deceitfully substituting a wholesome, powder for the <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a> poison he has to take; while the more cautious evader trusts to recognising his adversary's poison by its taste, and selecting another poison as an antidote for both to take, so that the hasty evader suffers through his own deceit in not taking the first poison.

The deluging rain of Malkôs is supposed to usher in the dreadful winter foretold to Yima in Vend. II, 46-56, when all, or nearly all, living creatures were to perish, a truly glacial epoch. In a Persian paraphrase of the Bahman Vast (see Byt. Introd. p. lix) this period of Malkôs is described as follows:--'As three hundred years have elapsed from the time of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (Byt. III, 44-49) the period of Malkôs comes on; and the winter of. Malkôs is, such that, owing to the cold and snow which occur, out of a myriad of men in the world only one will remain, and the trees and shrubs all become withered, and the quadrupeds, whether carrying, walking, leaping, or grazing, will all utterly die. Then, by command of God, they will come from the enclosure formed by Vim, and the men and quadrupeds from that place spread over Irân, and make the world populous a second time, and it is the beginning of the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar(-mâh).'</p>
