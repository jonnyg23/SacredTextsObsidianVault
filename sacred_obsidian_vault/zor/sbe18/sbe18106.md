 <p>1. That writing which comes amid the writing of your epistle is a correct fragment <a name="fr_1154"></a><a href="#fn_1150"><font size="1">1</font></a> as regards the nothing in which <i>one</i> is to change the operation properly maintainable, and it is becoming; because, if it be even for him, by whom it is written from the</p>

 <p>statements of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1151"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the several statements <i>and</i> teachings of the same high-priests, yet then the elaboration <i>and</i> publication thereof are not such as that which is sent down by his further elaboration <a name="fr_1156"></a><a href="#fn_1152"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 2. And thereby it <i>has</i> seemed manifest <i>that it</i> is sent so that a wish for the spirit <i>may</i> proceed from the truth of <i>its</i> minister (pa<i>d</i>ŏ), or <i>from</i> his thought for the desired decision; or his understanding <i>may</i> be of that kind which is warped (vukô<i>s</i>tŏ), as though he believed it as other than the exposition of the religion <i>and</i> the teaching of the high-priests. 3. But until the unparalleled arrival of Sôshâns <a name="fr_1157"></a><a href="#fn_1153"><font size="1">3</font></a> any one not sharing in complete knowledge is not appointed unto a patron spirit (ahvŏ), <i>and</i> the fiend specially contends more experimentally with the thoughts of the high-priests of the religion for a religious decision.</p>  
 <p>4. And even the recompense of community <a name="fr_1158"></a><a href="#fn_1154"><font size="1">4</font></a> of property is that when <i>one</i> gladly observes pure thoughts; <i>and</i> the swift action of voluble (pûr) speakers and kind regard of religious characters for deliverance <a name="fr_1159"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>and</i> for the noticeable undeceitfulness of the same spirit <a name="fr_1160"></a><a href="#fn_1156"><font size="1">6</font></a>--which is itself the desire of settled observation that is in it for the sake of the</p>

 <p>same kind of full religious diffusion--are the swift action of the patron spirit, which, for the sake of preparing him for a deliverance that is not falsifying revelation <i>and is</i> without disputants, is a kind regard for the deliverance itself of <i>him</i> whose spiritual life (hûkŏ) it is.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>As to</i> that which is thought by him <a name="fr_1161"></a><a href="#fn_1157"><font size="1">1</font></a> of those deliverances sent down, completed, <i>and</i> announced, I consider more particularly about the meaning of one thing, which is their solemnized observance. 6. The solemnized observance of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is in the teaching <a name="fr_1162"></a><a href="#fn_1158"><font size="1">2</font></a> of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, and those of Afarg and Sôshâns are each one meditated <i>and</i> indicated in a teaching; and the pointedly superior position of each one of them is mentioned by him in <i>his</i> statement of any teaching and <i>of</i> the decision set up. 7. Also with a kind regard for his own choice he <i>has</i> thought it (the former teaching) imperfect, and, on account of <i>what</i> was not attained by it--which <i>was</i> a re-explainer of the same good ideas provided--<i>its</i> dissimilarity to it is not unnoticed <a name="fr_1163"></a><a href="#fn_1159"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 8. <i>But</i> when <i>one</i> hears the re-explainers of a true reply he is well protected (hû-zinharî<i>d</i>ŏ) by complete mindfulness <a name="fr_1164"></a><a href="#fn_1160"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> is himself confident that the teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is not the whole statement of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, for there are many opinions of</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1151"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1155">299:1</a> The names of three of the commentators whose opinions are most frequently quoted in the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i> (see Sls. I, 3). Each of them appears to have written a complete 'teaching' or dissertation upon the ceremonial laws, from which the quotations are taken (see § 6).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1152"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1156">299:2</a> That is, in collecting the opinions of the ancients, he has twisted them so as to suit his own views.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1153"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1157">299:3</a> The last of the future apostles (see Dd. II, 10), not the commentator of the same name mentioned in § 1.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1157"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1161">300:1</a> Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam the writer of the decree mentioned in § 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1158"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1162">300:2</a> The word <i>k</i>â<i>s</i>takŏ means usually a written course of teaching or exposition, a commentary, dissertation, or manual of instruction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1159"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1163">300:3</a> Implying that Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam had been more inclined to enforce his own opinions than to examine those of the commentators.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1160"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1164">300:4</a> The Pahl. translation of Av. ârmaiti, 'devotion,' which is usually personified as a female archangel protecting the earth.</p>

It appears probable that the author had access to much more complete commentaries than the fragments now extant in the Pahlavi version of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1162"></a><a href="sbe18106.htm#fr_1166">301:2</a> Meaning, probably, that Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh was disposed to relax the rigid enforcement of the law in cases of doubt or difficulty, as the Avesta itself does in several cases.</p>
