 <p>1. If this which is said by you be a knowledge that is replete (a<i>v</i>kâr) with advantage, why was it then necessary for you to keep <i>it</i> as <i>it were</i> concealed <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">2</font></a> from me, when I thus consider that, if a knowledge should be rightly obtained by you, it should then have been needful for you to report unto me on the first rumour <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">3</font></a> from every <i>one</i> who is well-enlightened (hû-bâm)? 2. If this decree</p>

 <p>seemed so to you before, between when you have been in Pârs and this <i>time</i> when in Sîrkân, <i>it was</i> not well considered with those acquainted with the religion, the wise <i>and</i> the high-priests, <i>and</i> not even reported. 3. If not conceived by you before, then what learned acquaintance with the religion <i>was</i> acquired by you in Sarakhs <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>and</i> Shirâ<i>z</i>, about which you are enlightened? 4. And before it was to be well considered amid observation <i>and</i> meditation <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">2</font></a> what high-priest <i>was</i> obtained by you in Shirâ<i>z</i>, who, when it was well considered with him, in completely securing himself, kept you <i>away</i> from deliberation to be decided with me <i>and</i> other priestly <i>men</i> and high-priests?</p>  
 <p>5. If not decided by you in Pârs on account of breaking <i>away</i> from me, that is <i>as</i> though you yourself understand that I <i>am</i> to keep, <i>in</i> my own person, not even in the rank of discipleship unto you, but in that which is like servitude; and my coming <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1337"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which is on your account, is even an accumulation of harm <i>and</i> distrust (tars) which you <i>have</i> amassed for yourself by <i>having</i> written <i>and</i> acted, <i>and</i> has made <i>me</i> suffer sorrow (vî<i>d</i>varînî<i>d</i>ŏ) in my own person. 6. If it had been shown to me by you <i>that</i> it would be the preservation of the religion, it would then have incited me to accept <i>it</i> steadfastly. 7. If,</p>

 <p>for the sake of co-operation with me, a lawful decree had been even more privately propagated by you, and if the religious demonstration about it <i>were</i> conservative <i>and</i> correct, it would then have been less vexatious for you to explain <i>it</i> to me than to others who <i>have</i> less acquaintance with the decrees <i>and</i> declaration of revelation; <i>and</i> if a difference had arisen thereon, a correct reply would then have come to you more fully from me. 8. And if you conceive that it is not necessary to demonstrate <i>it</i> to me through the declaration in revelation, that deliverance which it is not necessary to announce is not to be so decreed, even in another place. 9. And, just as even in Pârs, <i>if it</i> were not decreed by you in Sîrkân on that account, when your conception was that they would not accept <i>it</i> from you, it <i>was</i> necessary for you to know that, because it was not possible for you to provide much interval for demonstration.</p>  
 <p>10. If <i>its</i> purport <i>be</i> now considered by you, when you are moving as to the writing from Shirâ<i>z</i> <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">1</font></a>--which writes fully <i>of</i> your acquirement and interpretation of it, and <i>of</i> a mutilated deliverance <a name="fr_1344"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">2</font></a>--the arrangements for iniquity on this subject are many. 11. And one of them is the erroneous writing <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">3</font></a> which is with me, for you conceive that they would accept from me your <i>view</i>, as <i>it were</i> swearing (sôkandîkŏ) that it does not go to the filth accumulated for <a name="fr_1346"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>12. And, persistently concealed, that <i>was</i> done by thee, owing to which is the anguish of my life; for <i>it</i> is annoying when a wound of the soul is not actually realised by means of the decree; but if, too, it should be really avoidable, <i>it</i> is then even said <i>that</i> ignorance itself would be regenerative (navazû<i>d</i>ârîhâ), since <i>it</i> is not dubious to me, unless a matured knowledge of creation and some of that even <i>of</i> the angels should be in sight <a name="fr_1347"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 13. Also through their much talking, which is like Vîsari<i>s</i> <a name="fr_1348"></a><a href="#fn_1343"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and much affliction, which is like the eradication of life, <i>there</i> is a perpetual demonstration then <i>in</i> every place of the country of Irân, where this information <i>about</i> its religion shall arrive, <i>that</i> they then consider thee as an apostate and an enemy of the religion.</p>  
 <p>14. And through this eager procedure of yours many troops in the provinces, who <i>have</i> to horse (aspînî<i>d</i>anŏ) themselves, <i>have</i> joined Âtûrŏ-pâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1349"></a><a href="#fn_1344"><font size="1">3</font></a>;</p>

 <p>for, inasmuch as those most mounted on horses <a name="fr_1350"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the washers <a name="fr_1351"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>of</i> Sîrkân, who would have always thought about their abundance which is due to the archangels, they have spoken with opponents about this interpretation of the section <i>of scripture</i> (vîdak) <a name="fr_1352"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> so become similarly testifying <a name="fr_1353"></a><a href="#fn_1348"><font size="1">4</font></a>, thus: 'We do not conceive it is necessary to demand thy reason <i>for</i> this most grievous disaster <a name="fr_1354"></a><a href="#fn_1349"><font size="1">5</font></a>, a thing which is more complete through your elucidation of doubt and the power of the enemy, owing to this way which is appointed by thee.' 15. And on that account, too, <i>it</i> is more disquieting unto me, when I am aware both of the origin <i>of</i> this perplexity <i>and</i> the surpassing contamination which is possible to arise from it.</p>  
 <p>16. And you always so observe as not to leap (la aîyyûkhtanŏ) without looking before; but temporary observation is nothing really of that <i>which</i>, by a well-stinging similitude, is what <i>one</i> observes, with the eyesight looking well forward, <i>when</i> dust of many kinds is domesticated with the sight of the</p>

 <p>eye; and if his intellect be not judicious he is wonderfully deceived by it; and <i>should</i> it be even when he mentions the existence of two moons, <i>has it</i> become more proved thereby? 17. <i>It is</i> a custom of the most provoking in itself, and presented disquietingly when I, who believe with a fervent mind, <i>would have</i> delivered the life even of <i>my</i> body over to the perplexing bridge <a name="fr_1355"></a><a href="#fn_1350"><font size="1">1</font></a> for your happiness <i>and</i> enjoyment. 18. Also, on account of my want of leisure, even the information which is presented, asking peace, is information I believe with a generous mind; and <i>being</i> aware regarding my want of leisure is both an advantage and harmful, and the heart to write of them <a name="fr_1356"></a><a href="#fn_1351"><font size="1">2</font></a> is, therefore, miraculous. 19. Then it is always necessary for me, who <i>am</i> in want of leisure, to write unto you so much writing of the harassing of annoyers <i>and</i> against disputes, of whose end there is no conception in my heart.</p>
