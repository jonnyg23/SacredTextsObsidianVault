 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the ninety-second question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: From what place should Tî<i>s</i>tar <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">1</font></a> seize the water? How does it pass into a cloud, and how does he make the cloud move on? How does it rain upon the world? How can he carry on a struggle with demons, and with which demon can he carry <i>it</i> on? How does this always happen with the. hail and snow, whenever hail and snow occur? And who can force away that hail and snow?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the high-priests have thus said, that Tî<i>s</i>tar seizes a place <i>which</i> is called 'abysmal' (vârûnak) <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_1002"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that is the last place of filtration in the ocean, <i>and</i> there are no removal of <i>any</i> kind and causing rain from any other place. 3. And the cause of its (the rain's) establishment is spiritually active, more particularly, however, through two kinds of material agency: one is that which is the role (mang) in the atmosphere of the earth, whereby it is drawn up in atoms similarly to smoke, <i>and</i> in larger masses, well-soaring from the rivers; <i>and</i> one is that <i>which</i> blows with the power of the well-operating wind, and the blowing of the great united breath (ham-vâê) and strength of the community (<i>k</i>andîgânŏîh)</p>

 <p>of spirits <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_1003"><font size="1">1</font></a>, from the fully perfect distillation (pûr-hû-zûhîgîh) of the mighty ocean to the upper <i>regions</i>, and thereby the clouds are blown.</p>  
 <p>4. Afterwards, it (the rain) speeds in the cloud, through the great strength of the mighty wind, to where <i>there</i> is a necessity <i>for it</i>, to divert <i>it</i> from where <i>there</i> is no necessity; and so long as <i>there</i> is a necessity for <i>it</i> it (the cloud) discharges. 5. And when <i>there</i> is a necessity and it causes rain, and the necessity is <i>for</i> no <i>more</i> acquisitions of water, and the advantage is the effect of water upon the place, and it distributes <i>it</i> to the existing rivers for the use of the sea, and it causes rain <i>again</i>, it thereby produces even new water, new flowing, new coming of healing to plants, new growth, new golden colouring to lands; new purification to animals, new procreation, new proper breathings for other creatures, new dawn, and new <i>things of</i> that description. 6. The thriving of the world makes the advantage <i>and</i> perfection of the good creation increase; and, apart from a great craving for the effect of the glory of the spirits in the operations of cultivation and the performance of spiritual mysteries, <i>it</i> is said labours are aided even for <i>one</i> gloriously destined.</p>  
 <p>7. And Tî<i>s</i>tar in seizing the water should seize upon the great strength of the wind of whirlwinds (gar<i>d</i>înâkân), which is figuratively (mîni<i>s</i>nîk) the dragging <i>and</i> blowing that follow the whirling; <i>and</i> the purified water is expanded <i>and</i> carried up aloft to the higher <i>regions</i> of the atmosphere, just as that</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p>which is seen where it reaches up with the heaviness and weight of earth, and then is discerned in the plain <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">1</font></a> accompanied by the dragging of the whirling wind <i>which</i> would carry <i>it</i> afar to settle like <i>that</i> which is owing to dust; it (the atmosphere) is called Andarvâê ('the intermediate air'), and the wind is a whirlwind. 8. As the water is lighter, and owing to the more strongly dragging wind on the ocean than that which exists on the plain, so, also, the water from the ocean is much more in proportion, and transportable farther up than the dust <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">2</font></a> from the plain. 9. And as in the midst of a plain a medium whirlwind of wind is expanded into the wide plain by a medium dragging of the wind, and plenty of much buffeting is the violence of the dragging of winds, a whirlwind of wind which is seen very lofty and large is unknown; so, also, <i>one</i> is ignorant of what is spreading among the movements of the sea. 10. The water of that full and abundant flowing--which is through the power and glory of the heavenly angels and Tî<i>s</i>tar's control of the work--is blown up, both by the well-characterised water-drawing power, and also by the force of <i>various</i> kinds, the dragging, and upward blowing of the winds, into the atmosphere; and thence it rains the complete rain, as they <i>have</i> recounted from observation and much full evidence.</p>  
 <p>11. The demon who resists the <i>doings</i> of Tî<i>s</i>tar--and the glorious Tî<i>s</i>tar, meeting him, properly drives back such improper resistance of his--is</p>

 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>  
 <p>a demon <i>of</i> the name of Apâôsh <a name="fr_1009"></a><a href="#fn_1006"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which is interpreted <i>as</i> 'the destruction of water' (âp-aôsh). 12. He contends, moreover, with the uppermost <i>and</i> lowermost water; and desirous of <i>its</i> destruction that demon contends at three periods: first, for the non-existence of rain; secondly, for converting <i>it into</i> a cause of damage to a place; <i>and</i> thirdly, at. the place of producing <i>it</i> with advantage; and the struggling is like a tree (vanô) which is set moving.</p>  
 <p>13. The seizers of the feminine <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_1007"><font size="1">2</font></a> pure water are a benefit <i>for the existences</i> of the whole world; and the formation of rain, and the triumph and ascendancy of Tî<i>s</i>tar over the demon, through that seizing (falânîh) of water, are due to the creator who strengthens him <a name="fr_1011"></a><a href="#fn_1008"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the archangels who have him assisted <a name="fr_1012"></a><a href="#fn_1009"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the religious who reverence him, and the worldly beings who glorify him. 14. Very properly do the archangels propitiate <i>him, and</i> mankind promote the strength and power, which are <i>engaged</i> about the business, by glorifying <i>and</i> invoking the good spirit who increases them in consequence of glorifying <i>and</i> worship, <i>and</i> through which</p>

 <p>arises that advantageousness <a name="fr_1013"></a><a href="#fn_1010"><font size="1">1</font></a> of his--which owing to that benefit is the benefit of every one else--for this advantageous business.</p>  
 <p>15. And Tî<i>s</i>tar shall gradually (pa<i>d</i>manîkîhâ) seize upon the water to distribute <i>it</i> liberally, assiduously a similitude <i>of</i> that which a learned ruler said, in extolling a wise high-priest, that, 'just as the wind draws the up-flying water from rivers and springs <i>and</i> from seas; Tî<i>s</i>tar, through his own liberality, bestows the prepared apportionments of the whole production for the advantage of the creatures <i>by</i> the will of the sacred beings, and makes <i>it</i> rain. 16. And through that which he shall purposely seize to distribute suitably he distributes the water purified, he moistens the pleasant <i>existences</i> of animals <i>and</i> plants and spares <a name="fr_1014"></a><a href="#fn_1011"><font size="1">2</font></a> the polluted, he provides for the thirsty <a name="fr_1015"></a><a href="#fn_1012"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he causes harm to the dye-like bloody <i>one</i>, and he makes the world thrive. 17. When that wide-<i>spread</i> liberality of his, the production of rain, is from the pure, healing water which he shall thus seize gradually and with just apportionment, <i>and</i> when through that acquiring of water-seizings the rivers, springs, <i>and</i> other existences (shavandagânŏ) are well-expanding, and even the diminution which is owing to the wasting (aîrîkhtagîh) of rivers and springs does not occur thereby, <i>it is</i> thus, too, the lordly, by a law (dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) moderate and varied--if the regulation (gûn) is to reach <i>away</i> from the region--are as much contributing, as</p>

The chapter appears to break off here, without any reference to the queries about hail and snow; but it is uncertain if any portion of the work be here omitted (owing to loss of folios in some older MS.) because the author does not always reply to all clauses of the questions, as may be noticed in Chap. XXXVII. One reason, however, for supposing that some of the text is here lost is the allusion, in Chaps. XVII, 20, XVIII, 2, to a chapter no longer extant in Dd.</p>
