 <p>1. The twenty-second question is that which you ask thus: When they shall snatch forth the life from the body of man how does it depart?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>it</i> is said <i>to be</i> in resemblance such as when the redness is drawn up out of a fire; for when the inflammable <i>material</i> of a fire is burnt, <i>and has</i> remained without glowing <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>and when it does not obtain new inflammable <i>material</i>, or extinguishing <i>matter</i> (nî<i>z</i>âyi<i>s</i>nîk) comes upon <i>it</i>, its redness <i>and</i> heat then depart from it <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">1</font></a>; the life, too, on the departure of the breath (vâ<i>d</i>ŏ va<i>s</i>akîh), does not stay in the body, <i>but in</i> like manner departs.</p>  
 <p>3. <i>To</i> a like purport the high-priests of the religion <i>have</i> also said this, that mortals <i>and</i> men by listening <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">2</font></a> perceive the time when the spirits shall put a noose (band) on the neck <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">3</font></a>; when his time <i>has</i> fully come <i>one</i> then conducts him with a companion (pavan ham-bar) <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and at his falling are the place of death <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">5</font></a> and cause of death; and <i>having</i> made lethargy (bûshâsp) deliver him up, and terrified his fever (tapŏ), death (aôsh) seizes decrepitude (zarmân) <i>away</i> from him <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. The strength in those intrusted <i>with him</i>, and the good proceedings <i>and</i> pursuit of means which remain behind <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">7</font></a>, giving them strength, are the determination</p>

And should it be a passing <i>away</i> (vi<i>d</i>arg) which obtains no light, and on account of their disquietudes <i>they have</i> gone to the understanders of remedies for strength for the remedial duties, and the way is closed, he proceeds with insufficiency of means <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 6. And the soul of the body, which is the master of <i>its</i> house (ka<i>d</i>ak khû<i>d</i>âî), <i>along</i> with the animating life, <i>goes</i> out of the impotent body to the immortal souls <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as a wise master of a house goes out of a foreign (anîrânŏ) house to a residence of the good worship.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>It was</i> also told to the ancient learned that life (khayâ) is where there is a living spirit within the soul's body, which is connected with the soul <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">3</font></a>, as much as a development (<i>s</i>arîtûntanŏ) of the body, and is the life (zîvandakîh) of the soul of a body of <i>one</i> passed <i>away</i>.</p>
