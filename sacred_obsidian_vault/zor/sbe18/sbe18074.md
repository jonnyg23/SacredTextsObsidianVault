 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-sixth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: What is this appearance <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is girded on the sky?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>it is</i> a mingling of the brilliance of the sun with mist and cloud that is seen, of which <i>it</i> is <i>at</i> all times and seasons, moreover, a characteristic appearance, whereby <i>it has</i> become their sign above from spiritual to earthly beings.</p>  
 <p>3. That which is earthly is the water above to which its brilliance is acceptable; and the many brilliant colours (gunakân) which are formed from that much mingling <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">2</font></a> of brilliance and water, and are depicted (mânâkî-aîtŏ), are the one portion for appearing <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
