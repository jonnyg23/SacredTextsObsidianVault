 <p>2. The epistle <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">2</font></a> which <i>was</i> wisely, properly, and with religious demeanour ordered by you, <i>and</i> sent by a courier (paîkŏ), <i>has</i> come, and <i>has</i> enveloped <i>and</i> assailed (<i>g</i>astŏ) me, indeed, with appalling intelligence on other subjects; and if even a portion <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>of</i> the vast importance and great value, as regards your heavenly <i>concerns</i>, arrangements, and natural <i>and</i> unpremeditated (avarîk) prodigies <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">4</font></a>, which are for my knowledge, for the sake of courteous (drû<i>d</i>îk) information, <i>be</i> owing to intelligence for which the courteousness <i>and</i> proper courageousness are among you, special pleasure is received <i>therewith</i>. 3.

 <p>the wise has said about <i>it</i>, that even from the management of disordered possessions which are impaired <i>there</i> is advantage through the power of wisdom; <i>and</i> they (the sacred beings) select and cleanse and uplift the good works <i>in</i> such manner as a precious stone (sag khêl) from the water, and gold brocade <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">1</font></a> from the dust.</p>  
 <p>4. My pleasure, also, is as much increased through the information clue to the same courtesy, <i>and I have</i> a new <i>and</i> great desire for the arrival of information, continuously from henceforth, about the perfect courageousness, enduring humility, good works; worshipping, favouring position, and eagerness of soul of you who <i>have</i> recounted <i>your</i> great thoughtfulness for religion <i>and have</i> provided good works.</p>  
 <p>5. On account of the universal renown (aspôharakânîh) of the good <i>people</i> of Khvanîras <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">2</font></a>, which is yours, owing to the favour that is your complete happiness, ardently <i>and</i> joyfully most desired, and constantly <i>so</i>, when <i>there</i> are opportunities of seeing you--though it is supposed <i>to be</i> the advantage of your own religion, joy of soul, courteousness, <i>and</i> proper constancy--since my will <i>resides</i> among you, you make known <i>and</i> command my actions, through the will of the sacred beings.</p>
