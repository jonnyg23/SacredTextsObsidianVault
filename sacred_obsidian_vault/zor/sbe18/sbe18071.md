 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-third question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: Whence <i>was</i> the first creation of mankind, and how was the formation of the original race of men? 2. What issued from Gâyômar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> what did it really become; and from what have Mashyâîh <i>and</i> Mashyâyôîh <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">5</font></a> arisen?</p>

And in the shape of the fire-priest <i>was</i> created by him the material existence (stih) <i>that</i> is called man, <i>and for</i> three thousand years <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">1</font></a>, when it did not progress and did not eat, it did not speak; likewise, it did not utter, but it thought of, the righteousness of the perfect <i>and</i> true religion, the desire for the pure glorification of the creator.</p>  
 <p>5. Afterwards, the contentious promise-breaker <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">2</font></a> injured the life of it, <i>and</i> produced a burdensome mortality; and the mortality is <i>clear</i> from the appellation, Gâyômar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">3</font></a>, of the nature produced. 6. The seed which <i>was</i> the essence of the life of the leader (mîrakŏ) of life, who <i>was</i> Gâyômar<i>d</i>, flowed forth on <i>his</i> passing away, came on to the earth of the beneficent angel <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> is preserved in the earth until, through the protection of the angels, a brother and</p>
