 <p>1. The nineteenth question is that you ask thus: To what place do the righteous and wicked <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">1</font></a> go?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that it is thus said that the souls of those passed <i>away and</i> of the dead <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">2</font></a> are three nights on earth; and the first night satisfaction comes to them from <i>their</i> good thoughts <i>and</i> vexation from <i>their</i> evil thoughts, the second night <i>come</i> pleasure from <i>their</i> good words and discomfort <i>and</i> punishment <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">3</font></a> from <i>their</i> evil words, and the third night <i>come</i> exaltation from <i>their</i> good deeds <i>and</i> punishment from <i>their</i> evil deeds <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 3. And that third night, in the dawn, they go to the place of account <i>on</i> Albûr<i>z</i> <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">5</font></a>; the account <i>being</i> rendered they proceed to the bridge <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and he who is righteous</p>

 <p>passes over the bridge on the ascent (lâlâîh), and if belonging to the ever-stationary (hamîstânîkŏ) <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">1</font></a> he goes thither where their place is, if <i>along</i> with an excess of good works <i>his</i> habits are correct (frârûn-dâ<i>d</i>) <i>he goes</i> even unto heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), and if <i>along</i> with an excess of good works <i>and</i> correct habits <i>he has</i> chanted the sacred hymns (gâsânŏ) <i>he goes</i> even unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânŏ). 4. He who is of the wicked falls from the lower end (tîh) of the bridge, or from the middle of the bridge; he falls head-foremost to hell, <i>and</i> is precipitated (nikûnî-aîtŏ) unto that grade <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">2</font></a> which is <i>suitable for</i> his wickedness.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_127"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_128">46:1</a> As K35 inserts the relative î here, some such phrase as 'who are dead' has probably dropped out of the Pahlavi text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_128"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_129">46:2</a> The Parsi books speak of the righteous dead as 'departed,' a term very rarely applied to the wicked (see Chap. XXXII, 4), who are nearly always said 'to die;' the latter verb is, however, occasionally used when speaking of the righteous. This distinction is made even in the Huzvâri<i>s</i> logograms, which express the death of the righteous by forms allied to Chald. ‏ו ?Oֲ?Bַ?R‎ 'he passed over,' and the death of the wicked by forms allied to Chald. ‏ו םִ?Y?Tה‎ 'he died.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_129"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_130">46:3</a> So in all MSS., but the 'punishment' seems superfluous here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_130"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_131">46:4</a> The Avesta merely states that the soul remains three nights near the body, chanting a particular hymn, and experiencing as much pleasure or uneasiness as it had in the world (see Hn. II, 3-17, III, 3-16); and much the same account is given in AV. IV, 9-14, XVII, 2-9, Mkh. II, 114, 158-160.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_131"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_132">46:5</a> The mountain chain which is supposed to surround the world (see Bd. XII, 3); the Av. Hara-berezaiti.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_133">46:6</a> The <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Chap. XXI, 2-7), which is said to <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a> rest upon the Dâîtih ('judicial') peak, and to 'pass over to Albûr<i>z</i> (see Bd. XII, 7). According to the Avesta (Vend. XIX, 100, 101, trans. D.) his conscience, in the form of a maiden, 'makes the soul of the righteous one go up above the Hara-berezaiti (Albûr<i>z</i>); above the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge she places it in the presence of the heavenly gods (angels) themselves.' See also AV. V, 1, 2, Mkh. II, 115.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_133"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_134">47:1</a> The intermediate place for those not good enough for heaven and not bad enough for hell, where such souls remain in a passive, immovable state till the resurrection (see Sls. VI, 2). It is divided into two parts, according to the author, one for those nearly righteous (see Chap. XXIV, 6), and one for those nearly wicked (see Chap. XXXIII, 2).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_134"></a><a href="sbe18028.htm#fr_135">47:2</a> Four grades of heaven and four of hell are mentioned in AV. and Mkh, (see Sls. VI, 3, note).</p>
