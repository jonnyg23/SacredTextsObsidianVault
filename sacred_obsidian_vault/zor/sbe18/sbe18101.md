 <p>with whom the misery there is not connected--is here so evil.</p>  
 <p>11. And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that that person is the more fortunate <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">1</font></a>, in whom the soundness of body, happiness, and energy (râyînisnŏ) <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <i>who</i> has done those things <i>about</i> which the last wish of him who departs from the world is then thus: 'I <i>will</i> strive to do more;' <i>and who</i> shall have exercised much complete abstinence from those things <i>about</i> which his last wish, when he departs from the world, is then such as 'I <i>will</i> strive to do less, and it would have occurred more comfortably for my soul <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>12.

 <p><a name="fn_1015"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1018">269:3</a> The first eleven sections of this chapter are quoted from the beginning of the sixth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which commences as follows:--'The propitiation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is even in the benedictions of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship; this, too, was the settled decision of those of the primitive faith. The sixth <i>book</i> is on a compendium (vasang) which <i>was</i> prepared by those of the primitive faith to maintain about the sayings of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship;' and then proceeds as in our text, with the variations and additional matter mentioned in the foot-notes. It is hardly probable that these quotations were intended as a conclusion to any reply, the beginning of which may be lost, as they refer to a variety of subjects; but they may have been selected by the author as authoritative opinions sufficiently comprehensive for his general peroration. At any rate they show that the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> must have been in existence in its present form before the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk was written. All the MSS. have this peroration written continuously with the preceding chapter, without stop or break of any kind to indicate a change of subject.</p>

And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that <i>one</i> becomes diligent about that <i>with</i> which <i>he</i> is conversant. And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that the good thoughts that are in the records of the religion of every kind <i>one should</i> always put fully into practice, so far as he understands <i>them</i>. And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, produced these creatures through <i>his</i> nature, maintains <i>them</i> through wisdom, and forces them back to himself through religion.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1051"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1055">273:2</a> The evil spirit (see Chaps. II, 11, XIX, 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1052"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1056">273:3</a> Or 'when he has done it,' which would be expressed by the same words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1053"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1057">273:4</a> Dk. omits 'indeed.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1054"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1058">273:5</a> In Dk. the following is here inserted:--'And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that people are to keep an eye most diligently on the world <i>for</i> these three things: that which is realisable <i>by</i> a sinner through sin, a follower made famous, <i>and</i> to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits: and keeping their eye on the world is said <i>to be</i> this, that <i>it is he</i> who observes himself, so that <i>a part</i> of whatever he really desires he should always perform. And this, too, <i>was</i> thus considered by them, that three <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a> things which are very difficult to do are even such as these: one is not to render the sinfulness famous by the sin; one is not to exalt the opinions of the fiend, and the various sovereignties of the evil <i>one</i>, for the sake of wealth; and one is to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits, <i>and</i> not from the world.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1055"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1059">274:1</a> Dk. has merely 'keeps.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1056"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1060">274:2</a> Dk. has 'this, too, is to be considered,' as a continuation of the preceding section.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1057"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1061">274:3</a> Dk. omits 'of light.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1058"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1062">274:4</a> The oldest MS. of Dk. has 'though <i>some</i> of the much happiness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>,' &amp;c., as in the latter part of the section, omitting the passage referring to Aharman and hell; later MSS., however, insert a modified version of the omitted passage, and read as follows: 'When even here <i>it</i> is so happy at the period when it should be distressing <i>and</i> the mischievous vexation of much pain has come; this, too, is to be considered, that misery, indeed, is the calamity (âfatŏ) there in hell, when even here <i>it</i> is so, though <i>some</i> of the much happiness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>,' &amp;c.. as before. This interpolation in Dk. is evidently modern (as the word âfatŏ is Arabic and not Pahlavi), and was probably composed by a copyist in India who was acquainted with the text of Dk.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1059"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1063">275:1</a> Dk. has 'that a person is most fortunate in that.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1060"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1064">275:2</a> M14 and J have 'are the appearance of health of body and pleasure;' Dk. has 'is the appearance of perfection.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1061"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1065">275:3</a> Dk. concludes as follows: '<i>who has</i> done those things which are done, <i>about</i> which <i>on his</i> last day--when the things of the world depart--his wish is then thus, that 'more endeavour should be made by me;' <i>and has exercised</i> much abstinence from those things <i>about</i> which his last day's wish is this, that the endeavour made should not be made.' The quotations from Dk. end at this point.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1062"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1066">275:4</a> Reading mûn, as in M14 and J, instead of amat, 'when,' (see Chap. LXII, 4 n.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1064"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1068">276:2</a> The two southern provinces of Persia, bordering on the Persian Gulf.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1065"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1069">276:3</a> This title seems to be always spelt in Pahlavi with â in the middle syllable, so that the form frama<font size="-1">DH</font>âr in Nŏldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 9, must be looked upon as an Arabic corruption, and the idea that it means 'a preceder or one who has precedence' can hardly be maintained. It probably stands for farmâî<i>d</i>âr, 'a director or commander,' not in a military sense. It occurs also in Bd. XXXIII, 2, where the title 'a great farmâ<i>d</i>âr' is evidently equivalent to 'prime minister, or grand vazîr,' but applied to a priest, as farmâ<i>d</i>âr is here and in Chap. XLV, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1066"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1070">276:4</a> Reading râs, as in M14, instead of ra, which is merely an imperfect word. This clause of the sentence is a slight modification of a well-known quotation (said to be taken from the lost part of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask) which is often used in perorations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1067"></a><a href="sbe18101.htm#fr_1071">276:5</a> Or 'who keeps to duty and shall do his duty thereby.'</p>
