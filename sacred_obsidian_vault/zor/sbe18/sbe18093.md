 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eighty-fifth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: What is possible to become the harm of a gift <i>that</i> is reduced?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that since <i>those things</i> are to be properly given which are for the religious rites of the ceremonial <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and are the consideration of the undertakers of all the religious rites, and are also the stipend of some solemnizers, both <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">2</font></a> are living comfortably <i>by</i> the ceremonial. 3. The sons of the disciples <i>who</i> wanted approval for the words prayed, become so much the more to be ordered <i>and</i> to be accepted; and the ceremonial of all the religious rites becomes more progressive.</p>  
 <p>4. So, moreover, when they go to undertake the well-operating activity of the ceremonial for a diminution of remuneration <i>and</i> gift, and owing to undertaking <i>and</i> ordering again <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">3</font></a>, by way of routine (pavan dôr râs), they do not request so much stipend, <i>it is</i> as though they should buy my linen <i>and</i> should sell <i>it</i> again for their own payment (dâ<i>d</i>anŏ). 5. <i>As to</i> the performers of the ceremonial, likewise, who <i>have</i> to acquire approval with much trouble and words prayed, and obtain a remuneration which, <i>for</i> the soul even, is as little for the ceremonial as though <i>one were</i> annoyed--whereby</p>

 <p>living is difficult--they become sorry for enduring the trouble, owing to lukewarmness (afsur<i>d</i>ŏ-mini<i>s</i>nîh) <i>in</i> the same profession. 6. And even the sons of the disciples shall sell linen for wages, and they rejoice <i>that</i> it is possible to learn other callings <i>with</i> less pains; and thus they make <i>them</i> become lukewarm <i>and</i> meditating retreat (a<i>v</i>â<i>z</i>âhang) from the words of fresh paragraphs continually prayed <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">1</font></a>, from the approval requested of the learned (â<i>z</i>ân), <i>and</i> from all the religious rites they should undertake <i>for</i> the contented.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>As to</i> those, moreover, who, through fervent-minded undertaking of <i>what</i> is ordered, request less <i>for</i> all the religious rites, <i>and have</i> not obtained <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">2</font></a> even that which is due <i>to them</i>, it is not even as though they ordered <i>of them</i> for the fiends <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 8. And the disgrace, too, of the orderers of good works of lukewarmness is the exaltation of the profession of the disciples; and its deficient progress becomes the paralysation of the ceremonial of the sacred beings for saving the souls of the good from the deadly <i>one</i> (mar).</p>
