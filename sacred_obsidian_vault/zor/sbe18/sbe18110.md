 <p>1. And <i>as to</i> that which is written <a name="fr_1210"></a><a href="#fn_1206"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that '<i>the teachings of</i> Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns <a name="fr_1211"></a><a href="#fn_1207"><font size="1">2</font></a> have all three come <i>and</i> remained, and, on that account, whoever <i>has</i> washed just as they always wash therein is certain that he is worthy.' 2. Also, 'should it have been as <i>it were</i> proper to them, would Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh have said that "not even the purifier is single?"' 3. <i>And</i> the rest as written an that subject, which, on account of its acute observation, <i>has</i> seemed <i>to be</i> from their statements; they, however, <i>have</i> not decided it so by the teaching which is in their names, as <i>was</i> indicated by me before <a name="fr_1212"></a><a href="#fn_1208"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. But I do not so understand that 'if those should have been all the particulars of the peculiarity of all three teachings, would <i>the teachings</i> of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh and Sôshâns have said, concerning any one who should have so washed that the purifier was single, that it is suitable, because the high-priests have been thus very unanimous that when</p>

 <p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p>there is one he is unsuitable <a name="fr_1213"></a><a href="#fn_1209"><font size="1">1</font></a>? 5. And when it should be to them as <i>it were</i> proper that, apart from the hands, the other <a name="fr_1214"></a><a href="#fn_1210"><font size="1">2</font></a> customary <i>parts</i> (pî<i>s</i>akŏ) <i>should be</i> washed once by them, would Afarg have said it is proper <a name="fr_1215"></a><a href="#fn_1211"><font size="1">3</font></a>, because washing them three times is not mentioned in the Avesta? 6. And when it would have been as <i>it were</i> proper that the three hundred pebbles (sang) <i>should</i> not <i>be</i> cast <i>into</i> the water and bull's urine, <i>would</i> Afarg's <i>teaching have</i> said that it is proper <a name="fr_1216"></a><a href="#fn_1212"><font size="1">4</font></a>, because there is not a single use for a pebble (sagî<i>k</i>akŏ)? 7. And when it would be as <i>it were</i> proper that <i>he who</i> is washed at the ablution seats (mak) at which any one <i>has been</i> washed <i>during</i> the length of a year, is not injured thereby--only they shall take them away <i>and they</i> are again deposited <a name="fr_1217"></a><a href="#fn_1213"><font size="1">5</font></a>--would Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh's <i>teaching</i> have said that it is proper, because, when the stones (sagŏ) are again deposited by one, <i>it</i> is to effect the cleansing (vistari<i>s</i>nŏ) of some one,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>and</i> when a <i>shower of</i> rain occurs thereon so <i>that</i> the whole place shall be thoroughly wetted, inside <i>and</i> outside, it is proper? 8. And if some one says that this is the case of a rite by a teaching of authority, and the rule is by a teaching of private authority, is not the whole rite by any teaching proper, that <i>consists</i> in this washing which is thoroughly preserved as they keep <i>it</i> in practice <a name="fr_1218"></a><a href="#fn_1214"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>9. The reply is even this, that every rite (nîrông) is to be performed <i>in</i> such manner as <i>that</i> which is said <i>to be</i> most preservative, and most connected with the declaration of revelation <i>and</i> the testimony of the high-priests <i>concerning</i> it. 10. And not for the reason that Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh's <i>teaching</i> is more preservative <a name="fr_1219"></a><a href="#fn_1215"><font size="1">2</font></a> as to one rite, and after that some-thing of Afarg is more preservative, is the operation to be performed by the statement of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh; <i>but</i> whatever is the more preservative of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh's is collected from Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, all the more preservative of Afarg from Afarg, <i>and</i> that which is the more preservative of <i>any</i> other high-priest from that which <i>has</i> the most preservative approval of the high-priest. 11. That which those high-priests <i>have</i> said, which they decide by just authority, is the commandment of the learned of the realm, which has lawfully arisen over the provinces (shôhârânŏ); but even that statement opposing it <i>which</i> is much testified <i>and</i> manifestly more of a deliverance, or which is declared <i>as</i> an exposition</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the teaching of high-priests of the religion in a dissimilar case, they shall then <a name="fr_1220"></a><a href="#fn_1216"><font size="1">1</font></a> wholly accept, and <i>they</i> are to perform the operation authorisedly <i>and</i> preservatively thereby.</p>  
 <p>12. This, too, I so consider, <i>that</i> even if each separate teaching should be as <i>it were</i> proper, it would then not be determined by them as to the impropriety of the <i>purifying</i> cup, for Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh <i>has</i> stated, only as <i>it was</i> apparent to him, that every single customary <i>part</i> is to be washed for three times <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1217"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and has</i> not specifically determined that when all shall be <i>so</i> once it is not proper. 13. By the special teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh and the washing which is in the law that says--concerning those interpreting revelation--that whoever becomes quite polluted shall thoroughly wash by that law, so that his <i>being</i> washed is to be considered as <i>being</i> washed, it (the rite) is not performed by me if, also, that other high-priest <i>has</i> said, that every one who becomes quite polluted, <i>and</i> washes not by the law of the primitive faith, is not to be considered as washed. 14. Then, too, in the special teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh <i>it</i> is not said, <i>of</i> that washing which is washed by the law of those of a portion of the religion (pârak-dînôân), that it is note proper.</p>  
 <p>15. He who washes by the law of those of the primitive faith, which many high-priests maintain as excellent, because it is suitable, <i>and</i> imagines that regarding the threefold washing it should be said that it is not proper, even he--when he also</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>has</i> become of the same opinion as to this, that the statements of the high-priests are on an equality, and the most evidence of the high-priests is the <i>right</i> course--would have attained to confidence about this, that in a doubtful matter <i>there</i> should be a high-priest <a name="fr_1222"></a><a href="#fn_1218"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and also that <i>of</i> which Afarg and Sôshâns <i>have</i> alike understood a similar thing is proper.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1207"></a><a href="sbe18110.htm#fr_1211">312:2</a> See Chap. V, 1.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1209"></a><a href="sbe18110.htm#fr_1213">313:1</a> The writer says he does not understand this argument of his correspondents, because it differs from the view he takes in Chap. VI, 2, but it must be confessed that the meaning of the passage in dispute (Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, b) is not very clear, as the word ashâye<i>d</i>, 'he is unsuitable,' can also. be read ae shâye<i>d</i>, 'he would be suitable,' both there and in our text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1210"></a><a href="sbe18110.htm#fr_1214">313:2</a> K35 has one line blank here, but this was probably owing to the state of the paper, or some inadvertence of the copyist; as it is evident that none of the text is omitted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1211"></a><a href="sbe18110.htm#fr_1215">313:3</a> Compare Chap. VI, 9-I1.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1213"></a><a href="sbe18110.htm#fr_1217">313:5</a> This shows that the places for ablution during the Bareshnûm ceremony were, a thousand years ago, the same as now, namely, stones deposited on the ground, not holes dug in the ground, as directed in Vend. IX, 13, 14, 16. They are, in fact, the stones or hard material directed to be deposited at the holes in Vend. IX, 29, 30, but they go by the old name for the holes (magh).</p>
