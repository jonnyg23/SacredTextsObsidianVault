 <p>1. For completion little is observed by me; and a man of my own, <i>in</i> a position of authority (sông gâh), comes with a second epistle <a name="fr_1243"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">3</font></a> for that priestly man, opposing, disputing, showing the harm, making</p>  
 <p>

 <p>aware of the deliverance <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and applying for arrangement. 2. And the man who comes as a co-operator is announced by me, <i>and</i> the rite which is accomplished by him is <i>so</i> till further <i>notice</i>, which is for my further epistle <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">2</font></a>; because a double elucidation about that which it is necessary to arrange from afar is a custom more suitable for the discreet.</p>  
 <p>3. If <i>that</i> same priestly <i>man</i> <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">3</font></a> should have been in the vicinity, then interviews <i>with</i> me, with a few words, <i>would have been</i> more preservative than <i>trying</i> to convert that wretchedness (vakhâr) into that which is customary (pî<i>s</i>akŏ) even by further writing and much information. 4. And even now my prospect is a well-considering demand for explanation, so that, if the duties which are suitable for the discreet <i>be</i> really disposable for it, it is proper so to arrange what it is possible for me to complete <i>for</i> three months; <i>and</i> I <i>may</i> go myself into the presence of <i>that</i> same priestly <i>man</i> for the arrangement of the indispensable duties, and <i>may</i> diffuse this arrangement properly <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5. <i>But</i> there are many reasons for private reflection (nâhî<i>d</i>ŏ) on account of which a descent from position is an evil resource; and <i>this</i> once a temporary epistle is written by me to him, and comes with this epistle <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 6. And</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pânak <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">1</font></a>, a man who is instructed <a name="fr_1250"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">2</font></a>, shall come to him, <i>who</i> is friendly to custom (âînag-îyâr), <i>and</i> of like rank with his own man who is faithful; <i>and</i> I <i>will</i> write further <i>and</i> more controversially to him, and give the information advisedly with which I <i>shall</i> acquaint him, so that <i>it may be</i> more explanatory to him.</p>  
 <p>7. But if through this which is written by me, or <i>through</i> myself <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he <i>should</i> come immediately (di<i>g</i>andyî<i>s</i>) unto Pârs, I <i>shall</i> then be seeking an opportunity even for the retirement of him himself; I do not abominate <i>it</i> (madam lâ man<i>s</i>ôm) when it is necessary for them <i>and</i> private, as is better.</p>  
 <p>8. As to these other diffusions of arrangements which are pre-eminently the resources of that priestly man, and the acquaintance with revelation which is sought by him, for the sake of the advantage of the religion they should not be molested before <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>eminence of you listeners <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the primeval religion consist in long-continued, supreme prosperity, through all happiness! then, through such thoughtful friends, the acquaintance <i>with</i> its difficult teaching and mighty words, which is to increase that gratitude of yours to me for my decisions, is made a blessing to you, if you observe therein a good idea which seems to you important, when it reaches your sight.</p>  
 <p>10. The correct writer <i>and</i> scribe is ordered that he do not alter <i>any</i> of <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">2</font></a> the words (mârîk), while he writes a fair copy of this epistle of mine, which is written by me to you, and he orders <i>some one</i> to give <i>it</i> to <i>that</i> same man, Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pânak, <i>along</i> with that epistle, so that it <i>may</i> come to him <a name="fr_1255"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for there are <i>times</i> when I seem aware that <i>it</i> is better <i>so</i>. 11. And may the angels increase <i>and</i> enlarge your many new <i>things</i> with full measure and complete exaltation! the pleasure, peace <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">4</font></a>, righteousness, prosperity, commendation, <i>and</i> happiness <i>of</i> the powerful <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1253"><font size="1">5</font></a> who are all-controlling <i>and</i> happy-ending.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1241"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1245">321:2</a> Probably referring to Ep. II, till the arrival of which (or that of Ep. III) they were to act as directed by the priest he sends with this epistle.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1244"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1248">321:5</a> Being apprehensive that personal interference might lead to altercations derogatory to his dignity, he prefers trying the effect of writing in the first place. The temporary epistle, here referred to, <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> could not have been Ep. II, as that was written after Ep. III, and was the further epistle promised in § 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1245"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1249">322:1</a> Or, perhaps, Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pahnak. This was a common Parsi name in former times, as it is found in two of the Pahlavi inscriptions in the Kanheri caves, dated A.D. 1009 (see Indian Antiquary, vol. ix, pp. 266, 267), and the very similar name, Yazd-panâh, occurs as the name of a Parsi convert to Christianity who was put to death about A.D. 541 (see Hoffmann's Auszüge aus syrischen Akten persischer Märtyrer, p. 87).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1246"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1250">322:2</a> Assuming that dinhâr<i>d</i>ŏ stands for zinhârî<i>d</i>ŏ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1248"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1252">322:4</a> Referring probably to further matters of complaint, which he did not think it advisable to notice seriously until the present controversy was settled.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1249"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1253">323:1</a> Reading nyôkhshî<i>d</i>ârânŏ, as in J, instead of avakhshî<i>d</i>ârânŏ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1251"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1255">323:3</a> To Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam. This copy was that mentioned in Ep. II, vii, I.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1252"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1256">323:4</a> Reading slam, as in J; the other MSS. have shnuman, 'propitiation,' the two words being nearly alike in Pahlavi letters.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1254"></a><a href="sbe18112.htm#fr_1258">323:6</a> The fifth day of the twelfth month of the Parsi year; and, as Ep. III (which was evidently written after further consideration) is dated in the third month of A. Y. 250, this must have been written in A.Y. 249. The date of this epistle, therefore, corresponds to the 15th March, 881.</p>
