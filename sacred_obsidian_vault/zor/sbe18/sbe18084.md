 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the seventy-sixth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: Will you direct <i>some one</i> then to make the heinousness of this sin of unnatural intercourse clear to us?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the first material creature <i>was</i> the righteous man, the smiter of the fiend, the righteous propitiator; so, also, in the world <i>he</i> is more recognising the sacred beings, more completely (hamâktar) for the production of creatures,</p>

 <p>and with more provision for the creatures <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 3. And with the manifestation of knowledge the best duty is that which <i>exists</i> in lawfully practising procreation, <i>and</i> the complete progression of righteous men arose therefrom.</p>  
 <p>4. In like manner he who is the omniscient creator formed mankind in the first pair, who were brother and sister, <i>and</i> became Mashyâîh and Mashyâyôîh <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and all races of material life <i>exist</i> by means of acquiring sons and <i>his</i> omnisciently causing procreation. 5. The man and woman <i>were</i> also made to lust (gâmîni<i>d</i>ŏ) by him, and thereby <i>became</i> the father and mother of material men; and he naturalized among primitive man the qualities of a desire (âlû<i>d</i>anŏ) for acquiring sons together through glorifying. 6. And the law <i>and</i> religion authorised it as a proper wish, so long as <i>they proceed</i> from those who are their own <i>relations</i>, not from those who are not their own; and with those whom next-of-kin marriages <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">3</font></a>, original duties, and desires for other sons have formed, complete progress in the world is connected, and even unto the time of the renovation <i>of the universe</i> <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">4</font></a>, it is to arise therefrom. 7. And the birth of many glorious practisers of the religion, those confident in spirit, organizers of the realm, arrangers of the country, <i>and</i> even accomplishers</p>

 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, which <i>arises</i> from <i>those</i> same <i>to</i> whom that practice shall be law--and when it occurs lawfully--is a miracle and benefit of the world, the will of the sacred beings and the utmost good work discernible, because the complete progress of the righteous arises therefrom, and the great female faculty (nekedîh) is manifested.</p>  
 <p>8. So when the opponent of the same, by whom the source <i>of</i> seed <i>and</i> procreation is spoiled, is intent upon a way for the death of progeny--and the intention is certain--<i>its</i> annihilation is owing to him <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and he is the devastating fiend <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whose will is a desire of depopulation and ruin, and by the power of his Nîyâ<i>z</i> (<i>demon of</i> 'want') <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">3</font></a> he turns imperceptibly the esteem of the very indispensable production of men from the position of wishing for sons to a creature <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">4</font></a> who is opposed to it, through whom have arisen its ruin <i>and</i> corruption. 9. And the nature and power which are his cherishing of progeny are not suitable for receiving seed, and misrepresented (drôkînî<i>d</i>ŏ) by him is the accompanying evil intercourse, so that emitting the seed (shûdak), in delivering <i>it</i> at that time into that burning place, full of stench, is to produce <i>its</i> death, <i>and</i> no procreation occurs.</p>  
 <p>10. The dupes <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">5</font></a> turn the living seed from mingling with women <i>and</i> seeking for births, just as in the like vice of any demon, connected with a longing</p>

 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>for the dupes <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they shall abandon that advantage of the world, the delights (vâyagânŏ) of a son <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 11. He who is wasting seed makes a practice of causing the death of progeny; when the custom is completely continuous, which produces an evil <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">3</font></a> stoppage of the progress of the race, the creatures <i>have</i> become annihilated; <i>and</i> certainly, that action, from which, when it is universally proceeding, the depopulation of the world must arise, <i>has</i> become and furthered (frârâstŏ) the greatest wish of Aharman <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 12. Such a practiser is the greatest wish of Aharman, through the demon's excretion <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">5</font></a> of doubt <i>in</i> the practice, owing to intercourse with the emitter, <i>which</i> is most filthy and most fetid, and the emitting member, which is causing death; and the demoniacal practice <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">6</font></a> is perceptible even from the same practice, and whatever is the heinousness <i>of</i> the sinfulness is clear to observers of the dead <i>body</i>.</p>
