 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-ninth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: What are these river-beds <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and what is the cause of them; whence do they always arise, <i>and</i> why is <i>there</i> not a river-bed every-where <i>and in</i> every place where <i>there</i> is no mountain?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that any place where a mountain is not discernible and a river-bed exists <i>it</i> is a fissure (a<i>s</i>kûpŏ); and it is declared as clear that, even before the growth of the mountains, when the earth was all a plain, <i>by</i> the shaking of the world the whole world became rent (zandakŏ) <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 3.

And if it has been prepared <i>in, or</i> if <i>it be</i> in a ravine (<i>s</i>ikaftŏ) of, the mountains, the cause, too, of the contraction, thundering, and tearing of a river, if <i>its</i> confinement <i>be</i> in the earth, is the resistance which it <i>meets</i> in seeking a passage; and as it is a spring of the waters of the earth, so also it is in the earth, whose contraction <i>and</i> panting are mighty <i>and</i> full of strength. 5. And when <i>it is</i> a time that they would make a constructed channel at the outside of its ravine, as regards the contraction which is within it, the resistance by which it is contracted at the outside of the ravine is the ground  <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_788"></a><a href="sbe18077.htm#fr_791">213:4</a> When the evil spirit rushed into the earth it is said to have shaken, and the mountains began to grow (see Bd. VIII, 1-5); and at the resurrection it is expected that the earth will recover its original perfect state of a level plain (see Bd. XXX, 33).</p>
