 <p>1. A well-reflecting <i>person</i>, moreover, is able to understand that which is written by me, in private, in writing unto the good <i>people</i> of Sîrkân, as perhaps a legitimate copy <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">5</font></a> of a writing of that kind from</p>  
 <p>

 <p>me <i>may be</i> near you; and it was like the production of some one for the tearing and rending of his own limbs, and for the purpose of bringing on that remedy--the burning, torturing medicine that is religious <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1360"><font size="1">1</font></a>--whose purpose is to remain <i>away</i> from the steadfast while <i>abiding</i> by the commands of religion. 2. This <i>same</i> epistle <a name="fr_1366"></a><a href="#fn_1361"><font size="1">2</font></a>, which <i>was</i> one of very great incompleteness, and one as <i>it were</i> thinking very severely, <i>was</i> similar to the decision (azad <a name="fr_1367"></a><a href="#fn_1362"><font size="1">3</font></a>) <i>to</i> which I <i>have</i> come on the same subject, <i>which is</i> written <i>of</i> below and again; and accompanying this epistle <i>was</i> a man of my own with a further epistle <a name="fr_1368"></a><a href="#fn_1363"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 3. I am discharging (vi<i>g</i>ârakŏ) my own <i>duty</i> as regards it <a name="fr_1369"></a><a href="#fn_1364"><font size="1">5</font></a>, where I so arrange affairs of every kind which <i>it</i> is possible for me to complete <i>for</i> a <i>period</i> of three months <a name="fr_1370"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>and</i> come myself to <i>where</i> you are, and that mastery (<i>k</i>îrîh) which is prepared is again arranged when it is wanted by them <a name="fr_1371"></a><a href="#fn_1366"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. You <i>have</i> already become a reserver (khamo-<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>âr) and rapid preparer of the adaptation of words in which cogency <i>exists</i>, and <i>have</i> clearly explained</p>

 <p>as much as is in sight about the reason of altering that decree, concerning which your opinion is written with great judiciousness. 5. But <i>as to</i> the understanding which prompted you to write properly, and not to alter the rites <i>and</i> purifications of the Avesta, and about the duty of purifying the purifiers <a name="fr_1372"></a><a href="#fn_1367"><font size="1">1</font></a>, such as <i>has</i> entered into the practice of the good, the propriety is declared in the teaching of the high-priests; <i>and</i> to do <i>it</i> better, so far as is possible, is to strive forwards in goodness.</p>  
 <p>6. Also, as regards changing the law of the fifteen times <i>washing</i> <a name="fr_1373"></a><a href="#fn_1368"><font size="1">2</font></a>, just as <i>it is</i> for Irân <i>in</i> which purifiers are to be found, it is ordered for <i>places</i> to be found without purifiers; <i>and it is</i> in the countries of Irân that the order is given regarding purifiers not thus appointed for the work.</p>
