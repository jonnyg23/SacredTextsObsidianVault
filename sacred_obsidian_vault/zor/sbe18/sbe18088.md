 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eightieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the purpose of this <i>ceremony for</i> the living soul <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> why <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">4</font></a> is it necessary</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>  
 <p>to order <i>it?</i> 2. And, whenever <i>one</i> orders it, how is it necessary then to order it, how is it best when they celebrate <i>it</i>, and what is its great advantage <i>as</i> a good work?</p>  
 <p>3. The reply is this, that worship with the ceremonial <i>for</i> those newly passed <i>away, during</i> the three days which <i>they spend</i> in the account <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is suitable for the discreet, just as the protection with nourishment of those newly born, in their infancy, is also much more suitable for the discreet. 4. He is a truly discreet man through whom <i>there</i> is ceremonial for the three <i>days</i>, on account of his own father, and privileged wife, and infant child, <i>and</i> well-behaved servant, on <i>their</i> passing away; and it is indispensable to order the triple ceremonial of the three days.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, is said: where it is not possible to solemnize his three <i>days</i>, or they solemnize <i>them</i> afterwards, when information <i>of the death</i> arrives <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">2</font></a>, three days are to be solemnized as a substitute <i>for</i> those three. 6. For the good work of the ceremonial which is ordered by him himself, or bequeathed by him, or is his <i>through</i> consenting to it by design <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">3</font></a>, exists--even though it is thus possible that it will be conducted afterwards--whenever it comes into progress; therefore he is exalted for it at his account</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the three <i>days</i>, and it comes on for his <i>being</i> exalted. 7. When that which is conducted afterwards comes on for aiding <i>his being</i> exalted in the three <i>days</i> of the account, that which <i>was</i> conducted by him himself beforehand is more hopeful <i>and</i> more certain of being exalted in that position.</p>  
 <p>8. On account of there being also a diminution (aîtŏ-<i>k</i> gahî<i>d</i>ârîh) of risk about their own souls, in the event of (min zak aîgh hat) their children not ordering the three <i>days' ceremonial</i>, or it not being possible to solemnize <i>it</i> at that time, it is desirable to order, in their own lifetime and <i>at</i> their own convenience, <i>the ceremony for</i> their own living souls, advisedly, without doubt, and <i>having</i> appointed the <i>mode of</i> life of the three <i>days</i>, and also to appoint by will him who is to conduct <i>it</i> in the end. 9. And when both are conducted, the increase of good works and exaltation, though the end is not possible, or is not proceeded <i>with</i>--and the previous good works are commendable, and, therefore, preservatory--<i>has</i> reached even unto the most lordly wishes.</p>  
 <p>10. <i>As to</i> the man <i>with</i> great <i>and</i> powerful children, to whom the ceremonial of the three <i>days</i> for himself <i>at</i> the final day, <i>and</i> also the progress of many good works <i>have</i> seemed certain, <i>but</i> on account of yet another way to freedom from doubt effectually (frârâstîhâ) existing, he <i>has</i> bequeathed the conduct of the three <i>days' ceremonial</i>, and also other good works, unto <i>his</i> children, in order that <i>the ceremony for</i> the living soul <i>may be</i> conducted <i>at</i> the final day, with him the angels are in triumph, the glory of the religion in the most lordly glory, <i>and</i> the solemnizers of ceremonial worship are many. 11. Then, moreover, owing to the contest of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p>demons--so unjust that <i>on</i> the day of his passing <i>away it</i> is due to the uncleanness (apâ<i>d</i>yâ<i>v</i>îh) which <i>has</i> attained unto <i>its full</i> extent <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">1</font></a>--all the solemnizers <i>in</i> the country, of the acts of worship solemnized, <i>may have</i> become thoroughly doubtful of the worship, and until it goes on to the disciples, and the ceremony is prepared, it is not proper to perform the whole ceremonial; in that way is manifested the great advantage <i>and</i> commendableness which <i>arises</i> from that ceremony <i>for</i> his living soul.</p>  
 <p>12. The nature of <i>the ceremony</i> ordered <i>for</i> the living soul is a counterpart of the three <i>days</i>, so <i>it</i> is needful that <i>at</i> all times of the three days <i>and</i> nights, successively emancipative (avadîgîni<i>s</i>nîk), a ceremonial <i>in honour</i> of Srôsh <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>be</i> always conducted, and <i>that</i> it proceed; and a fire is lighted in the ceremonial, and the clean ligature of the limbs is to be tied. 13. As a rule it is so considered that <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the three days <i>there</i> are fifteen <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">4</font></a> ceremonies (ya<i>s</i>tanŏ) <i>in honour</i> of Srôsh, and three sacred cakes (drôn) <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">5</font></a> which are consecrated in each dawn (bâm-<i>i</i>) with various dedications; and the fourth day they solemnize the Vispara<i>d</i> <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the portion <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">7</font></a> of the righteous guardian spirits (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>ŏ). 14. And there</p>

 <p>are fugitives of families of the period, <i>and</i> other still further diminishers <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">1</font></a> of good works, who <i>have</i> wished to produce the wealth which is necessary to perform advantageously, as a custom of the soul in those three days, one <i>celebration</i> of all the religious rites (hamâk dînô) <i>in honour</i> of Srôsh, <i>and</i> the consecration of three sacred cakes for Srôsh every day; and the third night, at dawn <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the consecration of a sacred cake <i>dedicated in</i> three modes. 15. In accomplishing the <i>consecration of the</i> sacred cake specially for the righteous guardian spirits, <i>on</i> the fourth day, <i>one</i> is supposed to order a Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>in honour</i> of the righteous guardian spirits, and the rest of the ceremonial.</p>  
 <p>16. And <i>he</i> who <i>has</i> intended much more laudably is declared <i>as</i> the more devout and more judicious of worshippers; and for the sake of the ceremonial he is cleansed by the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> is to practise other descriptions of cleanliness as regards <i>his</i> body and clothing. 17.

 <p>religion, wine from that made <i>by</i> those of the good religion, <i>and</i> meat from the animal <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is slaughtered in the ceremonial are eaten; <i>and one</i> is to proceed into the abode of fires <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">2</font></a> and of the good, <i>and</i> to abstain from the rest of the other places which are dubious <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>and</i> food which is dubious. 18. And with that thorough heedfulness <i>one</i> is to conduct and order that ceremonial in the abode of the ever-growing fire, or other fire of Varahrân <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">4</font></a>; whereby his numerous good works are effectual, <i>and</i> the path of good works <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">5</font></a> is very broad. 19. Concerning <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">6</font></a> the suffering of <i>him</i> whose capability in that which is his preserving efficacy <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">7</font></a> is less, it is thus revealed, that not he who is righteous is overwhelmed, as <i>it were</i> unwilling, by incapability <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">8</font></a>.</p>

XVII, 6).</p>
