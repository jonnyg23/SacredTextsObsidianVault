 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the fortieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: Of those whose decision is this, that it is not necessary to be steadfast in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers--by <i>which</i> decision this is asserted, <i>that</i> they should abandon the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers--<i>some one</i> disparages the religion <i>and</i> goes over to a foreign faith (an-aîrîh), then of what nature is his sin</p>  
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>  
 <p>owing thereto, <i>and</i> what does the sin owing thereto, as regards those of the same foreign religion, amount to? 2. Or order <i>some one</i> then to tell us clearly concerning it, how it is, and how is the disobedience due to this sin.</p>  
 <p>3. The reply is this, that an adult is worthy of death <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">1</font></a> on account of the good religion they <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">2</font></a> would abandon, on account also of the adopted law of the foreign faith <i>he</i> is worthy of death, in whose reliance upon the improper law is also the sin which they <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">3</font></a> maintain <i>and</i> practise by law, and through <i>being</i> in the same law <i>he</i> is equally sinful with them. 4. And also when any one is on that course, and his wish is <i>for</i> the same protection, of which a similitude is <i>in</i> the enduring words of that good law they would forsake, and he adopts that which is vile <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">4</font></a>, even through that impropriety <i>he</i> is equally sinful.</p>  
 <p>5. When he dies, without renunciation <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>of that sin</i> and impenitently, in that improperly-constituted law, the position of his soul is then in the worst</p>

 <p>existence <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and his punishment is that of many <i>sins</i> worthy of death; from the demons also <i>there</i> come grievously, hand in hand, pain and suffering, gnawing and stench of many kinds, stinging, tearing, and lacerating, primary evil and discomfort. 6. And through their <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">2</font></a> law and faith his distress in that worst existence is thus until the last change of existence, when the renovation <i>of the universe</i> is produced by will among living beings.</p>  
 <p>7. But reality (aîtŏîh), as regards living, arises from renunciation of that disobedience; it makes those attract to the good law who seduced him to that evil law, that which established him improperly in the law it eradicates from <i>his</i> conduct (rûbâkîh), advancing sins it again restrains, and whatever <i>has</i> advanced it repairs again anew through the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, <i>and</i> he becomes thoughtful, constant, and steadfast. 8. The sin which he set going he restrains and atones for by wealth, trouble, and authorising <a name="fr_513"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">3</font></a> commands; even in the body he also undergoes punishment in the three <i>nights</i> (satûîh) <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_512"><font size="1">4</font></a>; he then obtains forgiveness, and his soul is saved.</p>  
 <p>9. And as <i>it</i> is said in the persistent law of the sacred beings <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that 'the good religion of the sacred beings, who are the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping superiors,</p>

 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>ordains <i>it</i> as retribution,' so that the sin it takes away (spayêiti) <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">1</font></a> may not exist in him, his retribution is declared by revelation. 10. And by the same witness <i>it</i> is said, that all of the primitive faith have been quite of the same opinion about this, that from the good religion except by <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">2</font></a> the way of renunciation <i>of sin</i> there is none unless to hell; but that renunciation <i>should</i> be during life, for it is said that 'whoever <i>when</i> living does not become righteous, that is, does not fully atone for sin, <i>for</i> him <i>when</i> dead <i>there</i> is no grant of <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">3</font></a> the best existence.' 11. To commit no sin is better than retribution <i>and</i> renunciation of sin.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_507"></a><a href="sbe18048.htm#fr_509">137:4</a> The probable meaning is that if he conforms to the foreign faith merely from politic motives, while retaining a belief in his own religion, he is still equally sinful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_508"></a><a href="sbe18048.htm#fr_510">137:5</a> This renunciation is effected by the recitation of a particular formula called the Patit, in which every imaginable sin is mentioned with a declaration of repentance of any such sins as the reciter may have committed. But this formal renunciation must. be accompanied by atonement and true repentance; and in order to ascertain the proper atonement all serious sins must be confessed to the high-priest (see Sls. IV, 14, VIII, 1, 2, 8-10).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_509"></a><a href="sbe18048.htm#fr_511">138:1</a> See Chap. XXXIII, 3.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_511"></a><a href="sbe18048.htm#fr_513">138:3</a> Or, tûbânkâr, may mean 'lavish.' The ordering of religious ceremonies, as good works in atonement for sin, is probably in-tended; and these always imply a lavish expenditure upon the priesthood.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_512"></a><a href="sbe18048.htm#fr_514">138:4</a> Referring to the three nights' punishment after the resurrection of the body, which is specially reserved for mortal sinners (see Bd. XXX, 10).</p>
