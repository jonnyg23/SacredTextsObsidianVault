 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the fifty-sixth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: Who is suitable <i>for</i> adoption, <i>and</i> who is not suitable?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that a grown-up man of the good religion who is intelligent, a complete ruler of a numerous household <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">4</font></a>, expecting offspring, <i>and</i> not <i>having sins</i> worthy of death is suitable for adoption; even when he has accepted either one adoption, or many adoptions, he is then still suitable for another adoption. 3. And a grown-up woman, <i>or</i> even a child, is suitable for one adoption, <i>but</i> when adopted in one family she is not suitable for another adoption.</p>

 <p>4. A woman requiring a husband--though a complete worshipper--or a foreigner, or an infidel, or <i>one</i> having <i>sins</i> worthy of death, is unfit for adoption; so also those who are demon-worshippers, she who is a concubine (shûsar nê<i>s</i>man) <i>or</i> courtezan, <i>and</i> she who is menstruous are unfit.</p>
