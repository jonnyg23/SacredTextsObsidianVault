 <p>1. <i>It</i> <a name="fr_1329"></a><a href="#fn_1324"><font size="1">4</font></a> is both explained again <i>and</i> summarized <i>thus</i>:--If the decree be from a law of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is it so decreed as he spoke it? and if they should never perform by that, do not bring the Avesta <i>and its</i> exposition into the midst <i>of it</i>. 2. For the fifteen times <i>of</i> which you <i>have</i> written, if from the revelation of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, are his mode of <i>washing</i> fifteen times upwards and fifteen times downwards <a name="fr_1330"></a><a href="#fn_1325"><font size="1">5</font></a>, a rule</p>

 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>which is fulfilled. 3. <i>It</i> is said, if <i>one's defilement be</i> owing to depositing any bodily refuse (higar-1), then nothing of this is ever necessary for him, for one reckoning (mar-1) <a name="fr_1331"></a><a href="#fn_1326"><font size="1">1</font></a> will smite that which he takes hold of with a finger and <i>it</i> is clean, or it will smite a golden yellow clean, or whatever <a name="fr_1332"></a><a href="#fn_1327"><font size="1">2</font></a> it shall smite is clean; but nothing <i>merely</i> clean is purified, unless a demon be clean <a name="fr_1333"></a><a href="#fn_1328"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. And this, too, is very amazing to me, that when this is not taken into account by you, that when there should be, <i>and one</i> should obtain, no purifier <a name="fr_1334"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">4</font></a> it would then be necessary for him to operate himself <a name="fr_1335"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">5</font></a>, how then is this knowledge obtained by you, on which information (âgahîh) <i>has</i> reached you, that the purifying of all the purifiers of the country of Irân is just as they should always perform <i>it</i>. 5. When, as I consider, there is then no complete acquaintance <i>with</i> the management of a house in you, its own master, in what manner then is our account of the gossip <a name="fr_1336"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>and your</i> information, about all the purifiers of the country of Irân</p>  
 <p>

 <p>obtained? 6. If your <i>people</i> should abandon that <i>which is</i> most indispensable, and your account of the gossip, as regards that which the whole realm <i>has</i> done, <i>be</i> not according to the commands of religion and to sound wisdom; <i>and</i> if it has not come completely to your knowledge as the washing of the purifiers of the country of Irân--because, when you do not fix the number even of their footsteps <a name="fr_1337"></a><a href="#fn_1332"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>it</i> is certain that <i>your</i> understanding of their disposition <i>and</i> virtuous practice is even less--then it was necessary for you to determine the reason that all the purifiers in the country of Irân always wash that way that is declared as improper, with whatever certainty <i>it be</i> uttered <i>or</i> written.</p>
