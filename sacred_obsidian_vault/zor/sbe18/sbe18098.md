 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the ninetieth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: From what is the sky made, <i>and</i> with what is it prepared?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the sky is a dome (gardûn), wide <i>and</i> lofty; its inside and whole width and boundaries (âkhyakîhâ), besides its material existence, are the stone of light, of all stones the hardest <a name="fr_981"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>and</i> most beautiful; and the grandeur of its spirit <i>and</i> even <i>its</i> internal bow <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">2</font></a> are like <i>those of</i> mighty warriors arrayed. 3. And that material of the sky reached unto the place <i>where</i> promise-breaking words exist <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> was without need of preparation; <i>as</i> it is said <i>of</i> places such as those--where wisdom is a witness about <i>them</i>--that <i>that</i> which is not even itself a place, and its place does not yet exist, is without need of any preparing <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. The light is for existing things, and they cherish a faculty (nîyûîh) of motion also of two</p>

 <p>kinds, <i>that</i> causing motion <i>and that</i> of movables <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">1</font></a>; as mobility is mentioned about thought <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">2</font></a> and immobility about material things. 5. Immovables are not moved, while movables are moved by their power of movement; and those movables, that way causing motion, are afterwards themselves a moving secret cause of motion, and then a cause of motion is not moving the movable, since <i>it</i> is not incapable of causing motion secretly by movement of itself. 6. Just as the force (kûni<i>s</i>nŏ) of a movement exists <i>and</i> does not become a force; only then it is declared by wisdom, that the causers of motion have been the causing of motion by force before movement, <i>and, being</i> unmoved, they are subsequently made to move by the force; later on, the causers of motion <i>have</i> to cause motion, by their power of causing motion, <i>in</i> the non-causers of motion, from which it is certain though the force of a movement exists it does not become a force; but, finally, that <i>which is</i> prepared with a source of activity <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">3</font></a>, before force, becomes unmoved.</p>  
 <p>7. Natures without need of the trouble of a preparer are distinguished from such; where movement occurs through every force, the championship of a position (gâh) not made to move--except, indeed, <i>of that</i> whose force, when it is unmoved by other force, is its own--is unmoving and thirstless <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 8. <i>It</i> </p>

 <p><i>was</i> restored immovably when <i>there was</i> an approach to the sky of that actual contender for the place, the fiend, and the sky <i>was</i> shaken by him; for connected with the sky <i>were</i> arranged so many possessors of all resources, dignified (afrankî<i>d</i>) by their. own all-powerful position and that well-operating, mighty, undrawn bow <a name="fr_989"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">1</font></a>, righteous <i>and</i> well-discoursing (hûfravakhsh), and many good spirits, gloriously co-operating for the preparation of the sky. 9. For that which <i>was</i> not even itself a place <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">2</font></a>, when <i>it</i> is thus henceforth really a place, is <i>in</i> want of preparing; <i>and</i>, in the preparation <i>of</i> that visible <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">3</font></a> place, with the material of the sky is mingled that triumphing, powerful spirit who made its existence a seeking for principle <i>and</i> seeking for intention, drawing up from below <i>and</i> drawing down from above, so that through that seeking for principle it becomes a concord, the resting-place of united champions, and unadmonishable through that power of seeking for intention; such as this <i>it is</i> if, indeed, <i>it be</i> the will of him, the creator of all goodness.</p>  
 <p>10. And it is said summarily that the sky was shaken in the <i>period of</i> disturbance and restored <i>with</i> trouble; and, if the guardian spirits are in freedom from disturbance through the glory <i>of</i> the creator, when there is not even a place for it prepared by themselves <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and <i>their</i> nature and own</p>

 <p><a name="fn_978"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_981">259:1</a> The same notion as that indicated in Genesis by the word 'firmament.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_980"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_983">259:3</a> Probably meaning that the sky extends downwards, below the horizon, as far as the second grade of hell, that for 'evil words,' Du<i>s</i>-hûkht (see Sls. VI, 3, note).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_981"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_984">259:4</a> The word dîvâk, 'place' (zîvâk in the Sasanian inscription of Naq<i>s</i>-i Rustam, but traditionally pronounced <i>g</i>înâk), seems to be here taken in the etymological sense of zîvâk, that is, 'a living-place.' The text refers to the period, in the beginning, when the sky was indefinite space unprepared for the residence of creatures and merely a region of light (see Bd. I, 2), the light mentioned in § 4. Its preparation is referred to in §§ 8, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_982"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_985">260:1</a> M14 has 'movables <i>and</i> immovables' instead of this clause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_983"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_986">260:2</a> Perhaps we should read 'the spirits,' by inserting an additional medial stroke in the Pahlavi word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_984"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_987">260:3</a> Reading tûkhshînîkîhâ, instead of the unintelligible tûkhshtîkîhâ'. The author has so nearly lost sight of his argument in the mazes of his verbiage that there is some uncertainty about the translation of this paragraph.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_985"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_988">260:4</a> That is, the guardians of a place exposed to all attacks (as <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a> the sky is supposed to be), unless it is a stronghold in itself, must be always on the alert.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_986"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_989">261:1</a> The rainbow; reading atan<i>g</i> darûn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_987"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_990">261:2</a> That is, 'a living-place' (see § 3 n).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_988"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_991">261:3</a> Reading dî<i>d</i>ŏ, 'seen;' but it may be stô for stî, 'material.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_989"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_992">261:4</a> That is, while the sky was still indefinite space, the region of light, but, no dwelling-place; although the guardian spirits had <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a> been created as representatives of the creatures, both spiritual and material, which were to be afterwards produced (see Bd. I, 8).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_990"></a><a href="sbe18098.htm#fr_993">262:1</a> That is, when afterwards prepared as a dwelling-place the sky remains unmoved by evil beings.</p>
