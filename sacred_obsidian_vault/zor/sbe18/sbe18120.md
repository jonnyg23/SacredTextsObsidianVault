 <p>1. To arrange again for approval the other <i>matters, of</i> which a portion is written <i>about</i> by you, an epistle <a name="fr_1374"></a><a href="#fn_1369"><font size="1">3</font></a> is again prepared in advance for Sîrkân, Shirâ<i>z</i>, <i>and</i> other <i>places</i>, so as thus to make your decree a writing of bygone offence. 2. Because, if your despatch (firîst) prepared this new .proceeding, and you do not turn away <i>from</i> it, <i>and</i> do not recede through opposition <i>and</i> accumulation of vexation, <i>and</i> these others, too, like thee, shall</p>

And <i>I</i> myself <i>shall have</i> to retire (agvira<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ) from the countries of Irân, <i>and</i> to wander forth to far distant realms where I <i>shall</i> not hear a rumour about your evil deeds. 5. In <i>my</i> occupation, moreover, my fortune (sukûn) <i>may be</i> to wander forth by water even to China, or by land even to Arûm <a name="fr_1375"></a><a href="#fn_1370"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but <i>to be</i> carried off by Vâê <a name="fr_1376"></a><a href="#fn_1371"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that uplifter, is much more my desire than when I am there where, owing to you, I hear that, as regards the glorifying of the sacred beings, which, because of my reply obtained above, <i>would</i> then <i>be</i> as much as death to me; <i>it would</i> also be the ending of that internal strife, <i>so</i> distasteful (aparvârakŏ) to me, which is like <i>his</i> who <i>has</i> to struggle with his own life.</p>
