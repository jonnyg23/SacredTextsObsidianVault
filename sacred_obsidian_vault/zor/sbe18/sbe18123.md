 <p>THE Avesta informs us that Keresâspa was a son of Thrita the Sâman, and the brother of Urvâkhshaya <a name="fr_1417"></a><a href="#fn_1412"><font size="1">1</font></a>. From the name of his father's family he is sometimes called Sâma Keresâspa <a name="fr_1418"></a><a href="#fn_1413"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but his more usual title is Nareman<i>a</i>u or Nairiman<i>a</i>u, 'the manly-minded <a name="fr_1419"></a><a href="#fn_1414"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' He is described as 'a youthful hero, wearing side-locks and carrying a club <a name="fr_1420"></a><a href="#fn_1415"><font size="1">4</font></a>,' to whom the witch Knãthaiti <a name="fr_1421"></a><a href="#fn_1416"><font size="1">5</font></a> attached herself; she whom Zaratû<i>s</i>t promised to destroy by means of the apostle Saoshyãs, who is to be born hereafter <a name="fr_1422"></a><a href="#fn_1417"><font size="1">6</font></a>. And his body is watched over by 99,999 guardian spirits <a name="fr_1423"></a><a href="#fn_1418"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>

 <p>Of his exploits we are told that he 'slew the serpent Srvara, which devoured horses and men, which was poisonous and yellow, over which yellow poison flowed a hand's-breadth high. On which Keresâspa cooked a beverage in a caldron at the midday hour, and the serpent being scorched, hissed, sprang forth, away from the caldron, and upset the boiling water; Keresâsp, the manly-minded, fled aside frightened <a name="fr_1424"></a><a href="#fn_1419"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' We are further told that he slew the golden-heeled Ga<i>n</i>darewa <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1420"><font size="1">2</font></a>; that he smote Hitâspa in revenge for the murder of his brother, Urvâkhshaya <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1421"><font size="1">3</font></a>; that he smote the Hunus who are the nine highwaymen, and those descended from Nivika and Dâ<i>s</i>tayâni <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1422"><font size="1">4</font></a>; also Vareshava the Dânayan, Pitaona with the many witches, Arezô-shamana, and Snâvidhaka <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1423"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and that he withstood many smiters or murderers <a name="fr_1429"></a><a href="#fn_1424"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>The details of these exploits, still extant in the Avesta, are very scanty; but some of them appear to have been more fully described in a legend about the soul of Keresâspa which formerly constituted the fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask, the contents of which are thus summarized in the ninth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>:--</p>

The Pahlavi legend is included among a series of quotations, regarding the importance of fire, contained in a Pahlavi Rivâyat preceding the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk in some manuscripts <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and its close correspondence with the' above summary of the fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask will be seen from the following translation of it:--</p>  
 <p>. . . . 'And <i>it</i> is declared that fire is so precious that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: "Of whose soul is it <i>that</i> the actions' <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">3</font></a>, position, consciousness, and guardian spirit seem best when thou shalt behold <i>it</i>?"</p>  
 <p>'And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: "Of him who is Keresâsp."</p>  
 <p>'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> summoned the soul of Keresâsp, and the soul of Keresâsp saw <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">4</font></a> Zaratû<i>s</i>t and, on account of the misery which it had seen in hell, it spoke unto <i>him</i> thus: "I have been a priest of Kâpûl <a name="fr_1444"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">5</font></a>, which should be a power in support of me; and for the sake of begging life I have ever travelled through the world, and the world would have become hideous in my eyes, the world which should have feared my splendour <a name="fr_1445"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">6</font></a>."</p>

 <p>And the soul of Keresâsp spoke thus: "Forgive me, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! and grant me the best existence! grant me the supreme heaven!

And the wind, when those words <i>were</i> heard by it, came on so strongly that every tree and shrub which was in its path <i>was</i> uprooted, and the whole earth which was in its path <i>was</i> reduced to powder (payan<i>g</i>ânŏîaîtŏ ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ), and darkness arose. And when it came to me, who am Keresâsp, it was not possible for it to lift my foot from the ground; and I arose and sallied forth (ba<i>r</i>â yehabûn<i>d</i>) upon the earth, and I stood <i>upon</i> it, with both feet on an equality (mirîh), until a rampart (pû<i>s</i>tŏ) of it <i>was</i> completed, so that I <i>might</i> go again below the earth; that which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> ordered thus: 'Should I appoint a keeper of the earth and sky, they would not forsake me <a name="fr_1460"></a><a href="#fn_1455"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'

Whether these words were used merely as names, or whether their insertion implies that the fargar<i>d</i>s of these Nasks used to be recited (somewhat like those of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>) alternately with the sections of the Gâthas, can hardly be determined from our present information. It may be noted that the three Nasks (Sû<i>d</i>kar, Var<i>s</i>tmânsar, and Bakô), whose contents are thus detailed in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, all belong to the so-called gâsânîk or Gâtha class of Nasks; but whether that term implies that they were metrical, or merely that they were connected in some way with the Gâthas, is also uncertain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1461"></a><a href="sbe18123.htm#fr_1466">379:3</a> The Persian version of this speech is, 'O good creator!

 <p><a name="fn_1463"></a><a href="sbe18123.htm#fr_1468">379:5</a> The Persian version proceeds, and concludes the sentence, as follows: 'and Keresâsp groaned unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, and Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, said: "'O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! thou dost not know what Keresâsp has done unto me; that in the world, formerly, my custom and habit would have been so, that, as they would place firewood under a caldron, I would send the fire, until that caldron should be boiled, and their work should be completed, <i>and</i> then it would have come back to its own place. As that serpent that he speaks of <i>was</i> slain he became hungry, and because the fire fell one moment later upon the firewood which he had placed below the caldron, he smote the fire <i>with</i> a club and scattered the fire, <i>and</i> now I <i>will</i> not pass the soul of Keresâsp to heaven."'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1465"></a><a href="sbe18123.htm#fr_1470">380:2</a> The Persian version omits these words, and the preceding paragraph, proceeding in continuation of note 5, p. 379, as follows: 'And as Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, spoke these words, the soul of Keresâsp wept and said: "Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, speaks truly; I committed sin and I repent." And he touched the skirt of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>with his</i> hand, and said: "Of mankind no one has obtained the eminence, rank, and dignity that thou obtainedst; now, through this grandeur and glory which is thine, do thou entreat and make intercession of Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, for me! so that it may be that I obtain liberation from this distress and torment."'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1468"></a><a href="sbe18123.htm#fr_1473">380:5</a> The Persian version continues as follows: 'And as Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân made intercession, Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, said: "Thy reputation is immense, and thy will is great." And after that he made no opposition to the soul of Keresâsp, but pardoned <i>it</i> for Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân; and the soul of Keresâsp obtained liberation from that discomfort.' This version then concludes with an admonition as to the necessity of treating fire with proper respect.</p>
