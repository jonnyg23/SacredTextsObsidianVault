 <p>1. For in the third fargar<i>d</i> ('chapter) of the Vendidad of Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1237"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>it</i> is declared that when life is resigned without effort <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">2</font></a>, at the time when the life departs, when a dog is tied to his foot, even then the Nasû<i>s</i> <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">3</font></a> rushes upon it, and afterwards, when seen by it, the Nasû<i>s</i> is destroyed by it. 2. This is where <i>it is stated</i> which is the dog which destroys the Nasû<i>s</i> <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the shepherd's dog, the village-dog, the blood-hound, the slender hound <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and the rûkûnîk <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">6</font></a>;</p>

 <p>and as to the rûkûnîk there have been divers opinions, <i>as</i> Vand-Aûharmazd <a name="fr_1250"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">1</font></a> asserted, from the teaching of Afarg, that it does not destroy <i>it</i>. 3. The dog destroys the Nasû<i>s</i> at the time when it sees the flesh, and when it sees the hair or nails it does not destroy <i>it</i> <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 4. A blind dog also destroys <i>it</i> at the time when it places a paw <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">3</font></a> on the corpse; and when it places <i>it</i> upon the hair or nails it does not destroy <i>it</i> <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5. The birds which destroy the Nasû<i>s</i> are three: the mountain kite, the black crow, and the vulture <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">5</font></a>; the bird, moreover, destroys <i>it</i> at the time when <i>its</i> shadow falls upon it; when it sees it in the water, a mirror, or a looking-glass, it does not destroy <i>it</i> <a name="fr_1255"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>

 <p>6. Vand-Aûharmazd said, where a pregnant woman is to be carried by two men <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">1</font></a>, both are to be cleansed by the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the head of the corpse, when they carry it away, is to be set towards the Dakhma <a name="fr_1258"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 7. And on account of contamination</p>

Every one who understands the care of a corpse is proper; two boys of eight years old, who understand the care, are proper; a woman free from menstruation, or free from dead</p>

 <p>9. It is not to be carried all covered up <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1255"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for <i>that</i> is burying the corpse; to carry <i>it</i> in the rain is worthy of death <a name="fr_1263"></a><a href="#fn_1256"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 10. When clouds have been around <a name="fr_1264"></a><a href="#fn_1257"><font size="1">4</font></a>, it is allowable to carry <i>it</i> away from the house; and when rain sets in upon the road it is not allowable to carry <i>it</i> back to the house; <i>but</i> when it is before a veranda (dâhlî<i>z</i>) <i>one</i> should put <i>it</i> down there; that is allowable when he who owns the veranda is apprehensive, <i>and</i> when he does not allow <i>it</i> inside; and, afterwards, it is to be carried away to its place, and when the water stands the height of a javelin (nî<i>z</i>ak) inside <a name="fr_1265"></a><a href="#fn_1258"><font size="1">5</font></a>, <i>one</i> puts <i>it</i> down <i>and</i> brings <i>it</i> away yet again. 11. Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh <a name="fr_1266"></a><a href="#fn_1259"><font size="1">6</font></a> says that there should be a shelter (var) <a name="fr_1267"></a><a href="#fn_1260"><font size="1">7</font></a> <i>one</i> should</p>

 <p>fasten above that place, <i>and</i> it would make <i>it</i> dry below <a name="fr_1268"></a><a href="#fn_1261"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>one</i> should place the corpse under that shelter, and they may take the shelter <i>and</i> bring <i>it</i> away.</p>  
 <p>12. From the fifth fargar<i>d</i> of the Vendidad of Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh <a name="fr_1269"></a><a href="#fn_1262"><font size="1">2</font></a> they state thus, that at the place where one's life goes forth, when he shall die upon a cloth, and a hair or a limb remains upon the bed-place and the ground <a name="fr_1270"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the ground conveys the pollution, even not originating with <i>itself</i> (ahambûni<i>k</i>), in like manner down unto the water <a name="fr_1271"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 13. And when <i>he is</i> on a bedstead, and <i>its</i> legs are not connected with the ground, when a hair or a limb remains behind on the bedstead, it does not convey <i>the pollution</i> down. 14. When he shall die on a plastered floor the plaster is polluted, and when they dig up that plaster, and spread <i>it</i> again afterwards, it is clean. 15. When he shall die on a stone, and the stone is connected with the ground, the stone will become clean, <i>along</i> with the ground, in the length of a year; and when they dig up the place, the stone <i>being</i> polluted is to be washed at the time. 16. When a stone is connected with the ground, or is separated, and <i>one</i> shall die upon it, so much space of the stone as the corpse occupied is polluted  <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">5</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>when they shall leave it, in the length of a year it will become clean <i>along</i> with the ground; and when they dig <i>it</i> up, the stone is all polluted, <i>and</i> is to be washed at the time; when the stone is not made <i>even</i> with the ground, above the ground the stone is all polluted, <i>and</i> is to be washed at the time.</p>  
 <p>17. Dung-fuel <i>and</i> ashes, when the limbs of a menstruous woman come upon them, are both polluted; and the salt and lime for washing <i>her</i> shift (kartak-shûî) are <i>to be treated</i> just like stone <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>18. If <i>one</i> shall die on a terrace roof (bân) <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">2</font></a>, when one of his limbs, or a hair, remains behind at the edge of the roof, the roof is polluted <i>for</i> the size of the body as far as the water; and they should carry down all the <i>sacred</i> twigs (baresôm) <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1268"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the house, from the place where the pollution is, until there are thirty steps of three feet <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1269"><font size="1">4</font></a> to the <i>sacred</i> twigs, so that the <i>sacred</i> twigs may not be polluted; and when his hair or limb has not come to the eaves (parakân) the roof is polluted to the bottom (tôhîk). 19. And when <i>one</i> shall die on a rîtâ <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1270"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>it</i> is polluted</p>

 <p><i>for</i> the size of the body as far as the water; <i>in</i> the length of a year it will become clean <i>along</i> with the ground. 20. A built bridge is <i>liable</i> just like a terrace roof. 21. When <i>one</i> shall die on the terrace roof of a trellised <i>apartment</i> (varam), that is also <i>liable</i> just like a terrace roof. 22. When he shall die in a trellised <i>apartment</i>, when one of his limbs, or a hair, does not remain on the borders (parakân), it does not convey the pollution down, but when <i>any</i> of him remains behind it conveys <i>it</i> down; it is allowable when they dig <i>it</i> up <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and <i>one</i> also spreads <i>it</i> again afterwards, and <i>it</i> is clean.</p>  
 <p>23. When <i>one</i> shall die by strangulation and a rope in a crowd, when <i>there</i> is no fear of his falling down they should not carry <i>him</i> down; and when <i>there</i> is a fear of his falling down, when that fear is as regards one side of him, they should carry <i>him</i> down on that side; and when <i>he has</i> fallen down they should carry <i>him</i> down <i>in</i> such <i>place</i> as <i>he has</i> fallen. 24. When <i>one</i> is seated upright <i>and</i> shall die, when <i>there</i> is fear of his falling on one side they should carry <i>him</i> down <i>on</i> that one side, and when there is fear on all four sides, <i>then</i> on all four sides; and when <i>he has</i> fallen down they should carry <i>him</i> down in such place as <i>he has</i> fallen <a name="fr_1279"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>25. And when <i>one</i> shall die on a tree, when its</p>

 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>bark is green and <i>there</i> is no fear of falling off, they should not carry <i>him</i> down; and when <i>there</i> is fear of it, they should carry down the whole of the body (tanû masâî). 26. And when the bark of the tree is withered, when <i>there</i> is fear of it and when <i>there</i> is no fear of it, they should carry <i>it</i> down. 27. When he shall die on a branch of a tree which is green, when <i>there</i> is no fear of his falling off they should not carry <i>him</i> down. 28. And when <i>there</i> is fear of it, or <i>it is</i> a branch of a withered tree, when also, a hair originating with him, or a limb, remains behind on the particular tree, they should carry down the whole of the body <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 29. And when it does not remain behind him on the particular tree, but when <i>there</i> is fear of its falling off, they should not carry it below (vad frô<i>d</i>) <a name="fr_1281"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>30. When a corpse (nasâî-1) <a name="fr_1282"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">3</font></a>, from outside of it, remains behind on a jar (khûmbŏ) in which <i>there</i> may be wine, the jar is polluted, <i>and</i> the wine is clean. 31. And when <i>one</i> shall die inside, in the wine in the jar, if not even a hair or a curl originating with him remains behind on the jar, the wine is polluted and the jar not polluted <a name="fr_1283"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 32. When <i>it is</i></p>

 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p>a jar in which <i>there</i> is oil <a name="fr_1284"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and dead matter (nasâî), from outside of it, remains behind on it, this is even <i>as</i> though it remains inside it, because the oil comes outside and goes back to the inside, <i>and</i> both are polluted, the jar and the oil; and even on making the jar dry <a name="fr_1285"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">2</font></a> it is not fit to put anything in.</p>  
 <p>33. When a serpent (gar<i>z</i>ak) is in a jar in which <i>there</i> is wine, both are useless and polluted, for it makes <i>them</i> contaminated (pa<i>d</i>vîshak). 34. And when corn shall be in <i>it</i>, the jar is polluted and the corn clean; and when nothing originating with <i>the serpent</i> inside the jar remains behind on the jar, so much of the corn as includes the serpent, and upon <i>which</i> the touch (mâli<i>s</i>n) of the serpent has gonebecause the touch of the serpent's seed might be the death of oneis to be taken out <i>and</i> to be thrown away. 35. And when hair or dead matter, even not originating with <i>the serpent</i>, remains behind on the jar, the jar is polluted, but is serviceable (shâya<i>d</i>) on making <i>it</i> dry <a name="fr_1286"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>36. Brick, earth, and mortar are separated by</p>

 <p>their own substance (pavan mindavam-i naf<i>s</i>man), and are connected with the ground; being separated by their own substance is this, that so much space as dead matter <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">1</font></a> comes upon is polluted; being connected with the ground is this, that they would convey the pollution down unto the water. 37. Dung-fuel, ashes, flour, and other powdered things are connected with their own substance, and are separated from the ground; being connected with their own substance is this, that when dead matter comes upon them the whole of them is polluted; and being separated from the ground is this, that when dead matter comes upon them it does not make the ground polluted <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1281"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>38. <i>At</i> a house <i>in</i> which the <i>sacred</i> ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) is prepared, and a dog or a person passes <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1282"><font size="1">3</font></a> away in it, the first business to be done is this, that the fire is to be preserved from harm; moreover, if it be only possible to carry the fire so that they would carry <i>it</i> away within three steps of the corpse <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1283"><font size="1">4</font></a>, even then it is to be carried away, <i>and</i> the</p>

 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>wall is not to be cut. 39. Rôshan <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1284"><font size="1">1</font></a> said that an earthen <i>one</i> is to be cut into, <i>but</i> a mortar <i>one</i> is not to be cut; below and above no account <i>is taken</i> of damaging (bo<i>d</i>ôzê<i>d</i>îh) <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1285"><font size="1">2</font></a> the wall <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 40. To bring the fire within <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">4</font></a> the three steps from the corpse is a Tanâpûhar sin; and when exudation happens to the corpse, it is worthy of death <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1288"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 41. The prepared food in that house is all useless, and that which is not prepared is usable in the length of nine nights</p>

 <p><i>or</i> a month <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1289"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 42. Clothing also <i>in</i> like manner, except that which <i>one</i> wears on the body; that, even in that time, is not clean, since it remains in use. 43. And the holy-water (zôhar) <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">2</font></a>, too, which is taken and remains <i>in</i> that place, is to be carried away immediately to the water; also the sacred milk (<i>g</i>îv) <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>and</i> butter (<i>g</i>um) <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>in</i> like manner. 44. Of the prayer <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">5</font></a> clothing Vand-Aûharmazd <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">6</font></a> said that it is usable in the length of nine nights <i>or</i> a month, the writer <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">7</font></a> (dapîr) said that it is when they perform the washing of hands, and wash <i>it</i> thoroughly, it will become clean at the time.</p>  
 <p>45. If in a house there are three rooms (gun<i>g</i>înak), and <i>one</i> shall die in the entrance place (dargâs), if <i>it be</i> so that they may set the door open, and the corpse comes to this side, only this</p>

 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>side is polluted; and if the corpse comes to that side, only that side is polluted; when it comes to both sides at once (aêvâ<i>k</i>), only the entrance place is polluted alone, both the dwelling-rooms (khânak) are clean.</p>  
 <p>46. And the vault of the sacred fires <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">1</font></a> alone does not become polluted.</p>  
 <p>47. If <i>one</i> shall die in a wild spot (va<i>s</i>kar), prepared food which is within three steps is all useless, and beyond four steps it is not polluted. 48. Prepared food is this, such as bread, boiled and roast meat, and prepared broth <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>49. And the ashes (var) of the sacred fire <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">3</font></a> become in a measure polluted.</p>  
 <p>50. Should they carry in the fire into that house in which the length of nine nights <i>or</i> a month is requisite for becoming clean, <i>there</i> is a sin of one Tanâpûhar <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">4</font></a> through carrying <i>it</i> in, and one Tanâpûhar through kindling <i>it</i>; and every trifling <i>creature</i> (khûr or khûl) which shall die and shall remain <i>causes</i> a sin of one Tanâpûhar. 51. Also through carrying water in, <i>there</i> is a sin of one Farmân; and to pour water on the place where <i>any</i> one's life departs is a sin of one Tanâpûhar, and to pour <i>it</i> on a different place is a sin of one Yât. 52. And to</p>

 <p>undergo ablution <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">1</font></a> inside <i>the unclean house</i> is all non-ablution. 53. And whoever goes into it needlessly, <i>his</i> body <i>and</i> clothes are to be every time thoroughly washed, and his sin is one Tanâpûhar <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and when he goes in needfully <i>it</i> is neither good work nor sin <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>54. And this pollution is all in the sharp account (tîkhak amâr) when the life departs <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">3</font></a>; the only <i>thing</i> which amounts to polluting is contact with the flesh, and even with the hair and nails. 55. Of the contact which is stated in the Avesta <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the account is <i>that it is</i> from one side, and it ever cleaves to <i>one</i>; the curse (ga<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">5</font></a> which is stated in the Avesta advances from all four sides. 56. Sôshyans <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">6</font></a> said it is, until its exhibition to a dog, just as it becomes at the time when its life departs <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">7</font></a>; a priest, a</p>

Kûshtanŏ-bû<i>g</i>ê<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">1</font></a> said the account is at the time when its life departs; and that which Kûshtanŏ-bû<i>g</i>ê<i>d</i> specially said is, 'when anything is inside it (the place) the pollution is as far as to the place where that thing stands.' 58.

Direct pollution (hamrê<i>d</i>) <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">4</font></a> is that when the body is in contact with a corpse, and indirect pollution (paîtrê<i>d</i>)</p>

The indirect pollution of an ape <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">3</font></a> and a menstruous woman, not acting the same <i>way</i>, remains. 62.

 <p>73. Of a flock in which is a sheep by whom dead matter is eaten, of a forest in which is a tree with which dead matter is mingled, and of a firewood-stand (aesamdân) in which is a stick of firewood with which grease is mingled, Afarg said that it is not proper to make the flock and the forest fruitful, and the firewood is useless <a name="fr_1337"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>74. <i>About</i> a door on which a corpse impinges; as to the door of a town and city they have been of the same opinion, that <i>it</i> is to be discarded by <i>his</i> comrades (hamkâr) <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">3</font></a>; as to a door which is mostly closed (badtûm) <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">4</font></a> they have been of different opinions,</p>

The door of one's own chief apartment (shah-gâs) is fit for that of the place for menstruation (da<i>s</i>tânistân), and that of the place for menstruation is fit for that of the depository <i>for the dead</i> (khazânŏ) <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and that of the depository of the dead is not fit for any purpose whatever <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">3</font></a>; that of the more pleasant is fit for that of the more grievous.</p>  
 <p>76. Any one who, through sinfulness, throws a corpse into the water, is worthy of death on the spot <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">4</font></a>; when he throws only one <i>it is</i> one <i>sin</i> worthy of death, <i>and</i> when he throws ten at one time <i>it is</i> then one <i>sin</i> worthy of death; when he throws <i>them</i> separately <i>it is</i> a <i>sin</i> worthy of death for each one. 77. Of the water, into which <i>one</i> throws dead matter, the extent of pollution is three steps of three feet <i>in</i> the water advancing, nine steps of three feet <i>in</i> the water <i>passed</i> over, and six steps of three feet <i>in</i> the water alongside <a name="fr_1344"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">5</font></a>; six steps of three feet in the depth of the water, and three steps of three feet in the water pouring over the dead matter are polluted as regards the depth <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1337"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 78.

Sôshyans <a name="fr_1348"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">3</font></a> said that, when it is an injury, it is allowable when <a name="fr_1349"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">4</font></a> he does not bring <i>it</i> out; and when it is not an injury, and he does not bring <i>it</i>, his sin is a Tanâpûhar <a name="fr_1350"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 81.

 <p>polluted, and whatever <i>he</i> is first able <i>and</i> best able <i>to bring</i> is to be brought out by him. 84. When, too, he is able to bring <i>it</i> out through the breadth of the water, then also it is to be brought out so <a name="fr_1354"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and when he is not able, it is to be brought out through the length of the water; and showing <i>it to</i> a dog <i>and</i> the two men are not to be waited for <a name="fr_1355"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>85. And it is to be carried by him so much away from the neighbourhood of the water that, when he puts <i>it</i> down, the water which comes out dropping from the corpse does not reach back to the water; for when the water which comes out from the corpse reaches continuously back to the water <i>he</i> is worthy of death; and after that (min zak frâ<i>g</i>) it is to be shown <i>to</i> a dog, and it is to be carried away by two men. 86. And when he wishes to throw <i>it</i> out from the water, Mar<i>d</i>-bû<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1356"></a><a href="#fn_1348"><font size="1">3</font></a> said it is allowable to throw <i>it</i> out thus, so that the water of the dripping corpse does not reach continuously back to the water; Rôshan said it would be allowable to throw <i>it</i> out far.</p>  
 <p>87. To drag <i>it</i> over the water is allowable, to grasp and relinquish <i>it</i> is not allowable <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1349"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and when it is possible to act so that he may convey <i>it</i> from a great water to a small water, when the water is</p>

Afarg <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1350"><font size="1">1</font></a> said it is allowable to drag <i>it</i> below through the water, but to drag <i>it</i> over is not allowable, for this has come <i>on</i> the water <i>as</i> a danger <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1351"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and that has not come on <i>it as</i> a danger. 89. Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh <a name="fr_1360"></a><a href="#fn_1350"><font size="1">1</font></a> said it is allowable to drag <i>it</i> above, <i>but</i> to drag <i>it</i> below is not allowable, for the danger has gone out across the water, and the danger is not now to be brought upon it; and on that which is below, <i>on</i> which the danger has not come, the danger will at last arrive.</p>  
 <p>90. When he goes into the water he is to go into it with this idea, that 'should there be many below, then I will even bring all;' for whoever goes in not with this idea, and shall disturb any other one which lies there, will become polluted <a name="fr_1361"></a><a href="#fn_1352"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 91. And if the corpse be heavy <i>and</i> it is not possible to bring <i>it</i> out by one person; <i>and</i> he goes out with this idea, that 'I <i>will</i> go and prepare means, and bring this corpse out of the water;' and when through sinfulness <a name="fr_1362"></a><a href="#fn_1353"><font size="1">4</font></a> he does not go back his body is polluted <i>and</i> worthy of</p>

 <p>92. When the corpse is so decomposed (pû<i>d</i>ak), when <i>it</i> is thus necessary to bring it out, that, he must cut off various fragments, even after he cuts <i>them</i> off <i>they</i> are to be brought out; and for every fragment his hands and knife are to be washed with bull's urine (gômê<i>z</i>), and with dust and moisture (nambŏ) <i>they</i> are clean <a name="fr_1363"></a><a href="#fn_1354"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 93. And <i>they</i> are to be torn off <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1355"><font size="1">2</font></a> by him, and for every single fragment which he brings out his good work is one Tanâpûhar.</p>  
 <p>94. And when rain is falling the corpse lies in the water; to take <i>it</i> from the water to deposit <i>it</i> in the rain is not <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1356"><font size="1">3</font></a> allowable.</p>  
 <p>95. Clothing which is useless <a name="fr_1366"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">4</font></a>, this is that in which they should carry a corpse, and that even when very much <i>or</i> altogether useless; of that on which they shall decompose <a name="fr_1367"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">5</font></a> (barâ vishûpênd), and of that on which the excretions (hîkhar) of the dead come, so much space is to be cut away <a name="fr_1368"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and the rest is to be</p>

When <i>one</i> shall die upon a rich carpet (bûp) when the carpet is on a coarse rug (nama<i>d</i>) <i>and</i> is made connected, the rug and carpet are both polluted, and when separated the rug is clean. 102. When several cushions are heaped (ni<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>) one upon the other, and are not made connected, and dead matter comes upon them, they have been unanimous that only that one is polluted on which the dead matter came. 103.

Of several cushions which are tied down together, when dead matter comes to the tie, both are polluted, the cord <i>and</i> the cushions; and when the dead matter comes to a cushion, and does not come to the tie, the cushions are all polluted on account of the connection, and the tie is clean <a name="fr_1379"></a><a href="#fn_1370"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>

VIII, 38-48). The carcase of a dog is considered equally contagious with the corpse of a human being, and when the fiend of corruption (Nasû<i>s</i> or Nas of Bund. XXVIII, 29) has seized upon any one, it can be driven out only by a long and troublesome form of purification described in Vend. VIII. 111-228, IX, 4-117.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1240"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1247">245:4</a> This statement is now to be found in Pahl. Vend. VII, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1241"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1248">245:5</a> See Bund. XIV, 19. The Persian Rivâyats of Kâmah Bahrah and Kâûs Kâmân (quoted in B29) describe these dogs as 'the shepherd's dog, the house-dog, the strange or tame (gharîb) dog, and the puppy.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1242"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1249">245:6</a> Probably the Av. sukuruna of Vend. V, 100, XIII, 48, which <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a> is translated by hûkar or hûkûr in the Pahlavi version. This fifth kind of dog is called 'the blind (kûr) dog' in the Persian Rivâyats; but Pahl. Vend. VII, 4 asserts that, 'Sôshâns said the rûkunîk also destroys it,' and then speaks of the blind dog as in § 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1243"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1250">246:1</a> See the note on Chap. I, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1244"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1251">246:2</a> This is also stated in Pahl. Vend. III, 138.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1245"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1252">246:3</a> See Pahl. Vend. VII, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1246"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1253">246:4</a> The Persian Rivâyats say this is because the Nasû<i>s</i> is concealed beneath the hair and nails (compare Vend. VII, 70).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1247"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1254">246:5</a> These are the birds 'created for devouring dead matter' (see Bund. XIX, 25). Pahl. Vend. VII, 4 substitutes an eagle (dâlman) for the vulture.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1248"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1255">246:6</a> This sentence is probably defective, as the last clause evidently refers to the dog's gaze (see Pahl. Vend. III, 138), and not to the bird's shadow; the rule, however, is applicable to both. Thus the Persian Rivâyats state that if the bird's shadow falls upon the hair or the nails of the corpse, or if the bird's shadow, or the dog's gaze falls upon a corpse in the water, or upon its reflection in a mirror, the Nasû<i>s</i> is not destroyed. Dastûr Jâmâspji is of opinion that the utility of the bird's shadow is intended to apply only to cases of death in uninhabited places, where a dog is not procurable. As all three birds are such as feed upon corpses, it seems probable that the rule as to their utility was intended to prevent <a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a> any neglect of corpses found in wild places, where some of these birds would be sure to approach and let their shadows fall upon the dead. after which the finder of the corpse would suppose that the Nasû<i>s</i> was destroyed or driven away, and the corpse safer to approach.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1249"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1256">247:1</a> This is an exceptional case, when not more than two men are available; the usual custom (see Chap. X, 10) is to employ four men and two dogs (double the usual number) in disposing of the corpse of a pregnant woman, on account of the double risk of contamination, owing to the Nasû<i>s</i>, or fiend of corruption, having seized upon two corpses at once. In consequence of the exceptional nature of the case, the mode of purification is also exceptional.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1250"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1257">247:2</a> A long purification ceremony lasting nine nights, and described in Vend. IX, 1-145. Its name, according to Dastûr Hoshangji, is derived from the first word of the instructions for sprinkling the unclean person, which commence (Vend. IX, 48) as follows: Bareshnûm hê vaghdhanem paourum paiti-hi<i>n</i><i>k</i>ôi<i>s</i>, 'sprinkle in, front on the top of his head.' As it is usual to quote chapters by their initial words, the initial word of these instructions for the ceremony became a name for the ceremony itself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1251"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1258">247:3</a> The building in which the dead are finally deposited; here called by its Huzvâri<i>s</i> name, khazân. The Dakhmas used by the Parsis in India are like low circular towers in external appearance, and consist of a high wall enclosing a larger or smaller circular space which is open to the sky. The only opening in the wall is a small doorway, closed with an iron door. In the centre of the circular area is a circular well a few feet in depth, and the space around it is paved so as to slope gently downwards from the enclosing wall to the brink of the well. This paved annular area is divided (by shallow gutters grooved into its surface) into spaces, each large enough for one corpse to be laid, upon it, with the head towards the wall and the feet towards the well. These spaces are arranged in two or more concentric rings around the well, and the gutters (which isolate each space on all four sides) drain into the <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a> well. After a sufficient time has elapsed the dry bones are said to be thrown into the well, and when the well is full the Dakhma ought to be finally closed, and another one brought into use. These Dakhmas are erected upon some dry and barren spot, remote from habitations and water; upon the summit of a hill, if possible, as prescribed in Vend. VI, 93, and usually more than a mile from the town. In Bombay the town has gradually approached the Dakhmas, and to some extent surrounded them, but has been kept away from their immediate vicinity by the judicious measures of influential Parsis, who have acquired all the neighbouring land, and refrain from building on it. The reason for thus exposing their dead to the sun and carnivorous birds is that the Parsis consider fire, water, and earth too sacred to be defiled by corpses; and they have less consideration for the air. Next to burning, the Parsi mode of disposing of the dead is the most rapid and effectual, as it avoids most of the concentrated evils which must accumulate in crowded cemeteries in the course of time, and which require ages to dissipate. As it is, most of the offensive effluvium in the immediate vicinity of a Dakhma arises not from direct contamination of the air, but indirectly through the ground, which becomes polluted, in the course of time, by impure filtrations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1252"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1259">248:1</a> Dastûr Jâmâspji prefers reading patôshak, and thinks it means 'necessity,' as in cases where two deaths occur nearly simultaneously in the same house, when both corpses cannot be removed the same day. Such a meaning might suit this passage, but the word occurs again, in § 33 and Chap. IX, 7, where it can refer only to 'contamination,' and the etymology of pa<i>d</i>vîshak (Av. paiti + vish) is plain enough.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1253"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1260">248:2</a> That is, when two persons cannot be found to carry a corpse, one can do it alone, provided he holds a dog by a string. This course is adopted, Dastûr Jâmâspji says, when a person happens to die in a place where only one Parsi is available.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1254"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1261">249:1</a> In the terms a<i>v</i>î-dashtânŏ and a<i>v</i>î-nasâî the compound a<i>v</i> is written in an obsolete manner, both in M6 and K20. The meaning of the text is that either or both of the corpse-carriers may be any Parsi man, woman, or child who understands the proper precautions. Compare Pahl. Vend. VIII, 28.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1255"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1262">249:2</a> K20 has 'when curved it is not to be carried.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1256"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1263">249:3</a> That is, it is a mortal sin to allow rain to fall upon a corpse before it is deposited in the Dakhma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1257"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1264">249:4</a> Or 'withheld,' or 'continuous,' according as we compare hâmûn with Pers. âmûn (âman), amân, or hâmân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1258"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1265">249:5</a> Inside the Dakhma apparently. The meaning seems to be, that when the Dakhma is flooded the corpse is to be laid down in some dry place in its vicinity until the flood has abated. But according to Pahl. Vend. VIII, 17, it is allowable to throw the corpse in when the Dakhma is full of water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1259"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1266">249:6</a> See Chaps. I, 3, II, 1. Here, again, the quotation must be from his complete commentary, as it is not extant in the present Pahlavi Vendidad.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1260"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1267">249:7</a> From Av. var, 'to cover, to shelter;' compare Pers. gullah, 'a bower or shed.' Nowadays the Parsis have a permanent shelter near the Dakhma. Pahl. Vend. VIII, 17 says, 'to carry <a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a> an umbrella (a<i>v</i>argash) from behind, <i>or</i> to hold up a shelter, is of no use.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1261"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1268">250:1</a> Or, 'it would make <i>it</i> very dry,' if we read a<i>v</i>îr, 'very,' instead of a<i>g</i>îr, 'below;' these two words being written alike in Pahlavi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1262"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1269">250:2</a> Quoting again from his lost commentary.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1263"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1270">250:3</a> Or, perhaps, 'floor.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1264"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1271">250:4</a> This translation is somewhat doubtful, but the text seems to imply that the ground is polluted as deep as it contains no water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1265"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1272">250:5</a> K20 has had, 'the stone is all polluted, <i>and</i> will become clean at the time when they dig <i>it</i> up, the stone is all polluted, in so <a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a> much space as the corpse occupied <i>it is</i> polluted;' but the additional matter seems to be struck out. Something analogous to the details in this paragraph will be found in Pahl. Vend. VI, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1266"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1273">251:1</a> This section would be more appropriate in Chap. III.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1267"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1274">251:2</a> Or 'an upper floor;' Pahl. Vend. VI, 9 has, 'when he shall die on an upper floor, when nothing of him remains behind at the partitions (pardakân), the floor is polluted as far as the balcony (â<i>s</i>kûp) <i>and</i> the balcony alone is clean; when anything of him remains behind at the partitions, the floor is polluted as far as the balcony, the ground is polluted as far as the water, <i>about</i> the balcony alone it is not clear.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1268"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1275">251:3</a> See note on Chap. III, 32.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1269"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1276">251:4</a> The gâm, 'step,' being 2 feet 7½ inches (see note on Bund. XXVI, 3) these thirty steps are about 79 English feet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1270"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1277">251:5</a> Meaning uncertain; the word looks like Huzvâri<i>s</i>, but it is possible to read rî<i>d</i>-aê instead of rîtâ-1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1271"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1278">252:1</a> That is, the floor of the apartment; which would probably be formed of earth beaten down, which, in India, is nearly always overspread with diluted cow-dung to hinder cracks in the smooth surface. A better class of floor is spread with lime plaster on a stony surface.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1272"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1279">252:2</a> The object of these rules is evidently to avoid disturbing the corpse more than is absolutely necessary, provided there be no fear of its polluting more of the ground by falling upon it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1273"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1280">253:1</a> K20 has a portion of § 30 inserted here by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1274"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1281">253:2</a> The object of these rules is likewise to prevent the risk of the corpse defiling more of the ground than is absolutely necessary by falling upon it, as it might do by the breaking of a dead branch.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1275"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1282">253:3</a> Nasâî (Av. nasu) means not only a corpse or carcase of a human being, dog, or other animal of the good creation, but also any portion of such corpse or carcase; that is, <i>solid</i> 'dead matter' in general, as distinguished from dirt or refuse from the living body, or any <i>liquid</i> exudation from a corpse or carcase, which is called hîkhar (Av. hikhra).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1276"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1283">253:4</a> Pahl. Vend. VI, 9 states, that 'when <i>one</i> shall die on a jar of wine, the jar is useless, and the wine becomes just as though <i>its</i> <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a> course (ravi<i>s</i>n) had been within three steps <i>of the corpse</i>. And when he shall die in the wine, when nothing of him remains behind on the jar, the jar is proper on making <i>it</i> dry' (or, perhaps, 'the jar is fit for bran-flour').</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1277"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1284">254:1</a> Or 'clarified butter;' in this case the 'jar' is probably a globular vessel, or carboy, made of hide, through which the oil, or liquid butter, penetrates so far as to keep the outer surface greasy, which accounts for the remark about the oil passing in and out. Such vessels, called <i>d</i>abar, are commonly used for oil and liquid butter in India.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1278"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1285">254:2</a> Assuming that khû<i>s</i>kar stands for khû<i>s</i>k-kar, as it does in Pahl. Vend., VI, 71; otherwise we should have to read thus: 'and the jar is mot even fit to put any bran-flour in.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1279"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1286">254:3</a> Again assuming as in § 32; otherwise we must read thus: 'but is fit for bran-flour (khû<i>s</i>kar).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1280"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1287">255:1</a> Or 'a corpse;' K20 has 'stands upon.' The meaning is that these substances do not communicate the contamination throughout their own substance, but only downwards to the ground, which conveys it farther down, so far as it contains no water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1281"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1288">255:2</a> That is, these substances communicate the contamination throughout their own substance, but not down to the ground.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1282"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1289">255:3</a> The verb vi<i>d</i>ar<i>d</i>anŏ (Huz. vabrûntanŏ), 'to cross over, to pass away' (Av, vi + tar, Pers. guDHa<i>s</i>tan), can only be used when referring to the death of <i>good</i> people or animals; but the verb mûr<i>d</i>anŏ (Huz. yemîtûntanŏ), 'to die, to expire' (Av. mar, Pers. murdan), can be used generally, though usually applied to the wicked and to evil creatures. Pahl. Vend. V, 134 contains nearly the same text as §§ 38, 39.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1283"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1290">255:4</a> Under ordinary circumstances fire must not be brought within thirty steps, or about 79 English feet, of a corpse (see Vend. VIII, <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a> 17). But the spirit of the Mazdayasnian law is reasonable, and, although strict, it allows for practical difficulties and chooses the least of two evils in a more judicious manner than might be expected (a fact which it would be well for Parsis and others to observe in doubtful cases). Here, breaking through the wall of a house is considered a greater evil than the possible pollution of the fire by passing at a distance of three steps, or eight English feet, from a corpse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1284"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1291">256:1</a> The name of a commentator, or commentary, often quoted in Pahlavi translations (see, the note on Chap. I, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1285"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1292">256:2</a> Literally, 'destroying the consciousness,' or 'injuring the existence.' Bô<i>d</i>ôzê<i>d</i> or bô<i>d</i>yôza<i>d</i> is a particular kind of sin which appears to consist chiefly of the ill-treatment of animals and injury of useful property. It is mentioned in Pahl. Yas. XXIX, 1b, Pahl. Vend. V, 107, XIII, 38, Farh. Okh. pp. 32, 33; and in some editions of the Khurdah Avesta it is defined as selling stolen men or animals into misery, or one's own domestic cattle to the butcher, also spoiling and tearing up good clothing, or wasting and spoiling good food.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1286"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1293">256:3</a> The meaning is, that if it became necessary to break through the wall in order to remove the fire unpolluted, the sin committed through damaging the wall will not be punished either in this world or the next.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1304"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1312">259:5</a> Meaning, probably, the Nasû<i>s</i>, or demon of corruption (see § 1 who is said to rush upon all those polluted as detailed in Vend. V, 82-107.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1308"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1316">260:2</a> The meaning is not quite clear, but this sentence is probably to be read in connection with the preceding one, as implying that where such domestic animals are kept they can be used for stopping the infection, as effectually as any inanimate object. The pig is here mentioned as a common domestic animal, but Parsis have long since adopted the prejudices of Hindus and Muhammadans as regards the uncleanness of the pig.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1309"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1317">260:3</a> As Vend. V, 108-112 says the same of the dog urupi, it would seem that the writer of our text considered the urupi to be a hedgehog (zûzak); the Pahlavi translation of the Vendidad renders it by rapuk or rîpûk, which appears to be merely an approximate transcript of the Avesta word; traditionally, this is read raspûk and compared with Pers. râsû, 'ichneumon;' its identification with the hedgehog is certainly doubtful, although it appears to be admitted in Pahl. Vend. V, 112, where the same words are used as in this section.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1310"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1318">260:4</a> The technical terms hamrê<i>d</i> and paîtrê<i>d</i>, for contagion and infection, are merely corruptions of Av. hãm-raêthwayêiti and paiti-raêthwayêiti. The definition of the latter one is omitted in K20 by mistake.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1312"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1320">261:2</a> Vend. V, 86, 87 limits the pollution to the eleventh person infected, in the extreme case of the corpse having been a priest; but Pahl. Vend. V, 107 quotes the opinion of Sôshâns that until a dog has gazed at the corpse the pollution extends to the twelfth, but only the first ten require the ceremonial purification of the bareshnûm, the others being cleansed by ordinary washing with bull's urine and water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1313"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1321">261:3</a> Pahl. Vend. V, 107 states, however, that 'everything of the ape (kapîk) is just like mankind.' The meaning of § 61 is very uncertain, as the text can be both read and translated several ways, and none of them are very satisfactory.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1314"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1322">261:4</a> That is, in the case of the shepherd's dog (see Vend. V, 92, 93); the carcases of other dogs occasion the indirect pollution of fewer persons, in proportion to their inferior importance; but Pahl. Vend. V, 107 states, with regard to this importance, that when 'in doubt, every man is to be considered as a priest, and every dog as a shepherd's dog,' so as to be on the safe side, by exacting, the maximum amount of purification in all doubtful cases.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1315"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1323">261:5</a> The Pahlavi text leaves it doubtful whether the place, the people, or the carcase becomes clean, but the first is the most probable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1316"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1324">262:1</a> That is, he has committed a sin equivalent to three mortal sins (marg-ar<i>g</i>ân).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1322"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1330">262:7</a> This exception (which is repeated in §§ 68, 71) seems to imply that §§ 66, 68, 71 refer to the collection of any fragments of a corpse found in the wilderness, or in water; and the exemption from the troublesome purification ceremony in such cases, is probably intended to encourage people to undertake the disagreeable duty of attending to such fragments.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1323"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1331">263:1</a> The interposition of the stake, or piece of wood, prevents the direct attack of the Nasû<i>s</i>, or demon of corruption, which has not been driven away by a dog.

 <p><a name="fn_1331"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1339">264:4</a> There is some uncertainty about this word. It is not the Pers. badtum, 'worst, vilest,' because that is written va<i>d</i>tûm or vatûm in Pahlavi; besides, the rule must apply to other than the vilest doors, otherwise it would not harmonize with § 75. It is not a miswriting of nîtûm, 'lowest, most debased,' for the same reason, and because it occurs elsewhere. It is not a miswriting of bêtman, a possible variant of bêtâ, 'a house' (although 'a house-door' would suit the context very well), because it occurs also in Pahl. Vend. V, 14, XI, 10, in which latter place it is clearly an adjective partially translating Av. b<i>e</i>ndvô. And it would be hazardous to connect it with Pers. bîdûn, 'outside,' which seems merely a corruption or misreading of bîrûn. The view taken here is that badtûm stands for bandtûm, 'most shut up,' the nasal being often dropped in Pahlavi, as in sag for sang, 'stone,' &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1338"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1346">266:1</a> The sentence is obscure, but this seems to be the meaning; that is, when a corpse or any dead matter is thrown into a pond or tank, the pollution extends sixteen feet from it in all directions; and that quantity of water ought to be drawn off, in order to purify the tank (see Vend. VI, 65-71). As the corpse, in nearly all cases, must be either at the bottom or on the surface, the quantity of polluted water to be drawn off must be a hemispherical mass sixteen feet in radius, or about forty-eight tons of water.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1375"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1384">272:5</a> Compare Pahl. Vend. VII, 192.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1376"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1385">273:1</a> The purification here detailed is prescribed for golden vessels in Vend. VII, 186.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1377"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1386">273:2</a> This is the purification prescribed for silver vessels in Vend. VII, 74 W.; it is found in the Vendidad Sâdah, but is omitted (evidently by mistake) in the Vendidad with Pahlavi translation, and has, therefore, been omitted in Spiegel's edition of the texts. By this accidental omission in the MSS. silver is connected with the purification for stone (see § 114).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1378"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1387">273:3</a> See Vend. VII, 75 W., much of which is omitted in the Vendidad with Pahlavi translation, and in Spiegel's edition (see the preceding note), the sixfold washing of stone being erroneously applied to silver (see Vend. VII, 187 Sp.), owing to this omission of the intervening text. It appears from this section that the AV. haosafna, which has usually been translated as 'copper,' was understood to be pûlâ<i>v</i><i>d</i>, 'steel,' by the Pahlavi translators.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1379"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1388">273:4</a> Or 'a mirror' (Pers. âbgînah), but the word is evidently used for a metal in SZS. X, 2, and very likely here also.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1380"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1389">273:5</a> Most of the substances mentioned in §§ 115, 116 are detailed in Pahl. Vend. VII, 188, where it is stated that 'as to the pearl <i>there</i> have been different opinions, some say that it is <i>liable</i> just like gold, some say that it is just like the other jewels, <i>and</i> some say that there is no washing <i>for it</i>.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1381"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1390">274:1</a> This is doubtful; the word can be read pirînak, and has the Pers. gloss pîrûzah, 'turquoise,' in some MSS. If read pilînak it might perhaps be taken for 'ivory.' But in Pahl. Vend. VII, 188 it is vafarinô, 'snowy,' and the reading there seems to be 'jet-black <i>and</i> snow-white stone-coral;' so here the original meaning may have been 'snow-white, and jet-black coral-stone.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1382"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1391">274:2</a> Vend. VII, 188 says that 'earthen or wooden or porcelain <i>vessels</i> are impure for everlasting.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1383"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1392">274:3</a> Meaning, apparently, that they cannot be purified for immediate use.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1384"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1393">274:4</a> That is, one-sixth longer than when green, the vitast being twelve finger-<i>breadths</i>, or nine inches (see Bund. XXVI, 3, note). The purification of firewood, here prescribed, is simply drying it for a year in short lengths; but Vend. VII, 72-82 requires it also to be sprinkled once with water, and to be cut into longer pieces.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1385"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1394">274:5</a> See Chap. I, 3. </p>
 <p><a name="fn_1386"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1395">274:6</a> See Chap. I, 4, note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1387"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1396">275:1</a> Something similar is said in Pahl. Vend. VI, 71.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1388"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1397">275:2</a> According to Vend. VII, 83-93 polluted corn and fodder are to be treated like polluted firewood, but to be cut into pieces of about double the length.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1389"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1398">275:3</a> Reading dên gôpân farôstak; the practice of storing corn in dry pits underground is common in the East and in some parts of Europe. In Pahl. Vend. VII, 93 it is den gôpân âvist, 'concealed in pits.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1390"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1399">275:4</a> See Chap. I, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1391"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1400">275:5</a> Pahl. Vend. VII, 93 classes the almond with the walnut as a connected fruit and the date with the pomegranate as a separated one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1392"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1401">275:6</a> The word is kûrâpak or kûrâ<i>z</i>ak, but its meaning is doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1393"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1402">276:1</a> Pahl. Vend. VII, 9 3 says, 'fruit whose rind (pazâ<i>v</i>) exists is also just like that in a pod (kûvak), and <i>for</i> that which does not remain in a rind, when <i>pollution</i> shall come upon it, <i>there</i> is no <i>cleansing</i> whatever. Afarg said that <i>there</i> is ever a rind (pazâ<i>v</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) with the citron.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1394"></a><a href="sbe0562.htm#fr_1403">276:2</a> Pahl. Vend. VII, 93 says, '<i>for</i> everything separated <i>there</i> is a washing, except meat <i>and</i> milk.' Articles for which there is no washing cannot be purified.</p>
