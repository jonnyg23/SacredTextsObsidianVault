 <p>1. The second conflict was waged with the water, because, as the star Tî<i>s</i>tar <i>was</i> in Cancer, the water which is in the subdivision they call Avrak <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">3</font></a> was</p>

 <p>pouring, on the same day when the destroyer rushed in, <i>and</i> came again into notice for mischief (âvârak) in the direction of the west. 2. For every single month is the owner of one constellation; the month Tîr is the fourth month <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the year, <i>and</i> Cancer the fourth constellation from Aries, so it is the owner of Cancer, into which Tî<i>s</i>tar sprang, <i>and</i> displayed the characteristics of a producer of rain; and he brought on the water aloft by the strength of the wind. 3. Co-operators with Tî<i>s</i>tar were Vohûman and the angel Hôm, with the assistance of the angel Bûr<i>g</i> and the righteous guardian spirits in orderly arrangement.</p>  
 <p>4. Tî<i>s</i>tar was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form of a horse and the form of a bull <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">2</font></a>; thirty days <i>and</i> nights he was distinguished in brilliance <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and in each form he produced rain ten days <i>and</i> nights; as the astrologers say that every constellation has three forms. 5. Every single drop of that rain became as big as a bowl, and the water stood the height of a man over the whole of this earth; <i>and</i> the noxious creatures on the earth being all killed by the rain, went into the holes of the earth <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>6. And, afterwards, the wind spirit, so that it may not be contaminated (gûmîkht), stirs up the wind <i>and</i> atmosphere as the life stirs in the body; and the water was all swept away by it, and was brought out to the borders of the earth, and the wide-formed <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a> ocean arose therefrom. 7. The noxious creatures remained dead within the earth, and their venom and stench were mingled with the earth, and in order to carry that poison away from the earth Tî<i>s</i>tar went down into the ocean in the form of a white horse with long hoofs <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. And Apâôsh <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the demon, came meeting him in the likeness of a black horse with clumsy (kund) hoofs; a mile (parasang) <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">4</font></a> away from him fled Tî<i>s</i>tar, through the fright which drove <i>him</i> away. 9. And Tî<i>s</i>tar begged for success from Aûharmazd, and Aûharmazd gave <i>him</i> strength and power, as it is said, that unto Tî<i>s</i>tar was brought at once the strength of ten vigorous horses, ten vigorous camels, ten vigorous bulls, ten mountains, and ten rivers <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 10. A mile away from him fled Apâôsh, the demon, through fright at <i>his</i> strength; on account of this they speak of an arrow-<i>shot</i> with Tî<i>s</i>tar's strength in the sense <i>of a mile</i>.</p>

 <p>11. Afterwards, with a cloud for a jar (khûmb)thus they call the measure which was a means of the workhe seized upon the water <i>and</i> made it rain most prodigiously, in drops <i>like</i> bull's heads and men's heads, pouring in handfuls <i>and</i> pouring in armfuls, both great and small. 12. On the production of that rain the demons Aspen<i>g</i>argâk <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>and</i> Apâôsh contended <i>with it</i>, and the fire Vâzist <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">2</font></a> turned <i>its</i> club over; and owing to the blow of the club Aspen<i>g</i>argâk made a very grievous noise, as even now, in a conflict with the producer of rain, a groaning and raging <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">3</font></a> are manifest. 13. And ten nights and days rain was produced by him in that manner, and the poison and venom of the noxious creatures which were in the earth were, all mixed up in the water, and the water became quite salt, because there remained in the earth <i>some</i> of those germs which noxious creatures ever collect.</p>  
 <p>14. Afterwards, the wind, in the same manner <i>as before</i>, restrained the water, at the end of three days, on various sides of the earth; and the three great seas <i>and</i> twenty-three small seas <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">4</font></a> arose therefrom, <i>and</i> two fountains (<i>k</i>ashmak) of the sea thereby became manifest, one the <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast lake, and one the Sôvbar <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">5</font></a>, whose sources are connected with the</p>

 <p>fountain of the sea. 15. And at its north side <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">1</font></a> two rivers flowed out, <i>and</i> went one to the east <i>and</i> one to the west; they are the Arag river and the Vêh river; as it is said thus: 'Through those finger-breadth tricklings do thou pour <i>and</i> draw forth two such waters, O Aûharmazd!' 16. Both those rivers wind about through all the extremities of the earth, and intermingle again with the water of the wide-formed ocean. 17. As those two rivers flowed out, <i>and</i> from the same place of origin as theirs, eighteen <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">2</font></a> navigable rivers flowed out, and after the other waters have flowed out from those navigable <i>streams</i> they all flow back to the Arag <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">3</font></a> river and Vêh river, whose fertilization (khvâpardârîh) of the world <i>arises</i> therefrom.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="sbe0516.htm#fr_125">26:4</a> In comparing the inundation produced by Tî<i>s</i>tar, with the Noachian deluge, it must be recollected that the former is represented as occurring before mankind had propagated on the earth.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_133"></a><a href="sbe0516.htm#fr_133">28:3</a> Or, 'a tumult and flashing.' Justi has 'howling and shrieking;' the two words being very ambiguous in the original.</p>
