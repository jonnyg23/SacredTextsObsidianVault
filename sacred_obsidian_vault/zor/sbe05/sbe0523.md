 <p>1. On the nature of the five classes of animals (gôspend) it says in revelation, that, when the primeval ox passed away <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">4</font></a>, there where the marrow came out grain grew up <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">5</font></a>, of fifty and five species, <i>and</i> twelve <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">6</font></a> species of medicinal plants grew; as it says, that out of the marrow is every separate creature, every single thing whose lodgment is in the marrow <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">7</font></a>. 2. From the horns <i>arose</i> peas (mî<i>g</i>ûk),</p>

 <p>from the nose the leek, from the blood the grapevine <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">1</font></a> from which they make wineon this account wine abounds with bloodfrom the lungs the rue-like herbs, from the middle of the heart <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">2</font></a> thyme <i>for</i> keeping away stench, <i>and</i> every one of the others as revealed in the Avesta.</p>  
 <p>3. The seed of the ox was carried up to the moon station <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">3</font></a>; there it was thoroughly purified, <i>and</i> produced the manifold species of animals <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 4. First, two oxen, one male and one female, and, afterwards, one pair of every single species was let go into the earth, <i>and</i> was discernible in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> <i>for</i> a Hâsar ('mile'), which is like a Parasang ('league') <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">5</font></a>; as it says, that, on account of the valuableness of the ox, it was created twice, one time as an ox, and one time as the manifold species of animals. 5. A thousand days and nights they were without eating, and first water and afterwards herbage (aûrvar) were devoured by them.</p>  
 <p>6. And, afterwards, the three classes (kar<i>d</i>ak) of animals were produced therefrom, as it says that first were the goat and sheep, and then the camel</p>

 <p>and swine, and then the horse and ass. 7. For, first, <i>those</i> suitable for grazing were created therefrom, those are now kept in the valley (lâî); the second created were those of the hill summits (sar-i dê<i>z</i>) <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which are wide-travellers, <i>and</i> habits (nihâdak) are not taught to them by hand; the third created were <i>those</i> dwelling in the water.</p>  
 <p>8. As for the genera (khadûînak), the first genus is that which <i>has</i> the foot cloven in two, <i>and is</i> suitable for grazing; of which a camel larger than a horse is small <i>and</i> new-born. 9. The second genus is ass-footed, of which the swift <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">2</font></a> horse is the largest, <i>and</i> the ass the least. 10. The third genus is that of the five-dividing paw, of which the dog is the largest, <i>and</i> the civet-cat the least. 11. The fourth genus is the flying, of which the griffon of three natures <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the largest, and the chaffinch <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">4</font></a> the least. 12. The fifth genus is that of the water, of which the Kar fish <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">5</font></a> is the largest, <i>and</i> the Nemadu <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">6</font></a> the least.</p>

 <p>two hundred and eighty-two <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">1</font></a> species (sar<i>d</i>ak). 14. First are five species of goat, the ass-goat <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the milch-goat, the mountain-goat, the fawn, <i>and</i> the <i>common</i> goat. 15. Second, five species of sheep, that with a tail, that which has no tail, the dog-sheep, the wether, <i>and</i> the Kûri<i>s</i>k sheep, a sheep whose horn is great; it possesses a grandeur <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">3</font></a> like unto a horse, <i>and</i> they use <i>it</i> mostly for a steed (bâra), as it is said that Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar kept a Kûri<i>s</i>k as a steed. 16. Third, two species of camel, the mountain <i>one and that</i> suitable for grazing; for one is fit to keep in the mountain, <i>and</i> one in the plain; they are one-humped <i>and</i> two-humped. 17. Fourth, fifteen species of ox, the white, mud-coloured <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">4</font></a>, red, yellow, black, <i>and</i> dappled, the elk, the buffalo, the camel-leopard ox, the fish-chewing <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">5</font></a> ox, the Far<i>s</i> ox, the Ka<i>g</i><i>a</i>u, <i>and</i> other species of ox. 18. Fifth, eight species of horse, the Arab, the Persian, the mule <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the ass, the wild ass (gôr), the hippopotamus (asp-i âvî), <i>and</i> other species of horse. 19. Sixth, ten species of dog, the shepherd's dog, the village-dog which is the house-protector, the blood-hound, the slender hound <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">7</font></a>, the</p>

 <p>water-beaver <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">1</font></a> which they call the water-dog, the fox, the ichneumon (râsu), the hedgehog which they call 'thorny-back,' the porcupine <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and</i> the civet-cat; of which, two species are those accustomed <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">3</font></a> to burrows, one the fox <i>and</i> one the ichneumon; <i>and</i> those accustomed to jungle are such as the porcupine which has spines on <i>its</i> back, <i>and</i> the hedgehog which is similar. 20. Seventh, five species of the black <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">4</font></a> hare; two are wild species, one dwelling in a burrow <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>and</i> one dwelling in the jungle. 21. Eighth, eight species of weasel; one the marten, one the black marten, the squirrel, the B<i>e</i>z ermine <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the white ermine, <i>and</i> other species of weasel. 22. Ninth, eight species of musk <i>animals</i>; one is that which is recognised by <i>its</i> musk <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">7</font></a>, one</p>

 <p>the musk <i>animal</i> with a bag in which is their pleasant scent, the Bi<i>s</i>-musk <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a> which eats the Bi<i>s</i>-<i>herb</i>, the black musk which is the enemy of the serpent <i>that is</i> numerous in rivers, <i>and</i> other species of musk <i>animals</i>. 23. Tenth, one hundred and ten species of birds; flying creatures (vey = vâî) such as the griffon bird <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Kar<i>s</i>ipt <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the eagle, the Kahrkâs <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">4</font></a> which they call the vulture, the crow, the Ardâ, the crane, <i>and</i> the tenth <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">5</font></a> is the bat. 24. There are two of them which have milk in the teat <i>and</i> suckle <i>their</i> young, the griffon bird and the bat which flies in the night; as they say that the bat is created of three races (sar<i>d</i>ak), the race (âyina) of the dog, the bird, <i>and</i> the musk <i>animal</i>; for it flies like a bird, has many teeth like a dog, <i>and</i> is dwelling in holes like a musk-rat. 25. These hundred and ten species of birds are distributed into eight groups (khadûînak), mostly as scattered about as when a man scatters seed, <i>and</i> drops the seed in <i>his</i> fingers to the ground, large, middling, <i>and</i> small. 26. Eleventh <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">6</font></a>, fish were created of ten</p>

 <p>species; first, the fish Ari<i>z</i> <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the Arzuvâ, the Arzukâ, the Marzukâ, <i>and</i> other Avesta names <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 27. Afterwards, within each species, species within species are created, so the total is two hundred and eighty-two species <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>28. Of the dog they say that out of the star station, that is, <i>away</i> from the direction of the constellation Haptôk-rîng, was given to him further by a stage (yô<i>g</i>ist) <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">4</font></a> than to men, on account of <i>his</i> protection of sheep, <i>and</i> as associating with sheep <i>and</i> men; for this the dog is purposely adapted <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">5</font></a>, as three more kinds of advantage are given to him than <i>to</i> man, <i>he has</i> his own boots, his own clothing <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>and</i> may wander about without self-exertion. 29. The twelfth <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">7</font></a> is the sharp-toothed beast of</p>

 <p>which the leader of the flock is in such great fear, for that flock of sheep is very badly maintained which has no dog.</p>  
 <p>30. Aûharmazd said when the bird Vâresha <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">1</font></a> was created by him, <i>which</i> is a bird of prey, thus: 'Thou art created by me, O bird Vâresha! so that my vexation may be greater than <i>my</i> satisfaction with thee, for thou doest the will of the evil spirit more than that of me; like the wicked man who did not become satiated with wealth, thou also dost not become satiated with the slaughter of birds; but if thou be not created by me, O bird Vâresha! thou wouldst be created by him, the evil spirit, <i>as</i> a kite <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">2</font></a> with the body of a Varpa <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">3</font></a>, by which no creature would be left alive.'</p>  
 <p>31. Many animals are created in all these species for this reason, that when one shall be perishing <i>through</i> the evil spirit, one shall remain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_238">46:4</a> This translation suits both text and context very welt but gôspend pûr-sar<i>d</i>ak is evidently intended for the Av. gâu<i>s</i> pouru-saredhô, 'the ox of many species,' of Mâh Yt. 0, 7, and Sîrôz. 12.</p>

XVI, 70 and XXVI). The phrase in the text probably means merely that a Hâsar is a measure for long distances, just as a Parasang is.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_240">47:1</a> Justi reads gîrîsa<i>k</i>, the Av. gairishâ<i>k</i>ô, 'mountain-frequenting,' of Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 36; but this is doubtful.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_242">47:3</a> The Paz. sin-i se avinâ is the Pahl. sên-i 3 khadûînak of Chap. XXIV, II, 29, the Sîn bird or Sîmurgh of Persian legends, the Av. saêna. The word avinâ is a Pâz. misreading either of âînak, 'kind, sort,' or of an<i>g</i>anâk, 'dividing.' The mixture of Pâzand and Pahlavi in this and some other chapters is rather perplexing, but the Pâzand misreadings can usually be corrected after transliterating them back into Pahlavi characters.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_245">47:6</a> If this Pâzand word be written in Pahlavi letters it may be read va magan, which may stand for va magil, 'and the leech;', but this is very uncertain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_249">48:4</a> Pâz. ashgun is evidently for Pahl. ha<i>s</i>gûn.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_251">48:6</a> Instead of these first three species M6 has 'the white, black, yellow, bay, <i>and</i> chestnut.' K20 omits 'the ass' by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_252">48:7</a> These first four species are the Av. pasu<i>s</i>-haurvô, vi<i>s</i>-haurvô, vôhunazgô, and taurunô of Vend. V, 92-98, XIII, 21, 26-74, 117, 164, 165.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_254">49:2</a> The word indra has usually been taken as a Pâz. misreading of the Pahl. aûdrak (Av. udra, 'otter,' of Vend. XIII, 48, 167, 169, XIV, 2), but this would be more probably read andra. The Pahl. sûgar, 'porcupine,' is just as likely to be misread indra, and its meaning suits the context better.</p>

(the z in M6 being shaped something like dh), and Justi supposes it represents the Arabic abyadh or baîdhâ, 'white,' and is explained by the Pers. sapêd, 'white,' which follows; but there is nothing in the text to indicate that the second name is an explanation of the first. It is more probable that b<i>e</i>z represents the Pers. bî<i>g</i>âd, 'reddish, rufous, variegated,' an epithet quite applicable to the ermine in its summer fur.</p>

It has been generally supposed that we should read 'eleventh,' and consider the bats as an eleventh group, especially as the MSS. call the next group (the fish) the 'twelfth;' but this view is contradicted by the remarks about the bats being mingled with those about the birds, and also by Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam in his Selections, Chap. IX, 14 (see App. to Bund.), not mentioning any group of bats among the other animals.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_265">50:6</a> All the MSS. have 'twelfth,' but they give no 'eleventh' nor 'thirteenth,' though they have 'fourteenth' in § 29. These irregularities <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> seem to indicate that part of this chapter has been omitted by some old copyist.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_268">51:3</a> K20 alone has 272 (see Chap. X, 3). The actual total number of species mentioned is 186, leaving ninety-six for the 'species within species.' Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam in his Selections, Chap. IX, 14, differs from the numbers given in the text merely in giving ten species of ox, instead of fifteen; so the total of his details is 181, leaving 101 sub-species to make up his; grand total of 282 (see App. to Bund.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_268"></a><a href="sbe0523.htm#fr_269">51:4</a> A yô<i>g</i>ist (compare Sans. yo<i>g</i>ana) was probably from fifteen to sixteen English miles, as it consisted of sixteen hâsar, each of one thousand steps of the two feet (see Chap.
