 <p>[1. On the evil-doing of Aharman <i>and</i> the demons it says in revelation, that the evil which the evil spirit has produced for the creation of Aûharmazd it is possible to tell by this winter <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and his body is that of a lizard (vazagh) <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>whose</i> place is filth (kal<i>k</i>). 2. He does not think, nor speak, nor act <i>for</i> the welfare (nadûkîh) of the creatures of Aûharmazd; and his business is unmercifulness and the destruction of this <i>welfare</i>, so that the creatures which Aûharmazd shall increase he will destroy; and <i>his</i> eyesight (<i>k</i>ashm mî<i>k</i>i<i>s</i>n) <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">6</font></a> does not refrain from doing the creatures harm. 3. As it says that, 'ever</p>

 <p>since a creature was created by, us, I, who am Aûharmazd, have not rested at ease, on account of providing protection for my own creatures; and likewise not even he, the evil spirit, on account of contriving evil for the creatures.' 4. And by <i>their</i> devotion to witchcraft (yâtûk-dînôîh) he seduces mankind into affection for himself and disaffection to Aûharmazd <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">1</font></a>, so that they forsake the religion of Aûharmazd, and practise that of Aharman. 5. He casts this into the thoughts of men, that this religion of Aûharmazd is nought, and it is not necessary to be steadfast in it. 6. Whoever gives that man anything, in whose law (dâ<i>d</i>) this saying is established, then the evil spirit is propitiated by him, that is, he has acted by his pleasure.</p>  
 <p>7. The business of Akôman <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">2</font></a> is this, that he gave vile thoughts and discord to the creatures. 8. The business of the demon Andar is this, that he constrains the thoughts of the creatures from deeds of virtue, just like a leader who <i>has</i> well-constrained (sardâr-i khûp afsâr<i>d</i>ŏ); <i>and</i> he casts this into the thoughts of men, that it is not necessary to have the <i>sacred</i> shirt <i>and thread</i>-girdle. 9. The business of the demon Sâvar <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">3</font></a>, that is a leader of the demons, is this, that is, misgovernment, oppressive anarchy, and drunkenness. 10. The business of the demon Nâîkîyas <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">4</font></a> is this, that he gives discontent to the creatures; as it says, that should this <i>one</i></p>

 <p>give anything to those men whose opinion (dâ<i>d</i>) is this, that it is not necessary to have the <i>sacred</i> shirt <i>and thread</i>-girdle, then Andar, Sâvar, and Nâîkîyas are propitiated by him. 11. The demon Taprê<i>v</i> <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">1</font></a> is he who mingles poison with plants and creatures; as it says thus: 'Taprê<i>v</i> the frustrater, <i>and</i> Zâîrî<i>k</i> the maker of poison.' 12. All those six, it is said, are arch-fiends <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the demons; the rest are cooperating and confederate with them. 13. This, too, it says, that] <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">3</font></a> should <i>one</i> give [anything to] a man who says [that it is proper to have one boot], and in his law walking with one boot [is established, then] <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">4</font></a> the fiend Taprê<i>v</i> is propitiated [by him].</p>  
 <p>14. The demon Tarômat <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">5</font></a> [is he who] produces disobedience; the demon Mîtôkht <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">6</font></a> is the liar (drô<i>g</i>an) of the evil spirit <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">7</font></a>; the demon Ara<i>s</i>k <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">8</font></a> ('malice') is the spiteful fiend of the evil eye. 15. Theirs are the same <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">9</font></a> appliances as the demon Aeshm's <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">10</font></a>, as it</p>

 <p>says that seven powers are given <i>to</i> Aeshm <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that he may utterly destroy the creatures therewith; with those seven powers he will destroy seven <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the Kayân heroes in his own time, <i>but</i> one will remain. 16. There where Mîtôkht ('falsehood') arrives, Ara<i>s</i>k ('malice') becomes welcome, [and there where Ara<i>s</i>k is welcome] <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">3</font></a> Aeshm lays a foundation <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and there where Aeshm has a foundation <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">5</font></a> many creatures perish, <i>and</i> he causes much non-Iranianism <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 17. Aeshm mostly contrives all evil for the creatures of Aûharmazd, <i>and</i> the evil deeds of those Kayân heroes have been more complete through Aeshm, as it says, that Aeshm, the impetuous assailant, causes them most <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>18. The demon Vîzarêsh <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">8</font></a> is he who struggles with the souls of men which <i>have</i> departed, those</p>

 <p>days and nights <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">1</font></a> when <i>they remain</i> in the world; he carries <i>them</i> on, terror-stricken, <i>and</i> sits at the gate of hell. 19. The demon Uda <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">2</font></a> is he who, when a man sits in a private place, or when he eats at meals, strikes <i>his</i> knee spiritually on <i>his</i> back <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">3</font></a>, so that he bawls out [<i>and</i> looks out, that chattering he may eat, chattering] he may evacuate (rîe<i>d</i>), and chattering he may make water (mêzê<i>d</i>), so that he may not attain [unto the] best existence <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">4</font></a> .</p>  
 <p>[20. The demon Akâtâsh <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">5</font></a> is the fiend of perversion (nikîrâyîh), who makes the creatures averse (nikîrâî) from proper things; as it says, that whoever <i>has</i> given anything to that person (tanû) whose opinion (dâ<i>d</i>) is this, that it is not necessary to have a high-priest (dastôbar), then the demon Aeshm is propitiated by him. 21. Whoever <i>has</i> given anything to that person whose opinion is this, <i>and</i> who says, that it is not necessary to have a snake-killer (mâr-van), then Aharman, with the foregoing demons, is propitiated by him; this is said of him who, when he sees a noxious creature, does not kill <i>it</i>. 22. A snake-killer (mâro-gnô) <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">6</font></a> is a stick on the end of which a leathern <i>thong</i> is</p>

 <p>provided; and it is declared that every one of the good religion must possess one, that they may strike <i>and</i> kill noxious creatures <i>and</i> sinners more meritoriously with it.</p>  
 <p>23. Zarmân <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">1</font></a> is the demon who makes decrepit (dûspa<i>d</i>), whom they call old age (pirîh). 24. <i>K</i>îshmak <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">2</font></a> is he who makes disastrous (vazandak), and also causes the whirlwind <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>which</i> passes over for disturbance. 25. The demon Varenô <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">4</font></a> is he who causes illicit intercourse, as it says thus: 'Varenô the defiling (âlâî).' 26. The demon Bûshâsp <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">5</font></a> is she who causes slothfulness; Sê<i>g</i> is the fiend (drû<i>g</i>) who causes annihilation; and the demon Nîyâz is he who <i>causes</i> distress.</p>  
 <p>27. The demon Âz <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">6</font></a> ('greediness') is he who swallows everything, and when, through destitution, nothing has come he eats himself; he is that fiendishness which, although the whole wealth of the world be given up to it, does not fill up and is not satisfied; as it says, that the eye of the covetous is a noose (gamand), and <i>in</i> it the world is nought. 28. Pû<i>s</i> <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">7</font></a> is the demon who makes a hoard, <i>and</i></p>

 <p>does not consume <i>it, and</i> does not give to any one; as it says, that the power of the demon Âz is owing to that person who, not content with his own wife, snatches away even those of others.</p>  
 <p>29. The demon Nas <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">1</font></a> is he who causes the pollution and contamination (nisrû<i>s</i>tih), which they call nasâi ('dead matter'). 30. The demon Frîftâr ('deceiver') is he who seduces mankind. 31. The demon Spazg <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">2</font></a> ('slander') is he who brings <i>and</i> conveys discourse (milayâ), <i>and</i> it is nothing in appearance such <i>as</i> he says; and he shows that mankind fights <i>and</i> apologizes (avakhshînê<i>d</i>), individual with individual. 32. The demon Arâst <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">3</font></a> ('untrue') is he who speaks falsehood. 33. The demon Aîghâsh <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">4</font></a> is the malignant-eyed fiend who smites mankind with <i>his</i> eye. 24. The demon Bût <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">5</font></a> is he whom they worship among the Hindûs, and his growth is lodged in idols, as one worships the horse <i>as</i> an idol <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 35 Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">7</font></a> is the evil flyer (vâê-i sarîtar) who seizes the life; as it says that, when</p>

 <p><i>his</i> hand strokes a man <i>it is</i> lethargy, when he casts <i>it</i> on the sick <i>one it is</i> fever, when he looks in his eyes he drives away the life, and they call it death. 36. The demon of the malignant eye (sûr-<i>k</i>ashmîh) is he who will spoil anything which men see, <i>when</i> they do not say 'in the name of God' (yazdân).</p>  
 <p>37. With every one of them are many demons <i>and</i> fiends co-operating, to specify whom a second time <i>would be</i> tedious; demons, too, who are furies (khashmakân), are in great multitude it is said. 38. They are demons of ruin, pain, and growing old (zvârân), producers of vexation and bile, revivers of grief (nîvagîh), the progeny of gloom, and bringers of stench, decay, and vileness, who are many, very numerous, and very notorious; and a portion of all of them is mingled in the bodies of men, <i>and their</i> characteristics are glaring in mankind.</p>  
 <p>39. The demon Apâôsh <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the demon Aspen<i>g</i>argâk <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">2</font></a> are those who remain in contest with the rain. 40. Of the evil spirit <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">3</font></a> are the law of vileness, the religion of sorcery, the weapons of fiendishness, and the perversion (khâmîh) of God's works; and</p>

 <p>his wish is this, that is: 'Do not ask <i>about</i> me, and do not understand me! for if ye ask <i>about</i> and understand me, ye <i>will</i> not come after me <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 41. This, too, it says, that the evil spirit remains at the distance of a cry, even at the cry of a three-year-old cock (kûlêng), even at the cry of an ass, even at the cry of a righteous man when <i>one</i> strikes <i>him</i> involuntarily <i>and</i> he utters a cry <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 42. The demon Kûndak <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">3</font></a> is he who is, the steed (bârak) of wizards.</p>  
 <p>43. Various new demons <i>arise</i> from the various new sins the creatures may commit, <i>and</i> are produced for such <i>purposes</i>; who make even those planets rush <i>on</i> which are in the <i>celestial</i> sphere, <i>and</i> they stand very numerously in the conflict. 44. Their ringleaders (kamârîkân) are those seven <i>planets</i>, the head and tail of Gô<i>k</i>îhar, and Mû<i>s</i>par <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>provided with a tail, <i>which</i> are ten. 45. And by them these ten worldly creations, <i>that</i> is, the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, metals, wind, light, fire, and mankind, are corrupted with all this vileness; and from them calamity, captivity, disease, death, and other evils and corruptions ever come to water, vegetation, and the other creations which exist <i>in</i> the world, owing to the fiendishness of those ten. 46. They whom I <i>have</i> enumerated are <i>furnished</i> with the assistance and crafty (afzar-hômand) nature of Aharman.</p>  
 <p>47. Regarding the cold, dry, stony, and dark interior of mysterious (târîk dên afrâ<i>g</i>-pê<i>d</i>âk) hell it says, that the darkness is fit to grasp with the hand <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the stench is fit to cut with a knife; and if they inflict the punishment of a thousand men within a single span, they (the men) think in this <i>way</i>, that they are alone; <i>and</i> the loneliness is worse than its punishment <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 48. And its connection (band) is with the seven planets, be it through much cold like Saturn <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">3</font></a> (Kêvân), be it through much heat like Aharman; and their food is brimstone (gandak), and of succulents the lizard (vazagh), <i>and</i> other evil <i>and</i> wretchedness (patyân).]</p>

 <p><a name="fn_597"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_602">108:4</a> Reading bunak as in TD; K20 has 'sends down a root.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_600"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_605">108:7</a> The word vêsh, 'most,' is only in TD.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_601"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_606">108:8</a> So in TD; K20 has Vi<i>g</i>êsh. He is the Av. Vîzaresha of Vend. XIX, 94, who is said to convey the souls of the departed to the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_602"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_607">109:1</a> TD has 'those three nights,' referring to the period that the soul is said to remain hovering about the body after death (see Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, ed. Haug, II, 1-18, III, 1-17).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_603"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_608">109:2</a> So in K20; TD has Aû<i>d</i>ak (see Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 70).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_604"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_609">109:3</a> TD has merely 'strikes a slipper (pa<i>d</i>în-pôsh) spiritually,' that is, invisibly, for the purpose of startling the man.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_605"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_610">109:4</a> The short phrases in brackets are taken from TD to supply words torn off from K20, which passes on to Chap. XXIX at this point, but TD supplies a continuation of Chap. XXVIII, which is added here, and enclosed in brackets.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_606"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_611">109:5</a> The Av. Akatasha of Vend. X, 23 Sp., XIX, 43 W.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_607"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_612">109:6</a> See Pahlavi Vend. XVIII, 5, 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_608"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_613">110:1</a> A personification of the Av. zaurva of Vend. XIX, 43 W., Yas. IX, 18 Sp., Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 10, Râm Yt. 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_609"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_614">110:2</a> The reading of this name is uncertain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_610"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_615">110:3</a> The small whirlwinds, which usually precede a change of wind in India, are commonly known by the name of shaîTân, which indicates that such whirling columns of dust are popularly attributed to demoniacal agency.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_611"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_616">110:4</a> A personification of Av. varena, 'desire,' in an evil sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_612"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_617">110:5</a> Av. Bûshyãsta of Vend. XI, 28, 29, 36, 37, XVIII, 38, &amp;c. The names of the three demons in this sentence are Persian words for 'sloth,' 'trouble,' and 'want.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_613"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_618">110:6</a> Av. Âzi of Vend. XVIII, 45, 50, Yas. XVII, 46, LXVII, 22, Â<i>s</i>tâd Yt. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_614"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_619">110:7</a> Compare Pers. payû<i>s</i>, 'covetous,' and piyûs, 'avarice.' Pû<i>s</i> is evidently the demon of misers, and Âz that of the selfish.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_615"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_620">111:1</a> Av. Nasu of Vend, V, 85-106, VI, 65, 72, 74, 79, VII, 2-27, 70, VIII, 46, 48, 132-228, IX, 49-1 7, &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_618"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_623">111:4</a> Av. aghashi of Vend. XX, 14, 20, 24, which appears to be 'the evil eye;' but see § 36.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_619"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_624">111:5</a> Av. Bûiti of Vend. XIX, 4, 6, 140, who must be identified with Pers. but, 'an idol,' Sans. bhûta, 'a goblin,' and not with Buddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_620"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_625">111:6</a> Reading afa<i>s</i> vakhsh pavan bûtîhâ mâhmânŏ, <i>k</i>îgûn bût asp parastê<i>d</i>ŏ, which evidently admits of many variations, but the meaning is rather obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_621"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_626">111:7</a> Here written Astî-vîdâ<i>d</i> (see Chap. III, 21). Vend. V, 25, 31 says, 'Astô-vîdhôtu binds him (the dying, man); Vayô (the flying demon) conveys him bound;' from which it would appear that Astî-vîdâ<i>d</i> and 'the evil flyer' were originally considered as distinct demons.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_622"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_627">112:1</a> Av. Apaosha of Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 21, 22, 27, 28, Â<i>s</i>tâd Yt. 2, 6; see also Chap. VII, 8, 10, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_623"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_628">112:2</a> Here written Aspen<i>g</i>arôgâ, but see Chaps. VII, 12, XVII, 1. He is the Av. Spen<i>g</i>aghra of Vend. XIX, 135, and, being a demon, is not to be confounded with the demon-worshipper, Spi<i>n</i><i>g</i>auru<i>s</i>ka, of Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 31, Ashi Yt. 51.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_624"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_629">112:3</a> The 'evil spirit,' Ganrâk-maînôk, seems to be here treated as a demon distinct from Aharman, which is inconsistent with what is stated in §§ 1-6, and is contrary to general opinion. This inconsistency would indicate the possibility of this continuation of Chap. XXVIII in TD, or a portion of it, having been added by an editor in later times (although it is difficult to discover any difference of style in the language), if we did not find a similar confusion of the two names in Chap. XXX, 29, 30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_625"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_630">113:1</a> Compare Mkh. XL, 24-28: 'The one wish that Hôrmezd, the lord, desires from men is this, that "ye shall understand me (Hôrmezd), since every one who shall understand me comes after me, and strives for my satisfaction." And the one wish that Aharman desires from men is this, that "ye shall not understand me (Aharman), since whoever shall understand me wicked, <i>his</i> actions proceed not after me, and, moreover, no advantage and friendship come to me from that man."'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_626"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_631">113:2</a> The sentence is rather obscure, but it seems to imply that such cries keep the evil spirit at a distance; it is, however, just possible that it means that the cry of the evil spirit can be heard as far as such cries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_627"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_632">113:3</a> Av. Kunda of Vend. XI, 28, 36, XIX, 138.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_628"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_633">113:4</a> TD has Gôk-<i>k</i>ihar and Mû<i>s</i>-parîk here, but see Chap. V, 1, where these beings are included among the seven planetary leaders, and not counted in addition to them. This is another inconsistency which leads to the suspicion that this continuation of the chapter may have been written by a later hand. According to this later view, the sun and moon must be included among those malevolent orbs, the planets.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_629"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_634">114:1</a> Compare Mkh. VII, 31: 'and always their darkness is suchlike as though it be possible to grasp with the hand.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_630"></a><a href="sbe0537.htm#fr_635">114:2</a> Compare Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf-nâmak (LIV, 5-8): '<i>As close</i> as the ear to the eye, and as many as the hairs on the mane of a horse, so <i>close and</i> many in number, the souls of the wicked stand, but they see not, and hear no sound, one from the other; every one thinks thus, "I am alone.".</p>
