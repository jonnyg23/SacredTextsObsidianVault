 <p>On the coming in of Aharman to the creatures it is thus declared in revelation, that <i>in</i> the month Fravar<i>d</i>în <i>and</i> the day Aûharmazd, at noon <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he came forth to the frontier of the sky. 2. The sky sees <i>him</i> and, on account of <i>his</i> nature, fears as much as a sheep trembles at a wolf; <i>and</i> Aharman came on, scorching <i>and</i> burning into it. 3. Then he came to the water which was arranged below the earth <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and darkness without an eyelid was brought on by him; and he came on, through the middle of the earth, as a snake all-leaping comes on out of a hole; and he stayed within the whole earth. 4. The passage where he came on is his own, the way to hell, through which the demons make the wicked run.</p>  
 <p>5. Afterwards, he came to a tree, such as was of a single root, the height of which <i>was</i> several feet, and <i>it was</i> without branches and without bark, juicy <i>and</i> sweet; and to keep the strength of. all kinds of trees in its race, it was in the vicinity of the-middle of the earth; and at the self-same time <i>it became</i> quite withered <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6. Afterwards, he came to the ox, the sole-created <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as it stood as high as Gâyômar<i>d</i> on the</p>

 <p>bank of the water of Dâîtih <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>in</i> the middle of the earth; and its distance from Gâyômar<i>d</i> being as much as its own height, it was also distant from the bank of the water of Dâîtih by the same measure; and it was a female, white <i>and</i> brilliant as the moon. 7. As the adversary came upon <i>it</i> Aûharmazd gave <i>it</i> a narcotic, which is also called 'bang,' to eat, and to rub the 'bang' before the eye <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so that the annoyance from the assault of crimes may be less; it became lean and ill, <i>and</i> fell upon its right breast <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">3</font></a> trembling.</p>  
 <p>8. Before the advance to Gâyômar<i>d</i>, who was then about one-third the height of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> was brilliant as the sun; Aûharmazd forms, from the sweat <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">4</font></a> on the man, a figure of fifteen years, radiant <i>and</i> tall, and sends it on to Gâyômar<i>d</i>; and, he also brings his sweat <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">5</font></a> on to him as long as one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">6</font></a> is <i>being</i> recited. 9. When he issued from the sweat, and raised his eyes, he saw. the world when it was dark as night <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">7</font></a>; on the whole earth were the snake, the scorpion, the lizard (vazak), and noxious creatures of many kinds; <i>and</i> so the other kinds of quadrupeds stood among the</p>

 <p>reptiles; every approach of the whole earth was as though not as much as a needle's point remained, in which there was no rush of noxious creatures. 10. <i>There were</i> the coming of a planetary <i>star</i> into planetary conjunction, and the moon and planets at sixes and sevens <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">1</font></a>; many dark forms with the face and curls of A<i>z</i>-i Dahâk suffered punishment in company with certain non-Iranians; <i>and</i> he was amazed at calling the wicked out from the righteous.</p>  
 <p>11. Lastly, he (Aharman) came up to the fire, and mingled darkness and smoke with it <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_922"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_928">161:4</a> The primeval ox, or first-created representative of animals, as Gâyômar<i>d</i> was of mankind; from which two representatives all mankind and animals are said to have been afterwards developed. There seems to have been some doubt as to the sex of this mythological ox; here it is distinctly stated to have been a female, but from Bund. X, 1, 2, XIV, 3, it would appear to have been a male, and this seems to be admitted by Dâ<i>d</i>-sparam himself, in Chap. IX, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_923"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_929">162:1</a> The Dâîtîk river (see Bund. XX, 13).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_924"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_930">162:2</a> This is a misunderstanding of the corresponding phrase in Bund. III, 18. The narcotic here mentioned is usually prepared from the hemp plant, and is well known in India and the neighbouring countries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_925"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_931">162:3</a> See Bund. IV, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_926"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_932">162:4</a> The word which, as it stands in the MS., looks like hômanâe, is here taken as a transposition of min khvâe, in accordance with Bund. III, 19; but it may be a variant of anumâe, 'embryo,' in which case the translation should be, 'forms an embryo into the shape of a man of fifteen years.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_927"></a><a href="sbe0546.htm#fr_933">162:5</a> Or it may be 'sleep,' both here and in § 9.</p>
