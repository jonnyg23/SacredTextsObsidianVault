 <p>1. As he (Aharman) came fourthly to the plantswhich have struggled (kûkhshî-aîtŏ) against him with the whole vegetationbecause the vegetation <i>was</i> quite dry <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">1</font></a>, Amerôda<i>d</i>, by whom the essence of the world's vegetation <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">2</font></a> was seized upon, pounded it up small, and mixed <i>it</i> up with the rain-water of Tî<i>s</i>tar. 2. After the rain the whole earth is discerned sprouting, and ten thousand <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">3</font></a> special species and a hundred thousand <a name="fr_994"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">4</font></a> additional species (levatman sar<i>d</i>akŏ) so grew as if <i>there were</i> a species of every kind; and those ten thousand species are provided for <a name="fr_995"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">5</font></a> keeping away the ten thousand <a name="fr_996"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">3</font></a> diseases.</p>  
 <p>3. Afterwards, the seed was taken up from those hundred thousand species of plants, <i>and</i> from the collection of seed the tree of all germs, amid the wide-formed ocean, was produced, from which all species of plants continually grow. 4. And the griffon bird (sênô mûrûvŏ) has his resting-place upon it; when he wanders forth <i>from</i> within it, he scatters the dry seed into the water, <i>and</i> it is rained back to the earth with the rain.</p>  
 <p>5. And in its vicinity the tree was produced <i>which is</i> the white Hôm, the counteractor of decrepitude,</p>

 <p>the reviver of the dead, <i>and</i> the immortalizer of the living.</p>  
 <p>6. This was the fourth contest, about the plants.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_985"></a><a href="sbe0552.htm#fr_991">176:1</a> This chapter is a paraphrase of Bund. IX.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_986"></a><a href="sbe0552.htm#fr_992">176:2</a> Or, perhaps, 'the worldly characteristics of vegetation.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_987"></a><a href="sbe0552.htm#fr_996">176:3</a> Written like 'one thousand,' but see the context and Bund. IX, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_988"></a><a href="sbe0552.htm#fr_994">176:4</a> In Bund. IX, 4, the MSS. have '120,000,' which is probably wrong, as Bund. XXVII, 2, agrees with the text above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_989"></a><a href="sbe0552.htm#fr_995">176:5</a> The MS. has barâ instead of pavan, a blunder due probably to some copyist reading the Huzvâri<i>s</i> in Persian, in which language bih (= barâ) and bah (= pavan) are written alike. In Pâzand they are usually written b<i>e</i> and pa, respectively.</p>
