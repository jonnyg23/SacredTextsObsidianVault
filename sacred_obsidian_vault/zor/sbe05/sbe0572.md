 <p>1. The rule is this, that when one's <i>form of</i> worship (ya<i>s</i>t) <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1667"><font size="1">4</font></a> is performed, and it is not possible for him to prepare <i>it</i>, the practice of those of the primitive faith <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1668"><font size="1">5</font></a> is, when the girdle (aîpiyâûng) is twined about a <i>sacred</i> twig-bundle (baresôm) <a name="fr_1681"></a><a href="#fn_1669"><font size="1">6</font></a> of seven twigs (tâk), to consecrate a sacred cake (drônô) thrice, which becomes his <i>form of</i> worship that is performed one degree better through the sacred cake; and of the merit of a threefold <i>consecration</i></p>

 <p><i>of the</i> sacred cake the high-priests <i>have</i> specially taught, in the Hûspâram <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1682"></a><a href="#fn_1670"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that <i>it</i> is as much as <i>that</i> of a lesser <i>form of</i> worship.</p>  
 <p>2. The rule is this, that he who is himself more acquainted with religion is he who considers him who is more acquainted with religion than himself as high-priest, and considers <i>him</i> as high-priest <a name="fr_1683"></a><a href="#fn_1671"><font size="1">2</font></a> so that he may not destroy the bridge of the soul <a name="fr_1684"></a><a href="#fn_1672"><font size="1">3</font></a>; as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1685"></a><a href="#fn_1673"><font size="1">4</font></a> that no one of them, that is an inattentive (asrûshdâr) man who has no high-priest, attains to the best existence <a name="fr_1686"></a><a href="#fn_1674"><font size="1">5</font></a>, not though his recitations should be so many that they have made his duty and good works as much as the verdure (sapdak) of the plants when it shoots forth in spring, the verdure which Aûharmazd <i>has</i> given abundantly.</p>  
 <p>3. The rule is this, that they keep a fire <a name="fr_1687"></a><a href="#fn_1675"><font size="1">6</font></a> in the house, because, from not keeping the fire properly, <i>there</i> arise less pregnancy of women and a weeping (â<i>v</i>-dî<i>d</i>anŏ) for the loss of strength (tanû) of men <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1676"><font size="1">7</font></a>; and the chilled charcoal (angi<i>s</i>t) and the rest which are without advantage (bar) are to be</p>

 <p>carried away from the fire; and in the Spend <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1689"></a><a href="#fn_1677"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>it</i> is revealed that a fire, when they shall make it quite clean from its chilled charcoal, <i>has</i> as much comfort as a man whose clothing they should make clean.</p>  
 <p>4. The rule is this, that when any one passes away it is proper to render useless <a name="fr_1690"></a><a href="#fn_1678"><font size="1">2</font></a> as much as the smallest mouth-veil <a name="fr_1691"></a><a href="#fn_1679"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for it says, in the Vendidad <a name="fr_1692"></a><a href="#fn_1680"><font size="1">4</font></a> that 'if even those Mazdayasnians should leave on him who is dead, in parting with him, as much as that which a damsel would leave in parting with the <i>food</i>-bowl (pa<i>d</i>mânakŏ)that is, a bag (anbânakŏ-hanâ) <a name="fr_1693"></a><a href="#fn_1681"><font size="1">5</font></a>'the decree is this, that <i>it</i> is a Tanâpûhar</p>

 <p>5. The rule is this, that when any one passes away after keeping fasting the three <i>nights</i> <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1685"><font size="1">4</font></a>, still the presentation of holy-water (zôhar) to the fire is to be performed, which is the presenting of the holy-water to the nearest fire; for in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1686"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>it</i> is revealed that when they sever (tebrûnd) the consciousness of men it goes out to the nearest fire, then out to the stars, then out to the</p>

 <p>moon, and then out to the sun <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and <i>it</i> is needful that the nearest fire, which is that to which it <i>has</i> come out, should become stronger (zôr-hômand-tar) <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1688"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6. The rule is this, that they should not leave a nail-<i>paring</i> unprayed over (anâfsû<i>d</i>ak), for if it be not prayed over (afsând) <a name="fr_1701"></a><a href="#fn_1689"><font size="1">3</font></a> it turns into the arms <i>and</i> equipments of the Mâzanân demons <a name="fr_1702"></a><a href="#fn_1690"><font size="1">4</font></a>; <i>this</i> is explicitly shown in the Vendidad <a name="fr_1703"></a><a href="#fn_1691"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. The rule is this, that the labour of child-birth <a name="fr_1704"></a><a href="#fn_1692"><font size="1">6</font></a> is not to be accomplished at night, except while with the light of a fire, or the stars and moon, upon <i>it</i>; for great opposition is connected with it, and in the twentieth of the Hûspâram <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1705"></a><a href="#fn_1693"><font size="1">7</font></a> it is shown <i>that</i> over the soul of him who works in the dark <i>there is</i> more predominance of the evil spirit.</p>  
 <p>8. The rule is this, that they should allow the egg and other food <a name="fr_1706"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">8</font></a> for those gifts <i>and</i> favours of the</p>

 <p>sovereign moon (mâh-i khû<i>d</i>âî) and the other angels; if so, it is to be allowed by them thus: 'I will consecrate so much food for such an angel,' and not thus: 'One sacred cake (drônô) in so much food.' 9. And the reason of it is this, that <i>they</i> who shall allow thus: 'One sacred cake out of so much food,' and of which <i>it</i> is one thing less, even though <i>one</i> shall consecrate <i>it</i> many times, still then he <i>has</i> not repaid; and <i>they</i> who should allow thus: 'I will consecrate so much food for such an angel,' though <i>one</i> shall reverence <i>him</i> with many sacred cakes, it is proper. 10. And in the twenty-two <i>sections</i> of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1707"></a><a href="#fn_1695"><font size="1">1</font></a> grievous things are shown about those who do not make offerings (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>) unto the angels.</p>  
 <p>11. The rule is this, that when a woman becomes pregnant, as long as it is possible, a fire <i>one</i> cares for well is to be maintained in the house, because it is revealed <a name="fr_1708"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the Spend Nask that <i>to</i> Dûkdâv <a name="fr_1709"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when she was pregnant with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, for three nights, every night a leader (shâh) <a name="fr_1710"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">4</font></a> with a hundred and fifty demons came for the destruction of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and yet, owing to the existence of the fire in the dwelling, they knew no means <i>for it</i>.</p>

 <p>12. The rule is this, where a child is born, <i>during</i> three days, for protection from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at night until day<i>light</i>, and is to be maintained there in the day, and pure incense is to be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1711"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>13. The rule is this <a name="fr_1712"></a><a href="#fn_1700"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that from a toothpick the bark <a name="fr_1713"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">3</font></a> is to be well cut off, for there are <i>some</i> of those of the primitive faith <a name="fr_1714"></a><a href="#fn_1702"><font size="1">4</font></a> who <i>have</i> said that, when <a name="fr_1715"></a><a href="#fn_1703"><font size="1">5</font></a> they shall make it for the teeth <i>with</i> the bark on, and they throw <i>it</i> away, a pregnant woman, who puts a foot upon it, is doubtful about <i>its</i> being dead matter.</p>  
 <p>14. The rule is this, that <i>it</i> is well <i>if any one of</i> those who have their handmaid (<i>k</i>akar) in cohabitation (zanîh), and offspring is born of her, shall accept all those who are male as sons; <i>but</i> those who are female are no advantage, because an adopted <i>son</i> (satôr) is requisite, and in the fourteenth of the Hûspâram <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1716"></a><a href="#fn_1704"><font size="1">6</font></a> the high-priests</p>

 <p><i>have</i> taught thus: 'My son is suitable also as thy son, <i>but</i> my daughter is not suitable also as thy daughter;' and <i>there</i> are many who <a name="fr_1717"></a><a href="#fn_1705"><font size="1">1</font></a> do not appoint an adopted <i>son with</i> this idea, that: 'The child of a handmaid may be accepted by us as a son.'</p>  
 <p>15. The rule is this, that <i>one is</i> to persevere much in the begetting of offspring, since <i>it is</i> for the acquisition <a name="fr_1718"></a><a href="#fn_1706"><font size="1">2</font></a> of many good works at once; because in the Spend <a name="fr_1719"></a><a href="#fn_1707"><font size="1">3</font></a> and Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm Nasks <a name="fr_1720"></a><a href="#fn_1708"><font size="1">4</font></a> the high-priests <i>have</i> taught that the duty and good works which a son performs are as much the father's as though they had been done by his own hand; and in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1721"></a><a href="#fn_1709"><font size="1">5</font></a>, it is revealed thus: 'Likewise, too, the good works, <i>in</i> like manner, which come <i>to</i> the father as his own.'</p>  
 <p>18. The rule is this, that what they shall give to the worthy is as much as is proper and beyond, for eating <i>and</i> accumulating; because in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1722"></a><a href="#fn_1710"><font size="1">6</font></a> the high-priests <i>have</i> taught thus: 'When a man gives bread to a man, even though that man <i>has</i> too much bread, all the good works, which he shall perform through that superabundance, become as much his <i>who gave it</i> as though they had been done by his own hand.'</p>

 <p>not to be drawn <a name="fr_1723"></a><a href="#fn_1711"><font size="1">1</font></a> from a well, as in the Bâg-yasnô <a name="fr_1724"></a><a href="#fn_1712"><font size="1">2</font></a> notice is given about the uncleanness (ayo<i>s</i>dâsarîh) of well-water at night.</p>  
 <p>18. The rule is this, that in the night anything eatable is not to be cast away to the north, because a fiend <i>will</i> become pregnant; and when it is cast away one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <a name="fr_1725"></a><a href="#fn_1713"><font size="1">3</font></a> is to be uttered. 19. Those of the primitive faith <a name="fr_1726"></a><a href="#fn_1714"><font size="1">4</font></a> who <i>used</i> to act more orthodoxically (hû-rastakîhâtar), when food <i>was</i> eaten by them in the night, for the sake of preservation from sin owing to the coming of strainings <i>and</i> sprinklings <i>on</i> to the ground, directed a man to chant the Ahunavar <a name="fr_1727"></a><a href="#fn_1715"><font size="1">5</font></a> from the beginning of the feast</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (myazd) unto the end, more especially at the feast of the season-festivals; as it says in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1728"></a><a href="#fn_1716"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavar is that <i>which is</i> most triumphant.</p>  
 <p>20. The rule is this, that when <i>one</i> sees a hedgehog he takes <i>it</i> back to the plain, and its own place is to be preserved free from danger; for in the Vendidad the high-priests <i>have</i> taught, that every day, when the hedgehog voids urine into an ant's nest, a thousand ants will die <a name="fr_1729"></a><a href="#fn_1717"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>21. The rule is this, that some who are of the good religion <i>say</i>, where <i>one</i> is washing <i>his</i> face, one Ashem-vohû <a name="fr_1730"></a><a href="#fn_1718"><font size="1">3</font></a> is always to be uttered, <i>and</i> that Ashem-vohû is to be uttered before the <i>washing</i>; for when he utters <i>it</i> while washing <i>his</i> face, <i>he</i> is doubtful (var-hômand) about the water coming to <i>his</i> mouth.</p>  
 <p>22. The rule is this, that they select from the purifiers <a name="fr_1731"></a><a href="#fn_1719"><font size="1">4</font></a>when their business (mindavam) is as important (rabâ) as purity and impurity<i>him</i> with whom the control <a name="fr_1732"></a><a href="#fn_1720"><font size="1">5</font></a> of ablution (pâ<i>d</i>îyâ<i>v</i>îh) <a name="fr_1733"></a><a href="#fn_1721"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and non-ablution is connected; they select <i>him</i> especially</p>

 <p>with regard to the good disposition and truthful speaking of the man, and <i>to</i> the particular work; and on account of <i>his being</i>, in innocence <i>he</i> is to be considered more righteous. 23. As in the Vendidad <a name="fr_1734"></a><a href="#fn_1722"><font size="1">1</font></a> it says, about the two shares of righteousness, how <i>one</i> should tell that <i>he is</i> 'a righteous man, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! who is a purifier, who should be a speaker that speaks truly, an enquirer of the <i>sacred</i> textsthat is, he has performed his ritual (ya<i>s</i>t)a righteous <i>one</i> who specially understands purification from the religion of the Mazdayasnians, that is, he understands its <i>religious</i> formulas (nîrang).' 24. When <i>it</i> is so that the control of their ablution is connected with him, so that they consider what <i>pertains</i> to the <i>purifying</i> bowl (zak-i tâ<i>s</i>tîk) as his, and ever abstain from it, though the angels hear and consider <i>them</i> as clean, and they select for him those who consecrate the water and bull's urine (gômê<i>z</i>) on account of <i>their</i> control, of purification (yô<i>s</i>dâsarkarîh), <i>and it</i> is to be performed very observantly by the consecrators at the place which is to be measured with a measure and very exactly (khûptar) <a name="fr_1735"></a><a href="#fn_1723"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 25. And the purifier is so much the better when washed again, and when <i>it is</i> by some one through whose periodic (zamânîk)</p>

 <p>care <i>he</i> is thus done; for in the periodic interval many secret <a name="fr_1736"></a><a href="#fn_1724"><font size="1">1</font></a> kinds of pollution are produced. 26. Of the celebrators of the Vendidad the good are <i>they</i> who shall again perform the Navashâ<i>d</i>ar rite <a name="fr_1737"></a><a href="#fn_1725"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for, on account of the same nicety (nâ<i>z</i>ûkîh) which is written above by me, <i>and</i> on account of much also <i>that is</i> secret, which has happened <i>and</i> mostly arises about it, <i>there</i> is no harm from performing <i>it</i>. 27: And <i>any one</i> of those who shall receive the water and bull's urine <i>it</i> is very important to wash beforehand (pavan pê<i>s</i>) <a name="fr_1738"></a><a href="#fn_1726"><font size="1">3</font></a>; because, if <i>there</i> be impurity <i>about</i> him <a name="fr_1739"></a><a href="#fn_1727"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> he puts a hand to the cup (<i>g</i>âmak), the water, <i>and</i> the bull's urine, <i>they</i> are unclean (apâ<i>d</i>â<i>v</i>ŏ) <a name="fr_1740"></a><a href="#fn_1728"><font size="1">5</font></a>; when <i>it is</i> so that <i>there</i> be some one, when so, <i>it</i> is better <i>that</i> they always wash his eyelids (môyak gâs), and to wash them by the clean is good.</p>  
 <p>28. The rule is this, that thou shouldst not consider even any one hopeless (anâîmê<i>d</i>) of heaven,</p>

 <p>and they should not set <i>their</i> minds steadfastly on hell; thereby much sinfulness for which <i>there</i> is a desire would be undesirable, because <i>there</i> is nothing which is a sin <i>in</i> my religion for which <i>there</i> is no retribution, as it says in the Gâthas <a name="fr_1741"></a><a href="#fn_1729"><font size="1">1</font></a> thus:'Of those who are aware that thou art, O Aûharmazd! is even he who is infamous (raspakŏ); and they know the punishment of him even who is very sinful.' 29. And <i>as to</i> him even who is a very sinful person, through the desire <a name="fr_1742"></a><a href="#fn_1730"><font size="1">2</font></a> of good works which is entertained by him, <i>there</i> then comes more fully to him the joy of a soul newly worthy (nuk shâya<i>d</i>); as in the Spend <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1743"></a><a href="#fn_1731"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>it</i> was shown to Zaratû<i>s</i>t about one man, that all <i>his</i> limbs were in torment, and one foot was outside; <i>and</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûharmazd about the reason <i>of it; and</i> Aûharmazd said that he was a man, Davâns <a name="fr_1744"></a><a href="#fn_1732"><font size="1">4</font></a> by name; he was ruler over thirty-three <a name="fr_1745"></a><a href="#fn_1733"><font size="1">5</font></a> districts, and he never practised</p>

 <p>any good work, except one time when fodder <i>was</i> conveyed by him to a sheep with that one foot.</p>  
 <p>30.

The allusion is to the bags used by a menstruous woman, when eating, to prevent contamination of the food. The Persian Rivâyats state that three bags (kîsah) are made of two thicknesses of strong linen, one bag to wear on each hand, and the third, which is larger, to hold the metal food-bowl and water-goblet. After thoroughly washing her hands and face, she puts the two bags on her hands, taking care that they do not touch her food, or clothes, or any other part of her body. She then feeds herself with a metal spoon, which must not touch her nose; and when the meal <a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a> is finished the food-bowl and water-goblet are placed on the large bag, and the two smaller bags inside it, till wanted again.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1683"></a><a href="sbe0572.htm#fr_1695">341:2</a> This passage does not appear to be now extant in the Vendidad, and it is possible to read Nask Dâ<i>d</i> instead of Vadîkdâ<i>d</i>. The Dâ<i>d</i>î or Dâ<i>d</i>ak Nask was the eleventh nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar<i>d</i>, which merely says that its 'Avesta and Zand are not communicated to us by the high-priest.' According to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>, which calls it Khûstô and the Rivâyats, which call it Kha<i>s</i>t, it was the twelfth Nask, and they give its contents in more detail than usual (see Haug's Essays, pp. 130, 131).</p>

IX, 1), renders it possible that it may have been taken from that Nask.</p>

 <p>'The Bakân-yastô is a treatise, first, on the worship (yastô) of Aûharmazd, the most pre-eminent of divinities (bakân a<i>v</i>artûm), and, secondly, the worship of the angels of the other invisible and visible worldly existences, out of whom are even the names of the days, and the glory, power, triumph, and miraculousness of their life also is extreme; the angels who are invoked by name in their worship, and the attention <i>and</i> salutation <i>due</i> to them; the worthiness <i>and</i> dispensation of favour for worshippers, <i>and</i> the business of their many separate recitations unto the angels; the business of unlimited acquaintance with knowledge about the promoters of the treasures of the period, unto whom the creator Aûharmazd <i>is</i> to intrust them, <i>and</i> they remain to cause industry.

II, 6). The place is marked out with furrows in the ground, and furnished with stones (magh) to squat upon during the ablutions (see B. Yt. II. 36). The construction of this paragraph is very obscure in many places, and its proper division into sentences is, therefore, uncertain.</p>
