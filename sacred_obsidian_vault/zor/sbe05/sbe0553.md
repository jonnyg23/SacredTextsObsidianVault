 <p>1. As he (Aharman) came fifthly to cattlewhich struggled against him with all the animalsand likewise as the primeval ox <a name="fr_997"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">1</font></a> passed away, from, the nature of the vegetable principle it possessed, fifty-five <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">2</font></a> species of grain and twelve species of medicinal plants grew from <i>its</i> various members; <i>and</i> forasmuch as they should see from which member each one <i>proceeds</i>, it is declared in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 2. And every plant grown from a member</p>

 <p>promotes that member, as it is said that there <i>where</i> the ox scattered <i>its</i> marrow <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">1</font></a> on to the earth, grain afterwards grew up, corn <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">2</font></a> and sesame, vetches <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_995"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>and</i> peas; so sesame, on account of <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_996"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>its</i> marrow quality, is itself a great thing for developing marrow. 3. And it is also said that from the blood is the vine <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_997"><font size="1">5</font></a>, a great vegetable thingas wine itself is bloodfor more befriending the sound quality of the blood. 4. And it is said that from the nose is the pulse (mây<i>s</i> or mâsah) which is called dônak, and was a variety of sesame (<i>s</i>amagâ) <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_998"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>and it is</i> for other noses.</p>

 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. And it is also said that from the lungs are the rue-like herbs <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_999"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>which</i> heal, and are for the lung-disease of cattle. 6. This, rooted amid the heart, is thyme, from which is Vohûman's thorough withstanding of the stench of Akôman <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_1000"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and <i>it is</i> for that which <i>proceeds</i> from the sick and yawners.</p>  
 <p>7. Afterwards, the brilliance of the seed, seized upon, by strength, from the seed <i>which</i> was the ox's, they would carry <i>off</i> from it, <i>and</i> the brilliance was intrusted to the angel of the moon <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">3</font></a>; in a place therein that seed was thoroughly purified by the light of the moon, and was restored in its many qualities, and made fully infused with life (<i>g</i>ânvar-hômand). 8. Forth from there it produced for Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, first, two oxen, a pair, male and female <a name="fr_1009"></a><a href="#fn_1002"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i>, afterwards, other species, until the completion of the 282 species <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_1003"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and they were discernible as far as two long leagues <i>on</i> the earth. 9. Quadrupeds walked forth on the land, fish swam in the water, <i>and</i> birds flew <i>in</i> the atmosphere; <i>in</i> every two, at the time good eating is enjoyed, a longing (â<i>v</i>dahân) arose therefrom, and pregnancy and birth.</p>  
 <p>10. Secondly, their subdivision is thus:First, they are divided into three, that is, quadrupeds walking on the earth, fish swimming in the water,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>and</i> birds flying in the atmosphere. 11. Then, into five classes <a name="fr_1011"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that is, the quadruped which is round-hoofed, the double-hoofed, the five-clawed, the bird, <i>and</i> the fish, whose dwellings are in five places, <i>and</i> which are called aquatic, burrowing, oviparous, wide-travelling, <i>and</i> suitable for grazing. 12. The aquatic are fish <i>and</i> every beast of burden, cattle, wild beast, dog, <i>and</i> bird which enters the water; the burrowing are the marten (samûr) and musk <i>animals</i>, and all other dwellers and movers in holes; the oviparous are birds of every kind; the wide-travelling sprang away for help, and are also those of a like kind; those suitable for grazing are whatever are kept grazing in a flock.</p>  
 <p>13. And, afterwards, they were divided into genera, as the round-hoofed are one, <i>which</i> is all called 'horse;' the double-hoofed are many, as the camel and ox, the sheep and goat, <i>and</i> others double-hoofed; the five-clawed are the dog, hare, musk <i>animals</i>, marten, <i>and</i> others; then are the birds, and then the fish. 14. And then they were divided into species <a name="fr_1012"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as eight species of horse, two species of camel, ten <a name="fr_1013"></a><a href="#fn_1006"><font size="1">3</font></a> species of ox, five species of sheep, five species of goat, ten of the dog, five of the hare, eight of the marten, eight of the musk <i>animals</i>, 110 of the birds, and ten of the fish; some are counted for the pigs, and with all those declared <i>and</i> all those undeclared <i>there were</i>, at first, 282 species <a name="fr_1014"></a><a href="#fn_1007"><font size="1">4</font></a>; <i>and</i> with the species within species <i>there were</i> a thousand varieties.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. The birds are distributed <a name="fr_1015"></a><a href="#fn_1008"><font size="1">1</font></a> into eight groups (rîstakŏ), and from that which is largest to that which is smallest <i>they</i> are so spread about as <i>when</i> a man, who is sowing grain, first scatters abroad <i>that of</i> heavy weight, then that which is middling, <i>and</i> afterwards that which is small.</p>  
 <p>16. And of the whole of the species, as enumerated a second time in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1016"></a><a href="#fn_1009"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and written by me in the manuscript (nipîk) of 'the summary enumeration of races <a name="fr_1017"></a><a href="#fn_1010"><font size="1">3</font></a>'this is a lordly <a name="fr_1018"></a><a href="#fn_1011"><font size="1">4</font></a> summarythe matter which is shown is, about the species of horses, the first is the Arab, and the chief of them <a name="fr_1019"></a><a href="#fn_1012"><font size="1">5</font></a> is white <i>and</i> yellow-eared, and secondly the Persian, the mule, the ass, the wild ass, the water-horse, <i>and</i> others. 17. Of the camel <i>there are</i> specially two, <i>that for</i> the plain, <i>and</i> the mountain <i>one which</i> is double-humped. 18. Among the species of ox are the white, mud-coloured, red, yellow, black, and dappled, the elk, the buffalo, the camel-leopard <a name="fr_1020"></a><a href="#fn_1013"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the ox-fish, <i>and</i> others. 19. Among sheep are those having tails and those which are tailless, also the wether and the Kûri<i>s</i>k <i>which</i>, because of its trampling the hills, <i>its</i> great horn, and also being suitable</p>

 <p>for ambling, became the steed of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. 20. Among goats are the ass-goat, the Arab, the fawn (varîkŏ), the roe, <i>and</i> the mountain goat. 21. Among martens are the white ermine, the black marten, the squirrel, the beaver (khaz), and others. 22. Of musk <i>animals</i> with a bag, one is the Bîsh-muskwhich eats the Bîsh poison and does not die through it,and it is created for the great advantage that it should eat the Bîsh, <i>and</i> less <i>of it</i> should succeed in poisoning the creatures<i>and</i> one is a musk <i>animal</i> of a black colour which they desired (ayûftŏ) who were bitten <i>by</i> the fanged serpentas the serpent of the mountain water-courses (makŏ) is calledwhich is numerous on the river-banks; <i>one</i> throws the same unto it for food, which it eats, <i>and</i> then the serpent enters its body, when his <a name="fr_1021"></a><a href="#fn_1014"><font size="1">1</font></a> serpent, at the time <i>this</i> happens, feeds upon the same belly in which the serpent is, and he will become clear from that malady. 23. Among birds two were produced of a different character from the rest, and those are the griffon bird <i>and</i> the bat, which have teeth <i>in</i> the mouth, <i>and</i> suckle <i>their</i> young with animal milk from the teat.</p>  
 <p>24. This is the fifth contest, as to animals.</p>

But, according to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkard and the Rivâyats of Kâmah Bahrah, Narîmân Hôshang, and Barzû Qiyâmu-d-dîn, it was the fifth nask, and was called Dvâzdah-hâmâst (or homâst). For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkard, see Haug's Essays, p. 127. The Rivâyat of Kâmah Bahrah, which has a few more words than the other Rivâyats, gives the following account (for the Persian text of which, see 'Fragmens relatifs à la religion de Zoroastre,' par Olshausen et Jules Mohl):</p>  
 <p>'Of the fifth the name is Dvâzdah-homâst, and the interpretation of this is "the book about help" (dar imdâd, but this is probably a corruption of dâmdâd). And this book has thirty-two sections (kardah) that the divine and omnipotent creator sent down, in remembrance of the beginning of the creatures of the superior world and inferior world, and <i>it is</i> a description of the whole of them and of that which God, the most holy and omnipotent, mentioned about the sky, earth, and water, vegetation and <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a> fire, man and quadrupeds, grazing and flying <i>animals</i>, and what he produced for their advantage and use, and the like. Secondly, the resurrection and <i>heavenly</i> path, the gathering and dispersion, and the nature of the circumstances of the resurrection, as regards the virtuous and evil-doers, through the weight of every action they perform for good and evil.'</p>  
 <p>This description corresponds very closely with what the Bundahi<i>s</i> must have been, before the addition of the genealogical and chronological chapters at the end; and Dâ<i>d</i>-sparam mentions in his text here, and again in § 16, particulars regarding the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> which also occur in the Bundahi<i>s</i> (XIV, 2, 14-18, 21-24). There can be very little doubt, therefore, that the Bundahi<i>s</i> was originally a translation of the Dâmdâ<i>d</i>, though probably abridged; and the text translated in this volume is certainly a further abridgment of the original Bundahi<i>s</i>, or Zand-âkâs. Whether the Avesta text of the Dâmdâd was still in existence in the time of Dâ<i>d</i>-sparam is uncertain, as he would apply the name to the Pahlavi text. At the present time it is very unusual for a copyist to write the Pahlavi text without its Avesta, when the latter exists, but this may not always have been the case.</p>
