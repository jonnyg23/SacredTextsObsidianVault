 <p><a name="fn_1033"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1040">191:1</a> Or, possibly, '<i>for</i> whom I am written,' the meaning of mûn yektîbûnîhêm being not quite clear. In fact, the construction of the whole of this initial benediction is rather obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1034"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1041">191:2</a> It is possible that this is to be read in connection with Chap. II, 1, with the meaning that 'as it is declared by the Stû<i>d</i>gar <i>Nask</i> that Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked for immortality from Aûharmazd, <i>so</i> in the Vohûman Ya<i>s</i>t commentary it is declared that he asked for it a second time.' This introductory chapter is altogether omitted in both the Pâz. MSS. which have been examined, but it is given in the Pers. version. It is also omitted in the epitome of the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t contained in the Dabistân (see Shea's translation, vol. i. pp. 264-271).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1035"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1042">191:3</a> This was the first nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar<i>d</i>, which calls it Sû<i>d</i>kar; but according to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i> and the Rivâyats it was the second nask, called Stûdgar or Istûdgar. For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i> (which agrees with the account in the Rivâyats), see Haug's Essays, p. 126. In the Dînkar<i>d</i>, besides a short description of this Nask, given in the eighth book, there is also a detailed account of the contents of each of its fargar<i>d</i>s, or chapters, occupying twenty-five quarto pages of twenty-two lines each, in the ninth book. From this detailed statement it appears <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a> that the passage mentioned here, in the text, constituted the seventh fargar<i>d</i> of the Nask, the contents of which are detailed as follows:</p>  
 <p>'The seventh fargar<i>d</i>, Tâ-ve-ratŏ (Av. tâ v<i>e</i> urvâtâ, Vas. XXXI, 1), is about the exhibition to Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the nature of the four periods in the Zaratû<i>s</i>tian millennium (hazangrôk zim, "thousand winters"). First, the golden, that in which Aûharmazd displayed the religion to Zaratû<i>s</i>t. Second, the silver, that in which Vi<i>s</i>tâsp received the religion from Zaratû<i>s</i>t. Third, the steel, the period within which the organizer of righteousness, Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Mârspend, was born. Fourth, the period mingled with iron is this, in which is much propagation of the authority of the apostate <i>and</i> other villains (sarîtarânŏ), along with destruction of the reign of religion, the weakening of every kind of goodness <i>and</i> virtue, <i>and</i> the departure of honour <i>and</i> wisdom from the countries of Iran. In the same period is a recital of the many perplexities and torments of the period for that desire (girâyîh) of the life of the good which consists in seemliness. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness (Av. ashem vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem astî, Yas. XXVII. 14, W.).'</p>  
 <p>If this be a correct account of the contents of this fargar<i>d</i>, the writer was evidently consulting a Pahlavi version of the Nask, composed during the later Sasanian times.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1036"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1043">192:1</a> Generally understood to mean 'descendant of Spitama,' who was his ancestor in the ninth generation (see Bund. XXXII, 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1037"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1044">193:1</a> A word is lost here in K20 and does not occur in the other copies and versions, nor can it be supplied from the similar phrase in Chap. II, 16. The meaning of the sentence appears to be that Vi<i>s</i>tâsp destroyed the idols, but the demons they represented still remained, in a spiritual state, to produce evil.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1038"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1045">193:2</a> See, Chap. II, 17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1039"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1046">193:3</a> Khusrô Nôshirvân son of Qubâd, in modern Persian, who reigned in A.D. 531-579. Kêvâ<i>d</i> is usually written Kavâ<i>d</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1040"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1047">193:4</a> The epithet vi<i>g</i>âr<i>d</i>-vars may also mean 'dressed-hair,' but the term in the text is the more probable, as the Persian version translates it by kushâdah muî, 'uncovered hair.' That it is not a name, as assumed by Spiegel, appears clearly from the further details given in Chap. II, 25.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1041"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1048">193:5</a> Or, 'the progeny of Aêshm,' the demon. Wrath is not to be understood here in its abstract sense, but is personified as a demon. It is uncertain whether the remainder of this sentence belongs to this § or the next.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1042"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1049">193:6</a> If there were any doubt about zand meaning the Pahlavi translation, this passage would be important, as the Avesta of the Horvada<i>d</i> (Khordâd) and Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i> Ya<i>s</i>ts is still extant, but contains nothing about the heretic Mazdîk or Mazdak (see Chap. II, 21). No Avesta of the Vohûman Ya<i>s</i>t is now known.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1043"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1050">194:1</a> That is, Khusrô Nôshirvân. As the names of his priests and councillors stand in K20 they can hardly be otherwise distributed than they are in the text, but the correctness of the Ms. is open to suspicion. Dâ<i>d</i>-Aûharmazd was a commentator who is quoted in Chap. III, 16, and in the Pahl. Yas. XI, 22; Âtarô-frôbâg was another commentator mentioned in Sls. I, 3; and Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> and Bakht-âfrî<i>d</i> are names well known in Pahlavi literature, the former having been borne by more than one individual (see Sls. I, 3, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1044"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1051">194:2</a> The Pers. version says nothing about this promise, but states that Khûsrô sent a message to the accursed Mazdak, requiring him to reply to the questions of this priestly assembly on pain of death, to which he assented, and he was asked ten religious questions, but was unable to answer one so the king put him to death immediately.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1045"></a><a href="sbe0557.htm#fr_1052">194:3</a> A similar prohibition, addressed to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, as regards the Avesta text, is actually found in the Horvada<i>d</i> Yt. 10.</p>
