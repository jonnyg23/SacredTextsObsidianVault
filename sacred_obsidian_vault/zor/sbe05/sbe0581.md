 <p><a name="fn_1939"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1951">397:3</a> The contents of this chapter, regarding the lengths of midday and afternoon shadows, immediately follow a tale of Gô<i>s</i>t-i Fryânô, which is appended to the book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf's journey to the other world, both in M6 and K20. As will be seen from the notes, these details about shadows were probably compiled at Yazd in Persia, as they are suitable only for that latitude.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1940"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1952">397:4</a> Reading âya<i>d</i>-ae (a very rare form), or it may be intended for hômanâe, 'should it be,' but it is written in both MSS. exactly like the two ciphers for the numeral 5. Mullâ Fîrûz in his Avî<i>g</i>eh Dîn, p. 279 seq., takes 5 khadûk pâî as implying that the shadow is under the sole of the foot, or the sun overhead; but neither this reading, nor the more literal 'one-fifth of a foot,' can be reconciled with the other measures; though if we take 5 as standing for pan<i>g</i>ak, 'the five <i>toes</i> or sole,' we might translate as follows: '<i>When</i> the sun is at Cancer, <i>the shadow</i> is the sole of one foot of the man.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1941"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1953">398:1</a> K20 has 'three' by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1942"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1954">398:2</a> M6 omits 'and a half' by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1943"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1955">398:3</a> K20 has 'six' by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1944"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1956">398:4</a> Both MSS. omit one cipher, and have only 'six,' but the shadow must be the same here as at the fifteenth of Sagittarius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1945"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1957">398:5</a> Both MSS. have 'seven,' which is clearly wrong.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1946"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1958">398:6</a> It is obvious that, as the length of a man's shadow depends upon the height of the sun, each of these observations of his noonday shadow determines the altitude of the sun at noon, and is, therefore, a rude observation for finding the latitude of the place, provided we know the ratio of a man's foot to his stature. According to Bund. XXVI, 3 a man's stature is eight spans (vitast), and according to Farh. Okh. p. 41 a vitast is twelve finger-breadths, and a foot is fourteen (see Bund. XXVI, 3, note), so that a man's stature of eight spans is equivalent to 6 6/7 feet. Assuming this to have been the ratio adopted by the Observer, supposing the obliquity of the ecliptic to have been 23° 35´ (as it <a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 399</font></a> was about A.D. 1000), and calculating the latitude from each of the thirteen different lengths of shadow, the mean result is 32° 1´ north latitude, which is precisely the position assigned to Yazd (the head-quarters of the small remnant of Zoroastrians in Persia) on some English maps, though some foreign maps place it 15´ or 20´ farther south. With regard to the rough nature of this mode of observation it may be remarked that, as the lengths of the shadows are noted only to half a foot, there is a possible error of a quarter-foot in any of them; this would produce a possible error of 2° 4´ in the midsummer observation of latitude, and of 39´ in the midwinter one; or a mean possible error of 1° 22´ in any of the observations; so that the possible error in the mean of thirteen observations is probably not more than 6´, and the probable error is even less, provided the data have been assumed correctly.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1947"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1959">399:1</a> Reading nipi<i>s</i>t, but only the first and last letters are legible in M6, and the middle letter is omitted in K20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1948"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1960">399:2</a> See Bund. XXV, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1949"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1961">399:3</a> The word sar, 'head,' usually means 'the end,' but it must be here taken as 'the beginning;' perhaps, because the zodiacal signs are supposed to come head-foremost.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1950"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1962">399:4</a> What portion of a foot is meant by bâhar, 'part,' is doubtful. It can hardly be a quarter, because 'two quarters' would be too clumsy a term for 'a half.' But it appears from § 5-7 that the shadow, necessary to constitute the Aûzêrîn period, is taken as increasing uniformly from six feet and two parts to fourteen feet and two parts, an increase of eight feet in six months, or exactly one foot and one-third per month, as stated in the text. And, deducting this monthly increase of one feet and one-third from the seven and a half feet shadow at the end of the first month, we have six feet and one-sixth remaining for the shadow at the <a name="page_400"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 400</font></a> beginning of the month. Hence we may conclude that the 'two parts' are equal to one-sixth, and each 'part' is one-twelfth of a foot.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1951"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1963">400:1</a> Meaning that the increase of shadow is to be taken into account as soon as it amounts to half a foot, that is, about every ten days. Practically, half a foot would be added on the tenth and twentieth days, and the remaining one-third of a foot at the end of the month.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1952"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1964">400:2</a> Both MSS. have 'eight,' but this would be inconsistent with the context, as it is impossible that 'six feet and two parts' can become 'eight feet and a half' by the addition of 'one foot and one-third,' whatever may be the value of the 'two parts' of a foot.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1953"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1965">400:3</a> Both MSS. have 3 yak-1 pâî, instead of pâî 3 yak-1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1954"></a><a href="sbe0581.htm#fr_1966">400:4</a> This mode of determining the beginning of the afternoon period is not so clumsy as it appears, as it keeps the length of that period exceedingly uniform for the six winter months with some increase in the summer time. In latitude 32° north, where the longest day is about 13 hours 56 minutes, and the shortest is 10 hours 4 minutes, these observations of a man's shadow make the afternoon period begin about 3¾ hours before sunset at mid-summer, <a name="page_401"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 401</font></a> diminishing to 2¾ hours at the autumnal equinox, and then remaining very nearly constant till the vernal equinox.</p>
