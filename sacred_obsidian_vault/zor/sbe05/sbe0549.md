 <p>When in like manner, and equally oppressively, as his (Aûharmazd's) creatures were disfigured, then through that same deterioration his own great glory was exhibited; for as he came within the sky <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">1</font></a> he maintains the spirit of the sky, like an intrepid warrior who has put on metal armour <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and the sky in its fortress <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">3</font></a> spoke these hasty, deceitful words to Aharman, thus: 'Now when thou shalt have come in I <i>will</i> not let thee back;' <i>and</i> it obstructed <i>him</i> until Aûharmazd prepared another rampart, that is stronger, around the sky, <i>which</i> is called 'righteous understanding' (ashôk âkâsîh). 2. And he arranged the guardian spirits <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the righteous who are warriors around that rampart, mounted on horses and spear in hand, in such manner as the hair on the head; and they acquired the appearance of prison guards who watch a prison from outside, and would not surrender the outer boundaries <i>to</i> an enemy descended from the inside.</p>  
 <p>3. Immediately, Aharman endeavours that he may go back to his own complete darkness, but he found no passage; and he recapitulated, with seeming misgiving, his fears of the worthiness which is to arise at the appearance of the renovation <i>of the universe</i> at the end of the nine thousand years.</p>  
 <p>4. As it is said in the Gâthas, thus <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">5</font></a>: 'So also</p>

 <p>both those spirits have approached together unto that which was the first creationthat is, both spirits have come to the body of Gâyômar<i>d</i>. Whatever is in life <i>is so</i> through this purpose of Aûharmazd, that is: So that I may keep it alive; whatever is in lifelessness <i>is so</i> through this purpose <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the evil spirit, that is: So that I may utterly destroy it; and whatever is thus, is so until the last in the world, so that they (both spirits) come also on to the rest of mankind. And on account of the utter depravity of the wicked <i>their</i> destruction is fully seen, <i>and</i> so is the perfect meditation of him who is righteous, the hope of the eternity of Aûharmazd.'</p>  
 <p>5. And this was the first contest <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>that of</i> the sky with Aharman.</p>
