 <p align="center">0. On the conflict which the evil spirit waged with the earth.</p>  
 <p>1. As the evil spirit rushed in, the earth shook <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> the substance of mountains was created in the earth. 2. First, Mount Albûr<i>z</i> arose; afterwards,</p>

 <p>the other ranges of mountains (kôfânîhâ) of the middle of the earth; for as Albûr<i>z</i> grew forth all the mountains remained in motion, for they have all grown forth from the root of Albûr<i>z</i>. 3. At that time they came up from the earth, like a tree which <i>has</i> grown up to the clouds <i>and its</i> root <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the bottom; and their root passed on that way <i>from</i> one to the other, <i>and</i> they are arranged in mutual connection. 4. Afterwards, about that wonderful shaking out from the earth, they say that a great mountain is the knot of lands; <i>and</i> the passage for the waters within the mountains is the root which is below the mountains; they forsake the upper <i>parts</i> so that they may flow into it, just as the roots of trees pass into the earth; a counterpart (ângunî-aîtak) of the blood in the arteries of men, which gives strength to the whole body. 5. In numbers <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">2</font></a>, apart from Albûr<i>z</i>, all the mountains grew up out of the earth in eighteen years <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">3</font></a>, from which <i>arises</i> the perfection <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">4</font></a> of men's advantage.</p>
