 <p>1. <i>In</i> one place it is declared that it is said by revelation (dînô) that a man is to go as much as possible (<i>k</i>and vê<i>s</i>-ast) to the abode of fires <a name="fr_1937"></a><a href="#fn_1925"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the salutation (nîyâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) of fire <a name="fr_1938"></a><a href="#fn_1926"><font size="1">4</font></a> is to be performed <i>with</i> reverence; because three times every day the archangels form an assembly in the abode of fires, and shed good works and righteousness there; and then the good works and righteousness, which are shed there, become more lodged in the body of <i>him</i> who goes much thither, and performs many salutations of fire <i>with</i> reverence.</p>

 <p>2. This, too, that the nature of wisdom is just like fire; for, in this world, <i>there</i> is nothing which shall become so complete as that thing which is made with wisdom; and every fire, too, that they kindle and <i>one</i> sees from far, makes manifest <i>what is</i> safe and uninjured (aîrâkht); whatever is safe in fire is safe for ever, and whatever is uninjured in fire is uninjured for ever.</p>  
 <p>3. This, too, that a disposition in which is no wisdom is such-like as a clear, unsullied (anâhûk) fountain which is choked (bastŏ) and never goes into use; and the disposition with which <i>there</i> is wisdom is such-like as a clear, unsullied fountain, over which an industrious man stands <i>and</i> takes <i>it</i> into use; cultivation restrains <i>it</i>, and it gives crops (bar) to the world.</p>  
 <p>4. This, too, that these three things are to be done by men, to force the <i>demon of</i> corruption (nasû<i>s</i>) <a name="fr_1939"></a><a href="#fn_1927"><font size="1">1</font></a> far away from the body, to be steadfast in the religion, and to perform good works. 5. To force the <i>demon of</i> corruption far away from the body is this, that before the sun <i>has</i> come up <i>one</i> is to wash the hands <a name="fr_1940"></a><a href="#fn_1928"><font size="1">2</font></a> and face with bull's urine and water; to be steadfast in the religion is this, that <i>one</i> is to reverence the sun <a name="fr_1941"></a><a href="#fn_1929"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and to perform good works is this, that <i>one</i> is to destroy several noxious creatures.</p>  
 <p>6. This, too, that the three greatest concerns of men are these, to make him who is an enemy a friend, to make him who is wicked righteous, and to make him who is ignorant learned. 7. To make</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 395</font></a></p>  
 <p>an enemy a friend is this, that out of the worldly wealth <i>one</i> has before him he keeps a friend in mind; to make a wicked <i>one</i> righteous is this, that from the sin, whereby he becomes wicked, <i>one</i> turns him away; and to make an ignorant <i>one</i> learned is this, that <i>one</i> is to manage himself so that he who is ignorant may learn of him.</p>  
 <p>8. This, too, <i>that</i> the walks of men are to be directed chiefly to these three places, to the abode of the well-informed, to the abode of the good, <i>and</i> to the abode of fires <a name="fr_1942"></a><a href="#fn_1930"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 9. To the abode of the well-informed, that so <i>one</i> may become wiser, and religion be more lodged in <i>one's</i> person; to the abode of the good for this <i>reason</i>, that so, among good and evil, he may thereby renounce the evil and carry home <i>the good</i> <a name="fr_1943"></a><a href="#fn_1931"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and to the abode of fires for this <i>reason</i>, that so the spiritual fiend may turn away from him.</p>  
 <p>10. This, too, that <i>he</i> whose actions are for the soul, the world is then his own, and the spiritual <i>existence</i> more his own; and <i>he</i> whose actions are for the body, the spiritual <i>existence</i> has <i>him</i> at pleasure, <i>and</i> they snatch the world from him compulsorily.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, that Bakht-âfrî<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1944"></a><a href="#fn_1932"><font size="1">3</font></a> said, that every Gâtha (gâsân) <a name="fr_1945"></a><a href="#fn_1933"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Aûharmazd has been an opposition</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 396</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the one adversary, and the renunciation <i>of sin</i> (patîtîk) <a name="fr_1946"></a><a href="#fn_1934"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the opposition of every fiend.</p>  
 <p>12. This, too, that, regarding the world, anxiety is not to be suffered, it is not to be considered as anything whatever, and is not to be let slip from the hand. 13. Anxiety is not to be suffered for this <i>reason</i>, because that which is ordained will happen; it is not to be considered as anything whatever for this <i>reason</i>, because should it be expedient it is necessary to abandon <i>it</i>; and it is not to be let slip from the hand for this <i>reason</i>, because it is proper, in the world, to provide a spiritual <i>existence</i> for oneself.</p>  
 <p>14. This, too, that the best thing is truth, and the worst thing is deceit; and <i>there</i> is <i>he</i> who speaks true <i>and</i> thereby becomes wicked, and <i>there</i> is <i>he</i> who speaks false <i>and</i> thereby becomes righteous.</p>  
 <p>15. This, too, that fire is not to be extinguished <a name="fr_1947"></a><a href="#fn_1935"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for <i>this</i> is a sin; and <i>there</i> is <i>he</i> who extinguishes <i>it, and</i> is good.</p>  
 <p>16. This, too, is declared, that nothing is to be given to the vile; and <i>there</i> is <i>he by</i> whom the best and most pleasant ragout (khûr<i>d</i>îk) is to be given to the vile.</p>  
 <p>17. On these, too, is the attention of men <i>to be fixed</i>, because <i>there</i> is a remedy for everything but death, a hope for everything but wickedness, everything will lapse <a name="fr_1948"></a><a href="#fn_1936"><font size="1">3</font></a> except righteousness, it is possible</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 397</font></a></p>  
 <p>to manage everything but temper (gôhar), and it is possible <i>for</i> everything to change but divine providence (bakô-bakhtô).</p>  
 <p>18. This, too, is declared, that Frê<i>d</i>ûn <a name="fr_1949"></a><a href="#fn_1937"><font size="1">1</font></a> wished to slay A<i>z</i>-i Dahâk <a name="fr_1950"></a><a href="#fn_1938"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>but</i> Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'Do not slay <i>him</i> now, for the earth will become full of noxious creatures.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1924"></a><a href="sbe0580.htm#fr_1936">393:2</a> The contents of this chapter conclude the MS. M6; a few lines even having been lost at the end of that MS., though preserved in some of its older copies. A more modern copy, in the MS. No. 121 of the Ouseley collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, contains §§ 4-17, appended to the Bundahi<i>s</i>. Complete Pâzand versions, derived from M6, occur in L7 and L22, immediately following the Pâzand of Chap. XVIII.</p>
