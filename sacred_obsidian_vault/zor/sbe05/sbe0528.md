 <p>1. Regarding the three-legged a ass <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">4</font></a> they say, that it stands amid the wide-formed ocean, and its feet are three, eyes six, mouths <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">5</font></a> nine, ears two, and horn</p>  
 <p>

 <p>one, body white, food spiritual, <i>and</i> it is righteous. 2. And two of its six eyes are in the position of eyes, two on the; top of the head, and two in the position of the hump <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">1</font></a>; with the sharpness of those six eyes it overcomes <i>and</i> destroys. 3. Of the nine mouths three are in the head, three in the hump, and three in the inner part of the flanks; and each mouth is about the size of a cottage, and <i>it is</i> itself as large as Mount Alvand <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 4. Each one of the three feet, when it is placed on the ground, is as much as a flock (gir<i>d</i>) of a thousand sheep comes under when they repose together; <i>and</i> each pastern <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">3</font></a> is so great in its circuit that a thousand men with a thousand horses may pass inside. 5. As for the two ears <i>it is</i> Mâzendarân which they will encompass. 6. The one horn is as it were of gold <i>and</i> hollow, and a thousand <i>branch</i> horns <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">4</font></a> have grown upon it, some befitting <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">5</font></a> a camel, some befitting a horse, some befitting an ox, some befitting an ass, both great and small. 7. With that horn it will vanquish <i>and</i> dissipate all the vile corruption <i>due to</i> the efforts of noxious creatures.</p>

 <p>8. When that ass shall hold <i>its</i> neck in the ocean <i>its</i> ears will terrify (asahmê<i>d</i>), <i>and</i> all the water of the wide-formed ocean will shake with agitation, <i>and</i> the side of Ganâva<i>d</i> <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a> will tremble (shîvanê<i>d</i>). 9. When it utters a cry all female water-creatures, of the creatures of Aûharmazd, will become pregnant; and all pregnant noxious water-creatures, when they hear that cry, will cast <i>their</i> young. 10. When it stales in the ocean all the sea-water will become purified, which is in the seven regions of the earth<i>it is</i> even on that account when all asses which come into water stale in the wateras it says thus: 'If, O three-legged ass! you were not created for the water, all the water in the sea would have perished from the contamination which the poison of the evil spirit has brought into its water, through the death of the creatures of Aûharmazd.'</p>  
 <p>11. Tî<i>s</i>tar seizes the water <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a> more completely from the ocean with the assistance of the three-legged ass. 12. Of ambergris also (ambar-i<i>k</i>) <i>it</i> is declared, that it is the dung of the three-legged ass; for if it has much spirit food, then also the moisture of the liquid nourishment goes through the veins <i>pertaining</i> to the body into the urine, <i>and</i> the dung is cast away.</p>  
 <p>13. Of the ox Hadhayô<i>s</i> <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which they call Sarsaok <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">4</font></a>, it says, that in the original creation men passed from region to region <i>upon it, and</i> in the</p>

 <p>renovation <i>of the universe</i> they prepare Hûsh (the beverage producing immortality) from it. 14. It is said, that life is in the hand of that foremost man, at the end of <i>his</i> years <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who has constructed the most defences around this earth, until the renovation <i>of the universe</i> is requisite.</p>  
 <p>15. Regarding the bird <i>K</i>âmrô<i>s</i> <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">2</font></a> it says, that <i>it is</i> on the summit of Mount Albûr<i>z</i>; <i>and</i> every three years many come from the non-Iranian districts for booty (gir<i>d</i>) <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">3</font></a>, by going to bring damage (zîyân) on the Iranian districts, and to effect the devastation of the world; then the angel Bûr<i>g</i> <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>having</i> come up from the low country of Lake Arag <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">5</font></a>, arouses that very bird <i>K</i>âmrô<i>s</i>, <i>and</i> it flies upon the loftiest of all the lofty mountains, <i>and</i> picks up all those non-Iranian districts as a bird <i>does</i> corn.</p>  
 <p>16. Regarding Kar<i>s</i>ipt <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">6</font></a> they say, that it knew how to speak words, <i>and</i> brought the religion to the enclosure which Yim made, and circulated <i>it</i>; there they utter the Avesta in the language of birds.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Regarding the ox-fish they say, that it exists in all seas; when it utters a cry all fish become pregnant, and all noxious water-creatures cast <i>their</i> young.</p>  
 <p>18. The griffon bird <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which is a bat, is noticed (kar<i>d</i>) twice in another chapter (babâ).</p>  
 <p>19. Regarding the bird Ashôzu<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">2</font></a>, which is the bird Zobara <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">3</font></a>-vahman <i>and</i> also the bird <i>S</i>ôk <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">4</font></a>, they say that it has given an Avesta with <i>its</i> tongue; when it speaks the demons tremble at it <i>and</i> take nothing away there; a nail-<i>paring</i>, when it is not prayed over (afsû<i>d</i>), the demons <i>and</i> wizards seize, <i>and</i> like an arrow it shoots at <i>and</i> kills that bird. 20. On this account the bird seizes <i>and</i> devours a nail-<i>paring</i>, when it is prayed over, so that the demons may not control <i>its</i> use; when it is not prayed over it does not devour <i>it, and</i> the demons are able to commit an offence with it.</p>  
 <p>21. Also other beasts and birds are created all in opposition to noxious creatures, as it says, that when the birds <i>and</i> beasts are all in opposition to noxious creatures and wizards, <i>&amp;c.</i> <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">5</font></a> 22. This, too, it says, that of all precious <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">6</font></a> birds the crow (valâgh) is the most precious. 23, Regarding the white falcon it</p>

 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a></p>  
 <p>says, that it kills the serpent with wings. 24. The magpie (kâskînak) bird kills the locust, <i>and</i> is created in opposition to it. 25. The Kahrkâs <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">1</font></a>, dwelling in decay, which is the vulture, is created for devouring dead matter (nasâî); so also are the crow (valâk) <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the mountain kite.</p>  
 <p>26. The mountain ox, the mountain goat, the deer, the wild ass, <i>and</i> other beasts devour all snakes. 27. So also, of other <i>animals</i>, dogs are created in opposition to the wolf species, <i>and</i> for securing the protection of sheep; the fox is created in opposition to the demon Khava; the ichneumon is created in opposition to the venomous snake (gar<i>z</i>ak) <i>and</i> other noxious creatures in burrows; so also the great musk-<i>animal</i> is created in opposition <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">3</font></a> to ravenous intestinal worms (ka<i>d</i>ûk-dânak gar<i>z</i>ak). 28. The hedgehog is created in opposition to the ant which carries off grain <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as it says, that the hedgehog, every time that it voids urine into an ant's nest, will destroy a thousand ants; when the grain-carrier travels over the earth it produces</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>a hollow track <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">1</font></a>; when the hedgehog travels over it the track goes away from it, and it becomes level. 29. The water-beaver is created in opposition to the demon which is in the water. 30. The conclusion is this, that, of all beasts and birds and fishes, every one is created in opposition to some noxious creature.</p>  
 <p>31. Regarding the vulture (karkâs) it says, that, even from his highest flight, he sees when flesh the size of a fist is on the ground; and the scent of musk is created under his wing, so that if, in devouring dead matter, the stench of the dead matter comes <i>out</i> from it, he puts <i>his</i> head back under the wing <i>and</i> is comfortable again. 32. Regarding the Arab horse they say, that if, in a dark night, a single hair occurs on the ground, he sees <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>33. The cock is created in opposition to demons <i>and</i> wizards, co-operating with the dog; as it says in revelation, that, of the creatures of the world, those which are co-operating with Srôsh <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in destroying the fiends, are the cock and the dog. 34. This, too, it says, that it would not have <i>been</i> managed if I had not created the shepherd's dog, which is the Pasu<i>s</i>-haurva <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> the house watchdog, the Vi<i>s</i>-haurva <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for it says in revelation, that the dog is a destroyer of such a fiend as covetousness,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>among those which are in the nature (aîtîh) of man and of animals. 35. Moreover it says, that, inasmuch as it will destroy all the disobedient, when it barks it will destroy pain <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and its flesh and fat are remedies for driving away decay and pain from men <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>36. Aûharmazd created nothing useless whatever, for all these (kolâ aê) are created for advantage; when one does not understand the reason of them, it is necessary to ask the Dastûr ('high-priest'), for his five dispositions (khûk) <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">3</font></a> are created in this way that he may continually destroy the fiend (or deceit).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_343"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_345">67:4</a> The Av. khara, 'which is righteous <i>and</i> which stands in the middle of the wide-shored ocean' (Yas. XLI, 28). Darmesteter, in his Ormazd et Ahriman (pp. 148-151), considers this mythological monster as a meteorological myth, a personification of clouds and storm; and, no doubt, a vivid imagination may trace a striking resemblance between some of the monster's attributes and certain fanciful ideas regarding the phenomena of nature; the difficulty is to account for the remaining attributes, and to be sure that these fanciful ideas were really held by Mazdayasnians of old. Another plausible view is to consider such mythological beings as foreign gods tolerated by the priesthood, from politic motives, as objects worthy of reverence; even as the goddess Anâhita was tolerated in the form of the angel of water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_344"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_346">67:5</a> This is the traditional meaning of the word, which (if this <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> meaning be correct) ought probably to be read yông, and be traced to Av. <i>e</i>e<i>a</i>ungh (Yas.

 <p><a name="fn_358"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_360">70:5</a> Or, 'of the district of Arag' (see the note on Chap. XII, 23). Although no Lake Arag is described in Chap. XXII, some of the epithets referring to its Avesta equivalent Rangha are more applicable to a lake than to a river, as in Bahrâm Yt. 29. Possibly the low lands between the Caspian and Aral, or on the shores of the Caspian, are meant.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_365"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_367">71:6</a> The Pahlavi word is ambiguous; it may be read zîl, 'cheap, common,' or it may be zagar = yakar, 'dear, precious,' but the <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a> latter seems most probable, although the crow is perhaps as 'common' as it is 'precious,' as a scavenger in the East. Singularly enough Pers. arzân is a synonym to both words, as it means both 'cheap' and 'worthy.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_366"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_368">72:1</a> The Av. kahrkâsa of Vend. III, 66, IX, 181, Âbân Yt. 61, Mihir Yt. 129; its epithet zarmân-mâni<i>s</i>n, 'dwelling in decay,' is evidently intended as a translation of the Av. zarenumaini<i>s</i>, applied to it in Bahrâm Yt. 33, Dîn Yt. 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_367"></a><a href="sbe0528.htm#fr_369">72:2</a> The text should probably be valâk-i sîyâk va sâr-i gar, 'the black crow and the mountain kite,' which are given as different birds in Shâyast-lâ-shâyast, II, 5.</p>
