 <p><font size="-1">Gô<i>s</i>, 'the cow,' κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, is a personation of the animal kingdom which she maintains and protects. She is also called Drvâspa and Go<i>s</i>ûrûn: Drvâspa means 'she who keeps horses in health,' and is nothing more than an epithet of Gô<i>s</i>: Gô<i>s</i>ûrûn (from the Zend G<i>e</i>u<i>s</i> urvan) means 'the Soul of the Bull' (the primeval Bull). Although urvan is a masculine noun in Zend, yet Gô<i>s</i>ûrûn is considered a female angel, as this name is only a substitute for Gô<i>s</i>.</font></p>  
 <p>Gô<i>s</i> is the angel of the 14th day (Sîrôzah I, 14), and her Ya<i>s</i>t is recited during the Gâh U<i>s</i>ahin, on the days of Gô<i>s</i>, Bahman, Mâh, and Râm (the same days as those on which the Mâh Ya<i>s</i>t is recited; see above, <a href="sbe2312.htm#page_88">p. 88</a>).</p>  
 <p>Gô<i>s</i> is hardly described in this Ya<i>s</i>t (§§ 1-2); the greater part of it being filled with the several prayers addressed to her by the Iranian heroes, Haoshyangha (§ 3), Yima (§ 8), Thraêtaona (§ 13), Haoma (§ 17), Husravah (§ 21), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and Vî<i>s</i>tâspa. Her worshippers and their prayers to her are the same as in the case of Ashi Vanguhi (see Yt. XVII).</p>

Marcellinus XVII, 5). The name of the Varedhakas reminds one of the Vertae who are mentioned once in company with the Chionitae (ibid. XIX, 1); but their geographical situation is not ascertained. In any case the proximity of the Dâitya (§ 29) shows that both people must have inhabited the western coast of the Caspian sea.</p>
