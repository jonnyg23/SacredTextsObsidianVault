But at last his wife, deceived by Ahriman, revealed to him the secret of her husband's power, and Tahmûrâf was swallowed up by his horse. But Yima managed to take back his brother's body from the body of Ahriman and recovered thereby the arts and civilisation which had disappeared along with Tahmûrâf (see Minokhired XXVII, 32; Ravâet apud Spiegel, Einleitung in die traditionelle Literatur, pp. 317 seq.; Ormazd et Ahriman, § 137 seq.; cf. above, <a href="sbe2310.htm#page_60">p. 60</a>, note <a href="sbe2310.htm#fn_302">1</a>).</p>
