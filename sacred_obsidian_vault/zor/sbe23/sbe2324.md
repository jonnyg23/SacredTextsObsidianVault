 <p><font size="-1">This Ya<i>s</i>t, inscribed to the Genius of the Earth, is devoted to a description of the mountains and the kingly Glory (kavaêm <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô), which are invoked, together with the Earth, in the corresponding formula of the Sîrôzah (§ 28): there is no Ya<i>s</i>t devoted to the Earth itself.</font></p>  
 <p>The mountains are simply enumerated (§§ 1-8). The rest of the Ya<i>s</i>t is devoted to the praise of the <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô, or, more precisely, to that of those who possessed it, whose powers or feats are described. The list begins with Ahura Mazda (§ 10), and closes with Saoshya<i>n</i><i>t</i> (§ 89); that is to say, it begins with the beginning of the world, and closes with its end. It includes the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas (§ 15), Haoshyangha (§ 26), Takhma Urupa (§ 28), Yima (§ 31), Mithra (§ 35), Thraêtaona (§ 36), Keresâspa (§ 38), the kings of the Kaianyan dynasty (§§ 66-72), Kavi Husravah (§ 74), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§ 79), Vî<i>s</i>tâspa (§ 84). The unsuccessful efforts of Franghrasyan to take possession of it are described at length (§§ 56-64).</p>  
 <p>This Ya<i>s</i>t would serve as a short history of the Iranian monarchy, an abridged Shah Nâmah.</p>
