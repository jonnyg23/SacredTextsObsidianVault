 <p><font size="-1">This Ya<i>s</i>t is a description of the fate that attends the soul of the righteous (§§ 1-18) and the soul of the wicked (§§ 19-37) after death. They spend the first three nights (the sadis or sidôs; cf. Commentaire du Vendîdâd, XIII, 55) amongst the highest enjoyments or pains; they are then met by their own conscience in the shape of a beautiful heavenly maiden (or a fiendish old woman <a name="fr_1397"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">1</font></a>), and are brought in four steps up to heaven or down to hell, through the three paradises of Good-Thought, Good-Word, and Good-Deed, or the three hells of Evil-Thought, Evil-Word, and Evil-Deed: there they are praised and glorified by Ahura, or rebuked and insulted by Angra Mainyu, and fed with ambrosia or poison.</font></p>  
 <p>Similar developments are to be found in Ya<i>s</i>t XXIV, 53-65; Ardâ Vîrâf XVII; Minokhired II, 123-194.</p>

 <p>1. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!</p>  
 <p>'When one of the faithful departs this life, where does his soul abide on that night?'</p>  
 <p>Ahura Mazda answered:</p>  
 <p>2. 'It takes its seat near the head, singing the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha <a name="fr_1398"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">2</font></a> and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes <a name="fr_1399"></a><a href="#fn_1332"><font size="1">3</font></a> as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.'</p>

 <p>3. —'On the second night where does his soul abide?</p>  
 <p>4. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It takes its seat near the head, singing the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.'</p>  
 <p>5. —'On the third night where does his soul abide?</p>  
 <p>6. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It takes its seat near the head, singing the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.'</p>  
 <p>7. At the end <a name="fr_1400"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the third night, when the dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if it were brought amidst plants and scents: it seems as if a wind were blowing from the region of the south, from the regions of the south, a sweet-scented wind, sweeter-scented than any other wind in the world.</p>  
 <p>8. And it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if he were inhaling that wind with the nostrils, and he thinks: 'Whence does that wind blow, the sweetest-scented wind I ever inhaled with my nostrils?</p>  
 <p>9. And it seems to him as if his own conscience were advancing to him in that wind, in the shape of a maiden fair, bright, white-armed, strong, tall-formed,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>high-standing, thick-breasted, beautiful of body, noble, of a glorious seed <a name="fr_1401"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of the size of a maid in her fifteenth year, as fair as the fairest things in the world.</p>  
 <p>10. And the soul of the faithful one addressed her, asking: 'What maid art thou, who art the fairest maid I have ever seen?'</p>  
 <p>11. And she, being his own conscience, answers him: 'O thou youth of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion, I am thy own conscience!</p>  
 <p>'Everybody did love thee for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength and freedom from sorrow, in which thou dost appear to me;</p>  
 <p>12. 'And so thou, O youth of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion! didst love me for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom from sorrow, in which I appear to thee.</p>  
 <p>13. 'When thou wouldst see a man making derision <a name="fr_1402"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">2</font></a> and deeds of idolatry, or rejecting <a name="fr_1403"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">3</font></a> (the poor) and shutting his door <a name="fr_1404"></a><a href="#fn_1337"><font size="1">4</font></a>, then thou wouldst sit singing the Gâthas and worshipping the good waters and Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and rejoicing <a name="fr_1405"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">5</font></a> the faithful that would come from near or from afar.</p>

 <p>14. 'I was lovely and thou madest me still lovelier; I was fair and thou madest me still fairer; I was desirable and thou madest me still more desirable; I was sitting in a forward place and thou madest me sit in the foremost place, through this good thought, through this good speech, through this good deed of thine; and so henceforth men worship me for my having long sacrificed unto and conversed with Ahura Mazda.</p>  
 <p>15. 'The first step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Thought <a name="fr_1406"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">1</font></a> Paradise;</p>  
 <p>'The second step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Word <a name="fr_1407"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">2</font></a> Paradise;</p>

 <p>16. Then one of the faithful, who had departed before him, asked him, saying: 'How didst thou depart this life, thou holy man? How didst thou come, thou holy man! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and enjoyments of love? From the material world into the world of the spirit? From the decaying world into the undecaying one? How long did thy felicity last?'</p>  
 <p>17. And Ahura Mazda answered: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who has just gone the dreary</p>

 <p>19. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!</p>  
 <p>'When one of the wicked perishes, where does his soul abide on that night?'</p>  
 <p>20. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It rushes and sits near the skull, singing the Kima <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1344"><font size="1">2</font></a> Gâtha, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!</p>  
 <p>' "To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying?"</p>  
 <p>'On that night his soul tastes as much of suffering as the whole of the living world can taste.'</p>  
 <p>21. —'On the second night, where does his soul abide?'</p>

 <p>'On that night his soul tastes as much of suffering as the whole of the living world can taste.'</p>  
 <p>25. At the end of the third night, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! when the dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithless one as if it were brought amidst snow and stench, and as if a wind were blowing from the region of the north, from the regions of the north, a foul-scented wind, the foulest-scented of all the winds in the world.</p>  
 <p>26-32. And it seems to the soul of the wicked man as if he were inhaling that wind with the nostrils, and he thinks: 'Whence does that wind blow, the foulest-scented wind that I ever inhaled with my nostrils <a name="fr_1412"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>

 <p>The second step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Evil-Word Hell;</p>  
 <p>The third step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Evil-Deed Hell;</p>  
 <p>The fourth step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Endless Darkness.</p>  
 <p>34. Then one of the wicked who departed before him addressed him, saying: 'How didst thou perish, O wicked man? How didst thou come, O fiend! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and enjoyments of love? From the material world into the world of the Spirit? From the decaying</p>  
 <p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a></p>  
 <p>world into the undecaying one? How long did thy suffering last?'</p>  
 <p>35. Angra Mainyu, the lying one, said: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who has just gone the dreary way, full of fear and distress, where the body and the soul part from one another.</p>  
 <p>36. 'Let him eat of the food brought unto him, of poison and poisonous stench <a name="fr_1413"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">1</font></a>: this is the food, after he has perished, for the youth of evil thoughts, evil words, evil deeds, evil religion after he has perished; this is the food for the fiendish woman, rich in evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds, evil religion, ill-principled, and disobedient to her husband.</p>

 <p>Then that wicked soul spoke thus: 'Who art thou? than whom I never saw any one of the creatures of Aûharmazd and Akharman uglier, or filthier or more stinking' (cf. § 10).</p>  
 <p>To him she spoke thus: 'I am thy bad actions, O youth of evil thoughts, of evil words, of evil deeds, of evil religion! It <a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a> is on account of thy will and actions that I am hideous and vile, iniquitous and diseased, rotten and foul-smelling, unfortunate and distressed, as appears to thee (cf. §§ 11-12).</p>  
 <p>'When thou sawest any one who performed the Yazishn and Drôn ceremonies, and praise and prayer and the service of God, and preserved and protected water and fire, cattle and trees, and other good creations, thou practisedst the will of Akharman and the demons, and improper actions. And when thou sawest one who provided hospitable reception, and gave something deservedly in gifts and charity, for the advantage of the good and worthy who came from far, and who were from near, thou wast avaricious, and shuttedst up thy door (cf. § 13).</p>  
 <p>'And though I have been unholy (that is, I have been considered bad), I am made more unholy through thee; and though I have been frightful, I am made more frightful through thee; though I have been tremulous, I am made more tremulous through thee; though I am settled in the northern region of the demons, I am settled further north through thee; through these evil thoughts, through these evil words, and through these evil deeds, which thou practisedst. They curse me, a long time, in the long execration and evil communion of the Evil Spirit (cf. § 14).</p>  
 <p>'Afterwards that soul of the wicked advanced the first footstep on Dûsh-hûmat (the place of evil thoughts), &amp;c.' (The Book of Ardâ Vîrâf, XVII, 12-27, as translated by Haug).</p>
