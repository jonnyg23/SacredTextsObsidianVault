 <p>1. My desire is also that I write a story (nisang-1) out of the accompanying inconsistency and full delusion of the same scripture, (2) that is full of every iniquity and demonism; and I <i>will</i> disclose a summary of one <i>part</i> out of a thousand of <i>what is</i> declared thereby, (3) <i>so as</i> to notice the commands therein.</p>  
 <p>4. First, this is what he says about his own nature, (5) that is, 'I am the Lord, seeking vengeance (6) and retaliating vengeance <a name="fr_967"></a><a href="#fn_959"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (7) and I retaliate vengeance sevenfold upon the children <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_960"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (8) and <i>one</i> does not forget my original vengeance.' (9). Another place states that, '<i>having</i> acquired <a name="fr_969"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">3</font></a> wrath and grievous thoughts, (10) his lips are also full of indignation <a name="fr_970"></a><a href="#fn_962"><font size="1">4</font></a>, (11) <i>his</i> tongue is like a blazing fire, (12) and <i>his</i> breath (vâyâ) is like a river of rapid water (arvand nâk) <a name="fr_971"></a><a href="#fn_963"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 13. His voice, too, as though for causing</p>

 <p>weeping, is more resembling the shouting of a demon <a name="fr_972"></a><a href="#fn_964"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (14) and his seat is in the gloom <a name="fr_973"></a><a href="#fn_965"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the dew, and the cloud <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_966"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 15. His charger, also, is the drying (khû<i>s</i>kâk) wind <a name="fr_975"></a><a href="#fn_967"><font size="1">4</font></a>, (16) and from the motion of his feet is the arising of a whirlwind of dust <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_968"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 17. When he walks the arising of fire is behind him <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_969"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>18. And, elsewhere, he speaks about his own wrathfulness, (19) thus: 'I have been forty years in wrath about the Israelites <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_970"><font size="1">7</font></a>,' (20) and he said that the Israelites are defiled in heart <a name="fr_979"></a><a href="#fn_971"><font size="1">8</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>21. Elsewhere he speaks thus: 'Who is blind <a name="fr_980"></a><a href="#fn_972"><font size="1">9</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>unless <i>it be</i> my servant? 22. Who is deaf <a name="fr_981"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">1</font></a>, but the messenger (firîstak) I am appointing? 23. Who is blind like the king <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">2</font></a>?' <i>And it is</i> declared that their king is the Lord himself <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>24. Elsewhere it also says this, that the worshippers (parastakân) of his fire are defiled <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 25. Also this, that his deeds bring blinding smoke, (26) <i>and his</i> fighting is the shedding of blood <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 27. And this, that is, 'I pour forth mankind one upon the other, (28) <i>and</i> I sit upon the sky, over their limbs.' 29. Likewise this, that, in one night, a hundred <i>and</i> sixty thousand <i>were</i> slain by him, through a wretched death, out of the champions and troops of the Mâzerdarâns <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 30. And, <i>on</i> another occasion, he slew six hundred thousand men, besides women and young children, out of the Israelites in the wilderness; (31) only two men escaped <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. Again, it shows that his final result is all regret, (33) just as this which it states, that he became among the despondent (zardakân), and he spoke thus: 'I am repentant as to the making of men on the earth <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>34. This, too, it states, that he sits upon a throne which four angels hold upon <i>their</i> wings, from each one of whom a fiery river always proceeds, owing to the load of <i>his</i> weight <a name="fr_989"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 35. Now, when he is a spirit, not formed with a body, why then are those four distressed by him, who <i>have</i> to sustain with toil the grievous load of that easy <i>thing?</i></p>  
 <p>36. Again, <i>it states</i> this, that every day he prepares, with his own hand, ninety thousand worshippers, and they always worship him until he night time, and then he dismisses them, through a fiery river, to hell <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 37. When trouble and injustice of this description are seen, how is it</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>expedient <i>for</i> worldly beings to exist in duty, good works, and good deeds? 38. When he casts distressed worshippers who are reverent, listening to commands, <i>and</i> pure in action, together with others <i>who are</i> sinners, into eternal hell, (39) <i>it is</i> like even that which another congregation <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">1</font></a> asserts, that the sacred being, <i>at</i> the day of the resurrection, gives the sun and moon, together with others <i>who are</i> sinners, to hell for the reason that there are people who <i>have</i> offered homage to them.</p>  
 <p>40. Another place also states this, that when the eyes of the aged (masâtval) <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">2</font></a> Abraham, who <i>was</i> the friend of the Lord, were afflicted, the Lord himself came enquiring for him; (41) and he sat <i>on</i> his cushion and asked for peace <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 42. And Abraham called Isaac <a name="fr_994"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who <i>was</i> his dearest son <a name="fr_995"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">5</font></a>, in secret, <i>and</i> spoke (43) thus: 'Go to paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t), <i>and</i> bring wine that is light and pure.' 44. <i>And</i> he went and brought it. 45. And Abraham made many entreaties to the Lord (46) thus: 'Taste one time <a name="fr_996"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">6</font></a> wine in my abode.' 47. <i>And</i> the Lord spoke thus:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'I <i>will</i> not taste <i>it</i>, because <i>it</i> is not from paradise, and is not pure.' 48. Then Abraham gave assurance thus: 'The wine is pure from paradise, and Isaac, who is my son, brought <i>it</i>.' 49. Thereupon the Lord, <i>on account of</i> his freedom from doubt in Isaac, and the assurance <i>given</i> by Abraham, tasted the wine one time. 50. Afterwards, when he wished to go, <i>he was</i> not allowed until one of them <i>had</i> sworn <i>to</i> the other by a serious oath <a name="fr_997"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>51. Observe this twaddle full of delusion; not even a single <i>detail</i> is adapted to a sacred being. 52. In what way <i>was</i> his coming in bodily form to the abode of Abraham and eating bread, of which not even a single <i>detail</i> is adapted to him? 53. This, too, is evident, from it, that the suffering of Abraham was not <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">2</font></a> from the Lord, but from another producer. 54. And even the faultiness <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">3</font></a> which <i>was</i> owing to his want of understanding of knowledge was such, that the purity of the wine and whence <i>it came</i> were not known by him. 55. His falsity<i></i> is also <i>seen in</i> this, when he spoke of not drinking the wine, and <i>at</i> last drank <i>it</i>. 56. Afterwards he is confessing that it is genuine <i>and</i> pure. 57. Now, how is he worthy of worship, as a divinity that is all-knowing <i>and</i> almighty, whose nature is this?</p>  
 <p>58. And another place states that <i>there</i> was one of the sick who, with his own wife and child, <i>was</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>particularly <i>one</i> that was suffering, poor, <i>and</i> without a stipend. 59. <i>At</i> all times he was very diligent and active in prayer and fasting and the worship of the sacred being. 60. And one day, in prayer, he secretly begged a favour thus: 'Give me any enjoyment that is in daily food (rô<i>z</i>îh), (61) that it may be easier for me to live.'</p>  
 <p>62. And an angel came down unto him <i>and</i> spoke thus: 'The sacred being has not allotted thee, through the constellations <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">1</font></a>, more daily food than this, (63) <i>and</i> it is not possible to allot anew; (64) but, as a recompense for worship <i>and</i> prayer, a throne whose four feet are of jewels is appointed for thee in heaven (vahi<i>s</i>t) by me, (65) <i>and</i>, if it be necessary, I <i>will</i> give unto thee one foot of that throne.'</p>  
 <p>66. That exalter of the apostles enquired of his own wife, (67) <i>and</i> the unfortunate <i>one</i> spoke thus: '<i>It is</i> better for us to be content with the scanty daily food and bad living in the worldly <i>existence</i>, (68) than if our throne, among <i>our</i> companions in heaven, <i>had</i> three feet; (69) but if it may occur to thee then appoint us a day's food by another mode.'</p>  
 <p>70. <i>At</i> the second coming of that angel he spoke thus: 'But if I dissipate the <i>celestial</i> sphere, and produce the sky <i>and</i> earth anew, and construct and produce the motion of the stars anew, <i>still</i> thenceforth <i>it</i> is not clear whether thy destiny <i>will</i> fall <i>out</i> good or bad <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>71. From this statement <i>it</i> is, therefore, manifest that he is not himself the appointer of daily food and supreme, (72) distribution is not by his will,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>he is</i> not able to alter destiny, (73) and the revolution of the <i>celestial</i> sphere, the sun <i>and</i> moon and stars, is not within the compass of his knowledge, will, and command. 74. <i>And</i> also this, that the throne, as to which <i>it was</i> announced (nivîkînî<i>d</i>) thus: 'I <i>will</i> give <i>it</i> in heaven,' is not of his formation and creation.</p>  
 <p>75. And <i>in</i> another place he speaks about his own twaddle (76) thus: 'I <i>have</i> slain, <i>in</i> one day <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">1</font></a>, an assemblage (ram) of sinners, as well as innumerable innocents.' 77. <i>And</i> when the angels talked much of the unreasonable performance, he then spoke of it thus: 'I am the Lord, the ruler of wills, (78) superintending, unrivalled, and doing <i>my own</i> will, and no one assists <i>or</i> is to utter a murmur (dren<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) about me <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_995"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>79. Especially abundant is the twaddle that is completely delusive, which <i>has</i> seemed to me tedious to write. 80. Whoever would investigate the backward opinions of these statements, should be, for that purpose of his, a high-priest speaking candidly (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>), (81) until he becomes aware of the nature of the same scripture, and <i>of</i> the truth of that which is stated by me.</p>  
 <p>82. Now if he <i>be</i> a sacred being, of whom these are signs and tokens, that <i>implies that</i> truth is far from him, (83) forgiveness strange to him, (84) and knowledge is not bestowed upon him. 85. Because this itself is the fiend who is leader of the hell which</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the den (grêstak) of the gloomy race, (86) whom the devilish defiled <i>ones and</i> evil <i>people</i> glorify by the name of the Lord, and offer <i>him</i> homage.</p>  
 <p>87. About this subject is here complete.</p>
