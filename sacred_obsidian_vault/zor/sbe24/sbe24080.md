 <p>1. Another subject is about the deliberating of the deliberators on unity, from which even the preparation of the duality is manifested.</p>  
 <p>2. It should be known, that whoever wishes to understand a creator, except when he gives trouble to his own life, (3) should meditate reverently <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 4. First, he fully understands his own body and soul, (5) that is, who produced <i>them</i>, out of what, and for what purpose? 6. Also, who is his accuser and adversary; (7) and who is his friend and helper? 8. Likewise, who instigates him to commit crime, (9) of what nature <i>is he</i>, (10) and how is it possible to escape him?</p>  
 <p>11. Then <i>he</i> is not able to understand him <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>as</i> the creator through his nature and his coming to himself. 12. For when he bore the name of creator, then, with it, he brought these three creations <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">3</font></a>:(13) creation, religion, and soul. 14. Because the name of creator is known from the occurrence of creation. 15. This <i>implies</i> that the creator of the creation created the creations for duty, (16) but does not release <i>them</i> from duty. 17. And the duty of the creatures is to understand <i>and</i> perform the will of the creator, (18) <i>and</i> to abstain from <i>what is</i> disliked <i>by him</i>. 19. To act by the will of the creator, and to abstain from <i>what is</i> disliked by him, is to preserve the soul. 20. The will of the creator is not understood,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>  
 <p>except from the religion of the creator. 21. <i>And</i> the religion is appointed by the creator free from doubt.</p>  
 <p>22. Now it is expedient to know that the sacred being appointed the religion for the understanding of his will, (23) and from the understanding of his will for the preservation of the soul are manifested the compassion and mercifulness of the sacred being. 24. From the preservativeness of the religion for the soul are manifested the grandeur and valuableness of the religion; (25) from the necessity of preserving the soul are manifested the defilement and delusion <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the soul; (26) <i>and</i> from the defilement and delusion of the soul is manifested a defiler and deluder of the thoughts, words, <i>and</i> deeds of mankind. 27. On the whole a corrupter of souls is manifest.</p>  
 <p>28. And now it is expedient for us to well recognise <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">2</font></a> and know, as to that defiler who is a corrupter of souls, of what nature <i>he is</i>. 29. Because, if the creation <i>and</i> achievement of the sacred being are said <i>to be</i> of a like nature, then how did the sacred being appoint the religion for the preservation of the soul? 30. That is not expedient for him<i>if</i> a defiler and deluder of soulsto produce <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">3</font></a> as his own creation and will <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 31. For if he be himself the creator, and be himself the defiler and corrupter of souls, <i>and</i> nothing occurs except by his will, (32)</p>

 <p>then, when it is necessary for us to write of preservation from the sacred being <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whom <i>shall</i> we make <i>as</i> a refuge <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">2</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>33. Now it is necessary <i>for</i> every intelligent person to understand <i>and</i> to know thus much, (34) that is, from whom it is necessary for us to flee and to abstain, (35) and with whom is the hope, and with whom the maintenance, of our protection. 36. The method for this acquisition is nothing else but to understand the sacred being in <i>his</i> nature, (37) because, as I wrote above <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>it</i> is not only to know <i>his</i> existence, but it is necessary to understand <i>his</i> nature and his will.</p>  
 <p>38. And I <i>have</i> observed, in the world, the sectarian belief of all maintainers of sects who hold [the two fundamental <i>doctrines</i>] <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 39. One is that which asserts that all the good and evil, which are in the world, are owing to the sacred being. 40. <i>And</i> one is that which asserts that all the good of the world, besides the hope of preserving the soul, is owing to the sacred being; (41) and the cause of all evil of the body, besides the risk of the soul, is owing to Aharman; (42) <i>and</i> all <i>things</i> have started from appointment <i>by</i> these two origins into various formations <i>and</i> various subdivisions.</p>  
 <p>43. Now I have been an enquirer everywhere, for understanding the sacred being, as written above <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">5</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>

 <p>fervent-minded in the investigation of his religion and will; (44) as likewise I have wandered, for the sake of investigation, to the region without and the land of the Hindûs, and <i>to</i> many different races. 45. Because, <i>as to</i> religion, I did not admire that which <i>was</i> in supremacy <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (46) but <i>I</i> sought that which <i>was</i> more steadfast and more acceptable in wisdom and testimony. 47. I went also into association with many different races, (48) until a time (49) when, owing to the compassion of the sacred beings, and the strength, glory, and power of the good religion, I escaped from much gloomy depth and ill-solvable doubt.</p>  
 <p>50. By the united power of knowledge of the religion (51) and the well-reflecting writing of the wise, (52) the marvellous allegorical <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">2</font></a> writings of the learned Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (53) and by that writing which the glorified Rôshan <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">4</font></a>, son of Âtûr-frôbag, prepared(54) for which he appointed the name of the Rôshan manuscript (nipîk)(55) <i>and</i> likewise that <i>for</i> which the supremely learned <i>and</i> righteous Âtûr-frôbag <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">5</font></a>, son of Farukh-zâ<i>d</i>, (56) who <i>was</i> the</p>

 <p>leader of those of the good religion, (57) appointed the name of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscriptowing to <i>its</i> explaining the religion <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">1</font></a>(58) I am saved from the many doubts, delusions, deceits, and follies of sects, (59) and, especially, from those of the deceivers, the very great <i>and</i> very mighty, very evil-teaching <i>and</i> empty-skulled <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">2</font></a> Manicheans <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (60) whose devotion is witchcraft, <i>whose</i> religion is deceitfulness, and <i>whose</i> teaching is folly and intricate secret proceedings.</p>  
 <p>61. I have been deliberately confirmed by the power of wisdom and the strength of knowledge of the religion, (62) not through obstinate faith <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">4</font></a>, but by the pure revelation opposed to the demon <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">5</font></a>, which is the decision of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> (63) that <i>was</i> taught by the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>

 <p>archangels, <i>together</i> with many miracles. 66. And a greatness in power which is not the destiny of worldly existences was theirs who saw him of the vehement guardian spirit. 67. And Kaî Spend-dâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Zargar <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">2</font></a> and other <i>royal</i> sons (zâ<i>d</i>ak), instigating the many conflicts and shedding the blood of those of the realm, accepted the religion as a yoke <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (68) while they even wandered to Arûm <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">4</font></a> and the Hindûs, outside the realm, in propagating the religion.</p>  
 <p>69. Owing to <i>progress</i> onwards it came in succession to the descendants of the divinities <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the rulers who <i>were</i> those of the Kayân race who <i>were</i> exalted ones. 70. <i>And</i> still onwards even until the achievement with melted metal pouring upon the chest of the glorified Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">6</font></a>, son of Mâraspend, in the reign of that divinity (bagh) Shâhpûr, the king of kings who <i>was the son of</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">7</font></a>, in a controversy with apostates of different species of many kinds. 71. <i>He was</i> preserved from those most</p>

 <p>72. And the Arûmans <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who have been, at various periods, termed untruthful <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>have</i> asked many ill-solvable questions of this religion; (73) <i>but there has</i> been no doubtfulness of any question that is explained by this religion, (74) and the learned of the country of Irân have always been sustainers of victory among them. 75. Not like other sects whose religion is secretly progressive and deceiving, delusively for the deceived, <i>and</i> undutifully among the customs and assemblages of the less-informed, unintelligent, and demon-natured whose information was nothing whatever of knowledge and understanding of wisdom. 76. Then, so far as the assemblages that are very secretly deceived and deluded by them, nobody is presented for detection (â<i>s</i>kârâkîh); (77) <i>but</i> afterwards, owing to the capture of the many of little knowledge and unintelligent opinions who are deluded by them, it is discovered they are <i>provided</i> with much mutually afflicting speech, falsehood, <i>and</i> disconnection, which are their religion.</p>  
 <p>78. So that I here <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">4</font></a> notice <i>some</i> of <i>their</i> much inconsistency and disconnection, for informing the judgment of new learners, (79) for the reason that when the writings of the learned ancients have specially minutely and reverently <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">5</font></a> discoursed of</p>
