 <p>1. Other information about the existence of the competitor, similarly testified by the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">2</font></a> manuscript (nipîk), is here well noted for you. 2. For both this <i>which is</i> written above and that which is written <i>here</i> are all grown from the seed which the glorified Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand sowed, (3) and <i>from</i> the original thanksgiving (spâs) of the supremely learned Âtû<i>r</i>-frôbag, son of Farukh-zâ<i>d</i>, himself.</p>  
 <p>4. The fourth <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">3</font></a> subject, which is from the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, is about the existence of an opponent of the creatures and of an opponent earlier than the creatures, and is from the exposition of the good religion <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>5. <i>That</i> is, a knowledge of the existence of an opponent of the creatures is obtainable from the innermost <i>recesses</i> of the body of man even to the outermost <i>objects</i> of which <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">1</font></a> sight is susceptible, (6) and beyond those, within the certain limits of analogy. 7. The innermost <i>recesses</i> of man are the innermost of life, (8) <i>and</i> are seen through complete observation, within the same limits.</p>  
 <p>9. This is, as ignorance is to erudition, (10) deceit to good disposition, (11) and falsehood to truth, (12) other defects of the capabilities which are the source of erudition, good disposition, and truth are the opponent, (13) and the cause of the wickedness of the soul. 14. Again, these irregularities of the rules of arrangement of the body, within the compass of the body, are the opponent, and the cause of the disintegration of the body. 15. Again, <i>as to</i> these among the emanations, cold is the opponent of heat, dryness is of moisture, <i>and</i> the other doers of mischief are <i>opponents</i> of the operations of existence.</p>  
 <p>16. Within time darkness is the opponent of light, stench of perfume, ugliness of handsomeness, unsavouriness of savouriness, poison of <i>its</i> antidote, noxious creatures and the wolf of the well-yielding cattle, <i>and</i> the vile felon (mar) of the good man. 17. Beyond time the brigand <i>planets</i> (gadûgân) <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">2</font></a> are the opponents of the work of the divine bestowers.</p>  
 <p>18. Beyond the knowledge obtainable of all these</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>champions susceptible to sight, are those who are within the limits of analogy <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the certain information of multitudes, the demons who are the opponents of the sacred beings.</p>  
 <p>19. The existence of an opponent before the creation of the creatures, and his coming to the creatures (20) after, the creation of the creatures, <i>and</i> also to the creator, are presented comprehensibly through reasons which are suitable <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>and</i> presentable, <i>and</i> through the provision of a remedy, a creation which is for a purpose. 21. This one statement (vâ<i>k</i>ak) possesses five arguments (sâmân). 22. One is the <i>being</i> presented comprehensibly. 23. One is the <i>being</i> presented through reasons. 24. One is the reasons which are presentable <i>and</i> suitable that the creation existed. 25. One is the remedy appointed for the creation. 26. <i>And</i> one is the creation of the creatures of the creator for a purpose.</p>  
 <p>27. The existence of these five arguments is manifest through the creations <i>and</i> achievements themselves. 28. The presenting comprehensibly is wisely arranging the testimony of the effect <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the creatures, (29) through the reasons presented, which are a declaration owing to the same sagacity. 30. The reason obtainable, that the creation existed, (31) with the arrangement of the creation so methodically, ought to arise from the suitable <i>state</i> of the</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p>creation; (32) and the suitable design of the creation itself possesses the testimony, through <i>its</i> appearance. 33. The remedy appointed is a comprehensible <i>and</i> presentable demonstrator, (34) because it becomes a desire of knowledge and an appearance of the desire. 35. The <i>being</i> created for a purpose is manifest through the desire of activity of the creation, both severally and naturally.</p>  
 <p>36. The evidences of the existence of an opponent before the creation of the creatures are many. 37. And one of them is the suitable <i>state</i> of the creation of the creatures, (38) because the limit of suitability is not well fitted for anything except necessity. (39) That <i>which</i> is <i>inferred</i> from suitability is necessity, from necessity haste, <i>and</i> from haste the existence of an opponent who is before the suitable work which is the creation.</p>  
 <p>40. The evidence of the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, after the creation of the creatures, is the formation of the means of the creator, for encountering an opponent, before the arrival of the opponent, (41) which are omnisciently a provision before creation by the creator. 42. And there is a demonstrator of <i>these</i> same means of the creatures that is prepared, which is the struggling opposed to the opponent through the arrangement of <i>their</i> nature. 43. One duty of the nature of the creatures is the subduing of so much vexation. 44. Their preparation, too, is like a contest that is forming an enemy opposing the opponent, (45) and their natural desire for duty is removing all haste.</p>
