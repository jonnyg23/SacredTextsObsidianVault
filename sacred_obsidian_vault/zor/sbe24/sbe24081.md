 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Pahlavi Texts, Part III (SBE24)</i>, E.W. West, tr. [1885], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XI.</h3>  
 <p>1. Henceforth I write <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>of</i> the inconsistency of their twaddle, and <i>of</i> just observations (2) you should estimate with wise regard.</p>  
 <p>3. First, <i>as to</i> the full consideration of that one original evolution (4) which they state thus: 'The sacred being is one, doing good works, wise, powerful, compassionate, <i>and</i> merciful, (5) so that good works <i>and</i> crime, truth <i>and</i> falsehood, life <i>and</i> death, good <i>and</i> evil are <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">2</font></a> owing to him <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now do ye ask of them (7) thus: 'Is the sacred being always compassionate <i>and</i> showing mercy, doing good works <i>and</i> judicious, and does he know all <i>that</i> is, was, <i>and will</i> be; <i>and</i> is <i>he</i> advancing the desire of <i>one's</i> wishes in everything, even <i>in</i> this where judiciousness is interference, or when such is not so? 8. Because, if <i>he be</i> compassionate, doing good works, <i>and</i> showing mercy, why then are Aharman and the demons and all these evil faiths <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">4</font></a> of hell admitted <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>by him to his own creatures, through his own compassion, doing of good works, <i>and</i> showing of mercy? 9. If not known by him, where are that knowledge and omniscience of his? 10. If he did not wish to keep misery and evil away from the creatures, and to produce only happiness <i>for</i> every one, where are that judiciousness and interference of his? 11. If it were not possible that it should not be produced by him, for what is that omnipotence of his (12) which we <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">1</font></a> every one, as <i>it were</i>, observe <i>and</i> well consider?'</p>  
 <p>13. Whenever they say <i>that</i> every good and evil <i>has</i> arisen from the sacred beingexcept when they separate from him these four attributes (hûnar), requisite for divinity, which are omniscience, omnipotence, goodness, <i>and</i> mercifulness(14) there is then no possibility of it. 15. When, indeed, they separate from him <i>only</i> one of these four attributes, even then <i>he</i> is not complete in divinity. 16. For if a sacred being be he <i>who is</i> omniscient, omnipotent, good, and merciful, then he who is not omniscient, <i>or</i> not omnipotent, <i>or</i> not good, or not merciful is not a sacred being.</p>  
 <p>17. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that when <i>he is</i> a ruler, advancing desires in every person <i>and</i> thing, why are that country and empire of his own not so kept, without help, from every enemy and adversity <i>apart</i> from his own work, so that <i>there</i> would not be anything whatever of distress, oppression, injustice, and complaint for any one in his empire? 18. Since the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>rule <i>and</i> empire of a man, <i>who is</i> ruler and emperor, are then commendable when <i>it</i> is possible for him so to protect <i>and</i> keep his own country <i>and</i> empire, through his own wisdom, that they <i>may</i> not assist his enemy to detract from his work, and to produce sin <i>and</i> harm. 19. Or, when his enemy covets <i>some</i> of his work, he is enabled to keep him away from his own thoughtful friends, <i>and</i> to make every one free from distress.</p>  
 <p>20. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that when <i>he is</i> triumphant, victorious, and prevailing, (21) over whom are that triumph, victory, and prevailing of his? 22. Since triumph and victory are over enemies, a competitor exists. 23. It is not expedient <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">1</font></a> to become himself a competitor <i>and</i> enemy to his own; (24) while when there is no enemy <i>and</i> competitor of his, over whom does he become triumphant and victorious? 25. That <i>sort of</i> triumph and victory is not spoken about, (26) because even cattle and sheep, when they have no opponent and injurer, are victorious and triumphant over themselves.</p>  
 <p>27. Again, <i>observe</i> this, is a wise <i>being</i> contented with his own divinity and grandeur, or not? 28. If the wise <i>being</i> be contented, then he <i>has</i> become contented to produce an enemy and criminal, <i>and</i> to admit all <i>that is</i> devastating into a country, through his own knowledge and will, for the benefit of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>country and creatures. 29. <i>But</i> why <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">1</font></a> is it expedient to seek a disposition of crime <i>and</i> evil, to become himself an enemy <i>and</i> curser as regards them, <i>and</i> to provide a hellish <i>existence</i>, becoming the misery of mankind?</p>  
 <p>30. Again, <i>observe</i> this, <i>as to</i> whatever he says, does he speak truly <i>and</i> credibly, or not? 31. If he speaks that truly <i>and</i> credibly which he states thus: 'I am a friend of good works and an enemy of crime,' (32) <i>and</i> always produces more crime <i>and</i> criminals than good works <i>and</i> doers of good works, (33) where is that truthful speaking of his?</p>  
 <p>34. Again, <i>observe</i> this, is his desire goodness, or vileness? 35. If his desire <i>be</i> vileness, whence is that divinity of his? 36. If his desire <i>be</i> goodness, then why are the vile and vileness more than the good and goodness?</p>  
 <p>37. Again, <i>observe</i> this, is he merciful, or not? 38. If he <i>be</i> not merciful, whence is that divinity of his? 39. If he <i>be</i> merciful, then why does he speak thus: 'The hearts, ears, <i>and</i> eyes of mankind are bent about by me, so that it is not possible for them to think, speak, <i>or</i> do <i>anything</i> but that which is wanted by me <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">2</font></a>; (40) be it what <i>has</i> made them great <i>and</i> noble, through <i>being</i> without want; (41) <i>or</i> be it what <i>has</i> admitted them to eternal hell, slain <i>and</i> exterminated by death of many kinds. 42. So that while those whom I force back become good <i>and</i> more active in good works, (43) yet still those who</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>are forced back do only a little <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (44) <i>and</i> are much more criminal <i>and</i> more sinful than those who are forward.'</p>  
 <p>45. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that if, whatever he does, he does wisely and for a purpose, (46) then, when no opponent and adversary of his existed, why <i>did</i> the first achievement which <i>was</i> prepared by him <i>become</i> servants to demoniacal disobedience, who are perverted thereby, among mankind, to wickedness <i>and</i> a hellish <i>existence</i> <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">2</font></a>? 47. If <i>it were</i> not known by him that they <i>would</i> become perverted, it was expedient (sa<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>) for him to order the making of a trial of them, (48) because now many thousands <i>and</i> myriads who <i>are</i> prepared by him, so that they <i>may</i> serve him and exhilarate (mastend) his rule, have become in every mode disobedient <i>and</i> unhappily advised. 49. for with that scanty knowledge that mankind <i>possess</i>, which is not so prepared <i>and</i> organized as is the wish of mankind, (50) if even anything arises, that they construct <i>and</i> prepare, which does not so come on <i>and</i> become <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">3</font></a> as is their wish, they do not stop again, a second <i>time</i>, for the preparation of that thing, <i>but</i> they refrain from it.</p>  
 <p>51. <i>As to</i> him, that omnipotent <i>and</i> omniscient ruler, of the abundant <i>and</i> innumerable things <i>he has</i> hitherto made and prepared not even one comes on <i>and</i> becomes such as is his wish, yet still he never refrains from the preparation <i>and</i> production of many new <i>things</i>. 52. Just as when <i>he was</i> the creator of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p>  
 <p>that <i>one</i> of his first angels whom, on account of affection, he prepared out of fire, <i>and for</i> several thousand years, (53) as they say, <i>they</i> always performed his worship; (54) at last <i>that one was</i> undone by one command that was given by him (the creator) thus: 'Offer homage to this first of mankind, who is prepared by me out of clay.' 55. And deliverance, as to <i>what</i> is not expedient to offer, <i>was</i> expressly mentioned by him. 56. Then <i>that one</i> acted scornfully <i>and</i> contemptibly as to his clay and curse and wrath; (57) and, <i>being</i> perverted to devilry and fiendishness, <i>he was</i> forced out of heaven, (58) <i>and was</i> given a life of millenniums <i>and</i> an eternal dominion, (59) so that <i>he said</i>, 'I <i>will</i> go <i>and</i> make my servants and worshippers astray <i>and</i> deluded <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 60. And he <i>was</i> made an injurer and adversary at his own will.</p>  
 <p>61. <i>At</i> last also that man, to whom he, the supreme angel, was ordered to offer homage with many worshippers, for the sake of affection and respect, (62) is appointed to the garden of paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t), (63)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>so that he <i>may</i> cultivate <i>it</i> and eat all the fruit, (64) except <i>of</i> that one tree of which <i>it</i> is ordered thus: Ye shall not eat <i>of it</i> <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 65. And with them (mankind) the deceiver, who is the deluder prepared by him (the creator), (66) is let into the garden. 67. There are <i>some</i> who say <i>he is</i> a serpent <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and</i> there are <i>some</i> who <i>say he is</i> Aharman <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 68. And an inclination <i>for</i> eating <i>and</i> greediness is given by that same <i>one</i> himself to mankind. 69. Then, being deceived <i>by</i> that deluder <i>saying:</i> 'Eat of that tree'(70) there are <i>some</i> who say <i>he spoke to</i> Adam(71) they ate through that inclination for eating <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>72. After eating they became so imbued with knowledge that good and evil <i>were</i> understood and known by them <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 73: <i>Deprived</i> of that so-great respect and affection, through that one injunction which <i>was</i> forgotten by them(74) and that forgetfulness <i>being</i> likewise owing to that cause(75) they are forced out of the garden of paradise <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">6</font></a><i>he</i> with <i>his</i> wifeby grievous wrath and disrespect, (76) <i>and</i> are delivered into the hand of that enemy who is a deceiver and deluder; (77) so that he <i>has</i> propagated</p>

 <p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a></p>  
 <p>his own will among them, <i>and has</i> fashioned <i>it</i> upon them.</p>  
 <p>78. Now which <i>was</i> unjust, the unreasonable command, the after-wisdom, <i>or</i> the scanty knowledge that <i>was</i> more faulty and more mischievous than these? 79. Also this, that is, why <i>was</i> that garden not made by him fortified and strong, so that that deluder could not have gone into <i>it?</i></p>  
 <p>80. Even now<i></i> he (<i>the deceiver</i>) <i>has</i> made and makes multitudes <i>of</i> his (the creator's) servants <i>and</i> worshippers deluded; (81) and, for the same reason, multitudes <i>of</i> apostles <i>and</i> prophets (vakhshvarân) are appointed by him (the creator) for the worldly <i>existence at</i> various times, (82) so that, <i>as he says:</i> 'They <i>may</i> save my servants from the hand of that deluder, (83) <i>and</i> bring<i></i> them into the true path and way <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 84. And even those worshippers of his, <i>in</i> every way through their own will, have slain <i>and</i> subdued (khvâft), by a wretched death, his own apostles <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whose diligence had brought mankind into the proper path and doctrine.</p>  
 <p>85. That original deluder and misleader is allowed an eternal life. 86. <i>And</i>, even till now, his will is more triumphant <i>and</i> absolute than that of the sacred being, through deluding <i>and</i> misleading, (87) because those deluded <i>and</i> astray are much more numerous than those in the true path <i>and</i> undeluded.</p>  
 <p>88. Again, <i>observe</i> this, does he do whatever he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p>does for a purpose, or not? 89. If he does <i>it</i> without a purpose, <i>he</i> is working foolishly; (90) and it is not proper to praise him who is working foolishly as a sagacious divinity. 91. If he does <i>it</i> for a purpose, (92) then, when no opponent and adversary of his existed, why is the production of all these creatures which are even like demons, disobedient men <i>with</i> the opposing will of that contentious deluder, and innumerable unprofitable creatures?</p>  
 <p>93. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that, if he knows all <i>that</i> is, was, <i>and will</i> be, it was not expedient for him to produce, through his own knowledge and will, anything of that of which he <i>may be</i> sorry, and <i>which</i> remains opposing his will and command, (94) and becomes an adversary of his apostles <i>and</i> the doers of <i>his</i> will.</p>  
 <p>95. If they say that this adversary <i>was</i> produced good and virtuous from the beginning, <i>and</i> afterwards became an evil and a misleading of the creatures, (96) that <i>implies</i>, you should say, that, when he is all-powerful, the purpose <i>and</i> will of the adversary, in changing into an evil and a misleading of the creatures, are more successful and more powerful than those of the sacred being; (97) because the evil in <i>any</i> period is stronger than the good.</p>  
 <p>98. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that when a criminal <i>arises</i> wholly through his will <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (99) and the minds of criminals are defiled by him himself, (100) and the seed of crime is sown by him himself, (101) when <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>it has</i> grown who <i>has</i> maintained <i>its</i> origin? 102.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>And</i> by what power of adjudication is one executed <i>and</i> one rewarded <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">1</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>103. Again, <i>observe</i> this, <i>was</i> this world made and created by him (the creator) for a purpose, for his own pleasure <i>and</i> for the sake of the comfort and happiness of mankind, or without a purpose, for his own discomfort and the hurry, trouble, pain, <i>and</i> death of mankind? 104. For if made by him without a purpose, <i>he was</i> acting foolishly; (105) a thing without a purpose <i>being</i> not acceptable by the wise. 106. If made by him for a purpose, and created by him for his own pleasure and the comfort and happiness of mankind, (107) why <i>was</i> it not made by him prosperous <i>and</i> full of happiness?</p>  
 <p>108. If his pleasure and happiness <i>arise</i> from the preparation of mankind and the creatures, what is the advantage from their slaughter and devastation? 109. If thoughts of crime are not given by him himself to mankind, who is he who gives thoughts of crime different from his command and will? 110. If <i>they</i> are given by him himself, and he now considers them a fault, what is that justice and arbitration of his owing to? 111. For when mankind, with little knowledge and little wisdom, even then, so far as they are able, do not let the lion and wolf <i>and</i> other noxious creatures in among their own young ones <i>and</i> pregnant <i>females</i>, (112) so long as they can destroy them, (113) why <i>has</i> the merciful sacred being now let <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">2</font></a> Aharman and the demons in upon his own creatures, (114) so that they have</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>  
 <p>made them vile <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">1</font></a>, defiled, wicked, <i>and</i> hellish? 115. If done for the sake of experiment, just as that which they assert, that evil <i>was</i> created by him for the sake of an experiment as regards the creatures, (116) why <i>was</i> it not understood by him before those men and creatures <i>existed?</i> 117. Because <i>he</i> whose custom <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">2</font></a> is experiment is not to be called omniscient.</p>  
 <p>118. The conclusion is this, that the sacred being, if <i>there</i> existed no opponent and adversary of his, was able to create all those creatures and creations of his free from misfortune; why did <i>he</i> not <i>so</i> create <i>them?</i> 119. Or was it not possible for him to wish <i>it?</i> 120. If it were not possible for him to wish <i>it, he</i> is not completely capable. 121. If it were possible for him not to wish <i>it, he</i> is not merciful. 122. If <i>it were</i> known by him that <i>he might say:</i> 'Something <i>or</i> some one <i>will</i> arise, from these creatures <i>and</i> creations which I create, that <i>will</i> not <i>be</i> according to my will,' (123) and ultimately he made <i>them</i>, (124) then to attach now all this wrath <i>and</i> cursing and casting away for punishment in hell, discontentedly to his own performance, is unreasonable.</p>  
 <p>125. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that if all the crime-meditating <i>and</i> crime-committing sin which mankind think <i>and</i> speak <i>and</i> do, as well as pain, sickness, poverty, <i>and</i> the punishment <i>and</i> misery of hell, cannot arise, except by the will and command of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacred being(126) the will <i>and</i> power of the sacred being <i>being</i> eternal <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (127) because his self-existence is also eternal(128) the hopelessness of eternally saving any one whatever from misery and punishment is now certain. 129. For <i>it</i> is repeatedly declared that there is no learned teacher whatever who keeps one away from these mischievous evil desires, (130) if the worshipper <i>be even of</i> the same kind <i>as</i> those worshippers <i>and</i> high-priests who <i>have</i> issued to mankind this admonition: 'Commit no crime <i>and</i> sin.' 131. Because they wish to set aside the will <i>and</i> command of the sacred being <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 132. <i>Observe</i> this, too, that, as both are his will, alike crime <i>and</i> alike good works, <i>it</i> is not manifest whether he approves the good works of doers of good works more, or the crimes of criminals.</p>  
 <p>133. Likewise <i>observe</i> this, those physicians who, on account of the hope of the soul, prepare the medicine of the sick, (134) and remove <i>and</i> dismiss their pain and disease, (115) so that merit is possessed by them (the physicians) owing to that practice; (136) yet they <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">3</font></a> are prepared for the punishment of hell. 137. And those who, on account of affection <i>for</i> the soul, give something <i>to</i> poor, begging, suffering people, (138) and thereby scatter <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>and</i> dismiss their want <i>and</i> poverty, (139) so that merit is possessed by them (the charitable)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p>owing to that practice; (140) yet it becomes grievous sin for them <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">1</font></a>, through anxiety. 141. If they say that those physicians <i>and</i> the remedies which they offer, <i>and</i> also those who give something <i>to</i> the poor <i>and</i> suffering, all <i>exist</i> by the will of the sacred being, (142) it is easier, more reasonable, <i>and</i> more adapted to divinity, when the sacred being is without an adversary <i>and</i> without an opponent, for him not to create that disease <i>and</i> poverty (143) than <i>that, as to</i> those that <i>he</i> himself is to make sick <i>and</i> poor, he <i>should have</i> commanded mankind thus: 'Ye shall make them healthy <i>and</i> free from want.' 144. If they say that his desire is this, that he <i>may</i> occasion the happiness of those physicians <i>and</i> givers by the recompense for it, (145) and make them proceed <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">2</font></a> to the eternal happiness of heaven (vahi<i>s</i>t); (146) you should observe, <i>as to</i> that, since he acts injudiciously <i>and</i> incapably when, on account of the existence of a complete desire for happiness <i>and</i> prosperity <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">3</font></a> among others, <i>he</i> is an attainer of misery <i>for</i> multitudes <i>of</i> the innocent who are distressed, poor, necessitous, <i>and</i> sick, (147) this <i>may</i> also <i>be said</i>, that if <i>it be</i> not possible for him to occasion happiness and prosperity <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">4</font></a> as regards one, except by the distress, pain, and vexation of some other, (148) that <i>shows that</i> his absolute power <i>and</i> freedom from opposition are not adapted for effectual operation. 149. If they say</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a></p>  
 <p>that he makes those sick <i>and</i> poor proceed to the eternal happiness of heaven in the spiritual <i>existence</i>, as a recompense for it, (150) that <i>implies</i>, if <i>it be</i> not possible, <i>or</i> not completely possible, for him to give the recompense in the spiritual <i>existence</i>, except through the misery of the worldly <i>one</i>, (151) also this, thathis production of distress in the worldly <i>existence arising</i> unquestionably <i>and</i> unreasonably, through <i>its</i> previous occurrence, (152) <i>and</i> the recompense of the spiritual <i>existence arising</i> doubtfully <i>and</i> incredibly after the production of the distress(153) just as the previous distress is unreasonable, the after recompense <i>occurs</i> alike unreasonably <i>and</i> foolishly. 154. This also <i>may be said</i>, that no after nobility is obtained for previous distress without a cause.</p>  
 <p>155. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that the existence of one of these three doctrines is inevitable:(156) Every single thing that is, <i>or</i> was, <i>or will</i> be in this world is all by his will, or <i>it</i> is not, (157) or there are <i>some</i> that are by his will <i>and</i> there are <i>some</i> that are not. 158. Because nothing whatever is found which is not good, or evil, or a mixture <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_862"><font size="1">1</font></a> of both.</p>  
 <p>159. If they say that all <i>things</i> are <i>by</i> his will, the good and evil are both his desire. 160. If good and evil are both his desire, <i>he</i> is not of perfect will; (161) <i>it</i> is not perfect even as to a single <i>thing</i>. 162. And he who is of imperfect will must be himself imperfect, (163) as is shown above <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>164. If nothing <i>be by</i> his will, (165) on account of nothing being <i>by</i> the will there is no will. 166. He <i>in</i> whom there is no will is working constitutionally <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (167) and he who is working constitutionally is constituted <i>and</i> made.</p>  
 <p>168. If there be <i>some things</i> which are <i>by</i> his will, <i>and</i> there be <i>some</i> which are not <i>by</i> his will, (169) <i>and</i> nothing is found in the world which is not good and not evil, (170) <i>from</i> that <i>it</i> is known <i>that</i>, if the sacred being <i>be of</i> good will, <i>he</i> is not desirous of that evil of it, (171) and that which is evil is not by his will. 172. If his will <i>be</i> evil <i>he</i> is inevitably not desirous of that good of it, (173) <i>and</i> that which is good is not by his will. 174. If that which is good <i>be by</i> the will of the sacred being, <i>it</i> is known <i>that</i> that which is evil arose from another will. 175. If that which is evil <i>be by</i> his will, that which is good arose inevitably from another will. 176. <i>And</i> the inevitability <i>of</i> a rival <i>of</i> the will of the sacred being is manifest.</p>  
 <p>177. If <i>one</i> says the evil springs from mankind, (178) that <i>implies</i> the inevitabilitysince mankind is not perpetually a self-existence<i>that</i> evil either arose before mankind, or after, (179) or it arose with mankind. 180. If they say it arose before mankind, (181) that <i>implies</i>since, apart from the sacred being, <i>there</i> was no other creator and producer (182) <i>that</i> either the sacred being produced that evil, or it produced its own existence itself, or it was itself eternal. 183. If they say it arose after mankind, (184) <i>as to</i> that, when human nature is likewise a production of the sacred being, (185) and the sacred being did not produce evil in the nature of mankind, (186) how has it sprung into action from them? 187. If the evil <i>was</i> set in action by them, apart from the will of the sacred being, (188) and a knowledge, as to <i>their</i> setting about it, existed <i>in</i></p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>the sacred being, (189) that <i>implies that</i> the sacred being is imperfect in his own will, (190) and mankind are victorious and triumphant in setting aside the will <i>and</i> command of the sacred being, and doing the evil competing <i>with</i> the will of the sacred being. 191. Also the power of the sacred being in his own will and his own servants is manifestly unprevailing. 192. If they say that he makes them proceed afterwards to the awful punishment of hell, (193) <i>as to</i> that <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">1</font></a>, if the sacred being <i>be</i> a powerful doer, <i>and</i> not to allow the committal of crime, <i>but</i> to convey <i>it</i> away from their minds, <i>be</i> more advantageous <i>and</i> more adapted to the compassion of a sacred being than <i>if</i> he allowed the committal, (194) <i>yet he has</i> become helplessly contented with it, (195) <i>and</i>, afterwards, contentedly punishes his own creatures, (196) <i>then</i>, as to the one matter I am well considering, either incapability, or scanty knowledge, or scanty goodness is thereby manifested.</p>  
 <p>197. If they say that the sacred being produced and created evil for the reason that so mankind <i>may</i> fully understand the value of goodness, (198) <i>as to</i> that you should observe that, if evil <i>be</i> requisite and advantageous for understanding goodness, that evil exists <i>by</i> his good will. 199. <i>And</i> if evil exists <i>by</i> his good will, and is requisite <i>and</i> advantageous for him <i>of</i> whom they say that evil is not his wish, <i>it</i> is inconsistent.</p>  
 <p>200. <i>As to</i> that also which they say, that death, pain, <i>and</i> poverty <i>are</i> produced by him for the reason that so mankind <i>may</i> much better understand the value of life, health, and opulence, (201) <i>and</i> become more grateful unto the sacred being, (202) <i>as to</i> that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>you should observe that <i>it</i> is as <i>it were</i> acting unreasonably, in the mode of him who gives poison to mankind for the sake of increasing the value <i>and</i> price of an antidote, (203) so that he <i>may</i> sell the antidote dearer <i>and</i> more costly. 204. To what is this intermeddling action owing, that, for the sake of an understanding of the value of the goodness of other <i>things</i>, he allows pain, death, <i>and</i> misery in some one else?</p>  
 <p>205. Again, <i>as to</i> that which a multitude of them say, that the sacred being is a ruler over every creature and creation, (206) because his creations are all his own. 207. <i>And</i> he acts about them as is desirable for him, because it is desirable for him, <i>and he</i> is not a causer of distress. 208. Since distress is that which they inflict upon anything that is not their own, (209) then the who, all things <i>being</i> his own, acts about them as is desirable for him, is not a causer of distress <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 210. <i>As to</i> that you should know that, if, on account of sovereignty, he who occasions distress is not to be called a causer of distress, (211) that is <i>as though</i> even he who is a sovereign <i>and</i> tells a lie is speaking truthfully, (212) and he who, on account of sovereignty, commits crime, sin, theft, <i>and</i> plunder is not to be called a sinner. 213. Such as that which the glorified Rôshan <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">2</font></a>, son of Âtûr-frôbag, related as a parable (ângunî-aîtak), (214) that they saw a man who was defiling an ass, (215) when they enquired of him</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>thus: 'Why dost thou commit this execrable action?' 216. And he spoke thus, in excuse: 'The ass is my own.'</p>  
 <p>217. Again, you should ask this of them, (218) that is: 'Is the sacred being a friend, or an enemy, to these creatures and creations which are made by him?' 219. If <i>he be</i> a friend of the creatures, that <i>implies that</i> it is not proper for him to desire <i>and</i> to produce the evil <i>and</i> misery of the creatures; (220) <i>yet</i>, as regards the devastation and misery of his own achievements, <i>he has</i> never even become tired of them. 221. If <i>he be</i> an enemy of the creatures, that <i>implies that</i> it is not proper for him to create <i>and</i> produce, through his own competent knowledge, that thing which is his enemy <i>and</i> disablement <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and struggles against his will.</p>  
 <p>222. This, too, you should ask, (223) that is: 'Is the sacred being always a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (224) or an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress? 225. Or is there a time when <i>he is</i> a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity, (226) and is there a time when <i>he is</i> an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress?'</p>  
 <p>227. If <i>he be</i> always a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity, (228) that <i>implies that</i> there are not, in his country <i>and</i> sovereignty, <i>any</i> oppression, distress, and complaint; (229) and his affection <i>for</i> the creatures and the affection of the creatures for him are pure. 230. Owing to the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>same reason <i>he is</i> merciful as regards his own creatures, (231) and his creatures are recounting <i>his</i> praise, utterers of thanksgivings <i>and</i> pure friends towards him. 232. His title of divinity, moreover, is worthily his own.</p>  
 <p>233. If <i>he be</i> an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress, (234) that <i>implies that he is</i> himself a pure <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">1</font></a> enemy to the creatures, and his creatures are also <i>of</i> a like nature towards him. 235. Owing to the same reason <i>he is</i> an injurer, destroyer, <i>and</i> deluder of the creatures, (236) and his creatures are complainers of him, strugglers concerning him, <i>and</i> pure enemies. 237. His title of divinity, moreover, is the equivalent of an unworthy name; (238) and, even on account of his eternity, the creatures are hopeless of becoming free from the risk of distress and misery for an unlimited time.</p>  
 <p>239. If there be a time when <i>he is</i> a good sovereign, well-understanding, <i>and</i> occasioning prosperity, and there be a time when <i>he</i> is turned away from this; (240) that <i>implies that</i> his affection for the creatures is mingled. 241. From a mingled affection <i>arises</i> mingled action, (242) <i>and</i> from mingled action a mingled individuality is also manifested. 243. And his creatures also are mingled friends to him. 244. Of <i>one's</i> associates <i>there</i> is none who, if a friend, is not one's enemy, no praiser who is not complaining of one, no glorifier even who is not scorning one; a character of this description is manifest among all creatures.</p>  
 <p>245. Again, <i>observe</i> this, that since all things which are in the world are not outside of these two terms,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>good and evil, (246) that <i>implies</i>, if good and evil are both said <i>to arise</i> from the sacred being and through the will of the sacred being, (247) <i>that</i> the troublesome Aharman is unreasonably defamed; <i>that, being</i> innocent <i>and</i> without an original evolution, he never was, nor <i>will</i> be, evil and headstrong <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 248. That which is mentioned in scripture (nipîk) <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that Aharman became headstrong, and was put out of heaven by them, is unreasonable, (249) because even that headstrongness <i>and</i> disobedience <i>were</i> likewise through the will of the sacred being.</p>  
 <p>250. If even it be said <i>that</i> the good <i>arises</i> from the sacred being and through the will of the sacred being, <i>and</i> the evil from mankind, still Aharman is without an original evolution <i>and</i> innocent, and curses <i>and</i> scorn for him are unreasonable. 251. If all this misery and evil <i>be</i> sent down, not from a different nature, but from the individuality and individual nature of the sacred being himself, (252) that <i>implies that</i> the sacred being is an enemy <i>and</i> adversary to his own tendencies (rûn).</p>  
 <p>253. <i>Observe</i> this, too, that to speak of the existence of criminality apart from a nature of crime is very deluding; (254) <i>and</i> as <i>it</i> is deluding to imagine a nature of crime that is good, <i>is it</i> more deluding to imagine Aharmanwho is the origin <i>and</i> original evolution of every crime<i>apart</i> from the creation and achievement of the sacred being?</p>  
 <p>255. The conclusion is this, that if <i>at</i> first there be anything which is not within the will of the sacred being, provided everything be through the will of the sacred being, no one whatever is a sinner; (256)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>and the apostle <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">1</font></a> and religion <i>were</i> appointed without a purpose. 257. If it be expedient to ruin any one for sinfulness, it is more expedient to ruin him who is the original doer, maintainer, and creator of every evil and crime. 258. And if it be said <i>that</i> evil and crime <i>arise</i> from Aharman or mankind, that <i>implies</i>, as they are likewise created and produced <i>by</i> the sacred being, <i>that</i> he is the source of them; in like manner, he who is the cause of the origin of evil (259) is worse than evil.</p>  
 <p>260. This, too, you should observe, that sects (kêshân) of every kind assert this <i>maxim</i>, handed down by their own high-priests, when <i>it</i> is mentioned and prescribed by them to their own congregation (ram), that is: 'Perform good works <i>and</i> abstain from crime.' 261. On account of delusion they do not consider this, that is, from where and what origin ought the crime to arise, about which <i>it</i> is thus commanded: 'Ye shall not commit <i>it, and</i> I <i>will</i> cast <i>him</i> who commits <i>it</i> into eternal hell.' 262. So that, if <i>that</i> same <i>be</i> owing to the sacred being, it would be easier for him not to produce it, than, after <i>its</i> production, <i>to have</i> brought <i>it</i> to notice and commanded <i>us</i> to abstain from it. 263. So far, indeed, I do not understand any advantage and motive <i>in</i> the production and creation of evil.</p>  
 <p>264. Again, in their scriptures, he speaks inconsistently about good works and crime (265) thus: 'Good works and crime are both owing to me. 266. Neither demons, nor wizards, are unrestricted in causing the ruin of any one. 267. No one <i>has</i> accepted the religion <i>and</i> done good works, and no one <i>has</i> walked in infidelity <i>and</i> committed crime, except through my will.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 268. In the same scripture he adduces many <i>things</i> which <i>one has</i> to connect, and inflicts curses on the creatures, (269) thus: 'Why do mankind desire <i>and</i> commit that crime which I design for them?' 270. It occurs concerning the will and work of his own hand, and <i>yet</i> he frightens them with punishment in body and soul. 271. <i>In</i> another place he speaks thus: 'I myself am the deluder of mankind, for if it should be my will they <i>would</i> then be shown the true path by me, but <i>it is</i> my will that they go to hell <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 272. And <i>in</i> another place he speaks thus: 'Man himself is the causer of crime.'</p>  
 <p>273. In these three modes the sacred being gives evidence of different kinds about his own creatures. 274. One is this, that <i>he</i> himself is Aharman <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">2</font></a>; (275) one is this, that he is himself the deluder of the creatures <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (276) <i>and</i>, in the other, he makes his own creatures confederates involved with Aharman in deluding <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">4</font></a>; so that <i>he implies:</i> 'There are <i>instances</i> when I occasion <i>it, and</i> there are <i>instances</i> when Aharman <i>does</i>.'</p>  
 <p>277. Through that <i>which</i> he states, that mankind themselves occasion crime, they are made by him confederates with Aharman; <i>he</i> himself <i>being</i> at a distance from the crime. 278. For if mankind commit crime owing to their own nature and their own delusion, that <i>implies that</i> the sacred being, with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Aharman, is far from the criminality, (279) because <i>it is</i> as <i>it were</i> not owing to the sacred being, nor yet owing to Aharman.</p>  
 <p>280. Again, you should ask of those whom they call Mûtazalîk <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">1</font></a> (281) thus: 'Is <i>it</i> the will of the sacred being <i>for</i> all mankind to abstain from crime through <i>their own</i> free will <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to escape from hell, <i>and</i> to make <i>them</i> proceed to heaven, or not?' 282. If <i>one</i> says that <i>it is</i> not, (283) that <i>implies that</i> an <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">3</font></a> opinion is formed by him as to the little goodness of the sacred being <i>and</i> the evil of his will; (284) <i>and</i>, for the same reason, <i>it</i> is not fitting to glorify <i>him</i> as the divine existence. 285. If <i>one</i> says that <i>it is</i> his will, (286) that <i>implies that</i> an opinion is formed by him as to the good will of the sacred being; (287) <i>and</i>, for the same reason, <i>it</i> is fitting to glorify <i>him</i> as the divine existence.</p>  
 <p>288. <i>Ask</i> this, too, that is: 'If <i>it be</i> his will, is <i>he</i> capable of performing <i>it</i>, or not?' 289. If <i>one</i> says that <i>he is</i> not, (290) that <i>implies that</i> an opinion is formed by him as to the incapability of the sacred being as regards that will of his; (291) <i>and</i>, for the same reason, <i>it</i> is not fitting to glorify <i>him</i> as the divine existence which is almighty. 292. If <i>one</i> says that <i>he</i> is capable of performing <i>his</i> will, (293) that <i>implies that</i> an opinion is formed by him as to <i>his</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>capability for that will of his; (294) <i>and</i>, for the same reason, <i>it</i> is fitting to glorify <i>him</i> as the divine existence which is almighty.</p>  
 <p>295. Again, <i>ask</i> this, that is: 'When <i>he</i> is capable of performing his will, does he perform <i>it</i>, or not?' 296. If <i>one</i> says that he performs <i>it</i>, (297) that <i>implies that</i> the abstaining from sin, escaping from hell, and bringing to heaven <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">1</font></a> would be manifested unto all mankind; (298) <i>but</i> this is that which is not manifest by his existence, and is falsifying even his own revelation (dînŏ). 299. If <i>one</i> says that <i>he</i> is capable of performing his will, but does not perform <i>it</i>, (300) that <i>implies that</i> an opinion is formed by him as to the unmercifulness of the sacred being, <i>his</i> enmity to mankind, and the inconstancy of his will. 301. For if he performs <i>it, it</i> is no harm to him himself and is an advantage <i>to</i> mankind; his own will is also continuous thereby. 302. <i>But</i> if he does not perform <i>it, it</i> is no advantage to him himself and, is harm <i>to</i> mankind; his own will is also discontinuous thereby.</p>  
 <p>303. Again, <i>ask</i> this, that is: 'Does he not perform <i>it</i> through will, or without will?' 304. If <i>one</i> says that he does not perform <i>it</i> through will, (305) that <i>implies that</i> an opinion is formed by him that the sacred being is good-willed, <i>but</i> has no will to do good; (306) <i>and</i> this is even to consider <i>him</i> faulty through inconsistency. 307. If <i>one</i> says that <i>he</i> is without will, <i>and</i> therefore does not perform <i>it</i>, (308) <i>that implies</i> that an opinion is formed by him as to the weakness of the sacred being in his own self, or the existence of an injurer of his will.</p>  
 <p>309. The conclusion is this, that, <i>with</i> a manager</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>of this worldly <i>existence</i> who may be without an opponent, without competition, and perfect in sagacity, goodness, and capability, <i>there</i> should not be all these unworthy actions, trouble and misery, pain and vexation, especially of mankind and the other creatures. 310. Because, when a manager, without an opponent, is perfect in sagacity, he knows means for evil not to occur and also remedies for carrying off evil. 311. When <i>he</i> is perfect in goodness and merciful, <i>he has</i> no wish for the occurrence of evil at first, <i>but</i> a wish for <i>its</i> extinction. 312. When <i>he</i> is perfect in capability, <i>he</i> is capable of not really becoming equally the origin of evil.</p>  
 <p>313. Now, as in the worldly <i>existence</i>, whose manager is the sacred being, the existence of evil is unquestionably visible, then thus much is not separable from this, either where the manager is <i>provided</i> with an opponent, or is without an opponent:314. If he does not know means for evil not to occur, and remedies for carrying off evil, the imperfect sagacity of the sacred being is thereby <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">1</font></a> manifested. 315. Or the evil exists <i>with</i> his good will, <i>and</i> the imperfect goodness of his will is manifested. 316. Or <i>he</i> is not capable of not <i>allowing</i> the occurrence of evil, and of carrying <i>it</i> off, <i>and</i> the imperfect capability of the sacred being is manifested. 317. And when <i>he</i> is imperfect even <i>in</i> onein sagacity, or goodness, or capability<i>it</i> is not fitting to glorify <i>and</i> worship <i>him</i> as the divine existence who is almighty, all-good, <i>and</i> all-wise.</p>  
 <p>318. This, too, you should know, that since any existing thing, which is acting, is <i>provided</i> with a will, but <i>its</i> nature <i>has</i> not become unrestricted, (319) that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>shows that</i>, if the original existence of the creator <i>be</i> divinity, and his nature <i>be</i> light <i>and</i> beauty, fragrance and purity, goodness and sagacity, then such <i>things</i> as darkness and ugliness, stench <i>and</i> pollution, vileness <i>and</i> ignorancethe demoniacal nature itselfought to be far from him. 320. If his original existence <i>be</i> anything demoniacal, and his nature <i>be</i> darkness <i>or</i> stench, ugliness <i>or</i> pollution, vileness <i>or</i> ignorance, then the nature of divinity remains strange to him.</p>  
 <p>321. If there be <i>any</i> one by whom indecision about all this is insinuated into his own self, that <i>implies that</i>, owing to his indecision about it, there is no discrimination <i>in</i> him as to goodness, amid his own evil. 322. Now, moreover, the hope of the hopeful is absorbed, (323) for even he who goes to heaven through doing good works is, even there, in evil and misery, (324) because there is no distinct discrimination of good from evil, even there, (325) if there be the goodness which is devoid of evil, <i>and</i> there be also the evil which is devoid of goodness, represented <i>as</i> really of the same origin. 326. This is known, that the difference of good and evil is owing to difference of nature. 327. When the two origins of their difference and distinction from the other of different nature are manifest, that hope of the hopeful is just, (328) and sagacity is their passport (parvânak).</p>  
 <p>329. This, too, you should know, that every statement which is not unconfused by its own limits is unenquiring (apa<i>d</i>-khvâh) <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 330. Likewise this, that the limit of divinity is specially sagacity. 331. <i>And</i> also this, that <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">2</font></a> the limit of sagacity is only <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>advantageous action. 332. Advantageous action is not doing injury; (333) <i>and</i> the modes of doing injury are three. 334. One is that which, <i>being</i> no advantage to oneself, is the injury of another also. 335. [One is that which, <i>being</i> no advantage to another <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">1</font></a>], is the injury of oneself also. 336. <i>And</i> one is that which is the injury of oneself and the injury of another also. 337. And from the creation of Aharman and the demons <i>there</i> is no advantage <i>to</i> a wisely-acting sacred being himself, <i>and there is</i> injury of others also; (338) the non-advancement of even his own will, owing to his own work, is always manifested thereby.</p>  
 <p>339. This, too, <i>you should know</i>, that if the will of the sacred being <i>be</i> goodness, (340) his will is also eternal. 341. And he should be capable of a suitable will, (342) so that, from the beginning even to the end, all the goodness <i>and</i> virtue of the will of the sacred being would have proceeded in the world. 343. Now <i>it</i> is manifest that vileness and vice always proceed much more. 344. Therefore <i>the cause</i> is one of these, either they always proceed through the will of the sacred being, or without <i>his</i> will. 345. If they always proceed through some will of the sacred being, <i>it</i> is evident that his will is also for vileness as well as for goodness, (346) or <i>he</i> is inefficient and changeable in will. 347. Since a will does not change, unless owing to a cause, or unless owing to a changer, (348) that <i>implies</i> one of these two, either <i>it</i> is through some cause, or there exists some other <i>being with</i> him as a changer of his will. 349 If they always proceed not through the will of the sacred being, (350) <i>from</i> that <i>it</i> is evident that the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacred being is suffering in his own will, and his will is not perfect, (351) or there exists some diminisher of it who is a possessor <i>of</i> will.</p>  
 <p>352. <i>As to</i> this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being commanded Adam thus: 'Thou shalt not eat of this one tree which is in paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t) <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' (353) you should ask of them (354) thus: 'Was the command which the sacred being gave to Adam, thus: "You shall not eat of this tree," good or evil?' 355. If the command were good <i>it</i> is evident that the tree was evil; (356) <i>and</i> it is not befitting the sacred being to create anything that is evil. 357. If the tree were good the command was evil, <i>and</i> it is not befitting the sacred being to give an evil command. 358. If the tree were good, and the command as to not eating <i>were</i> given by him, it is not <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">2</font></a> adapted to the goodness and mercifulness of the sacred being to allot a benefit <i>away</i> from his own innocent servants.</p>  
 <p>359. <i>As to</i> this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being brings every one whom he wills unto faith and the true way, and, as the recompense, he makes him proceed to the happy progress which is eternal; (360) <i>and</i> him whom he does not will he leaves in irreligion and ignorance of the sacred being, and, for that reason, he casts him into hell and eternal misery <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (361) you should ask of them (362) thus: 'Is he good whose desire and will are for the religion and faith of the sacred being and the true way, or he whose desire and will are for going astray, irreligion, and ignorance of the sacred being?' 363. If <i>one</i> says that he is good whose desire and will</p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p>are for the religion of the sacred being and the true way, (364) now <i>as to</i> that man about whom this is the will of the sacred being, that he <i>shall</i> leave him in irreligion, going astray, and ignorance of the sacred being, <i>and to whom</i> an apostle, or <i>some</i> other person who is a friend, recites the revelation (dînô) of the sacred being and the true way, (365) <i>does</i> that <i>show that</i> the sacred being is thereby better and more beneficial to him, or are that apostle <i>and</i> that person <i>so?</i> 366. If <i>one</i> says that the will of the sacred being about him <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">1</font></a> is good, it is thereby asserted by him, that not understanding the sacred being, not accepting the religion, and going astray are good; <i>but</i> this is not acceptable [and not to be taught <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">2</font></a>], on account of error. 367. If <i>one</i> says that his coming to the true religion and understanding the sacred being are thereby better and more beneficial, (368) it is thereby obviously asserted by one that the apostle and person are thereby better to him than the sacred being. 369. Because a person <i>through</i> whom the true way and an understanding of the sacred being are wanted among mankind, and his will is <i>bent</i> upon it, is much better than he who is a sacred being (370) <i>by</i> whose will backsliding (a<i>v</i>â<i>z</i>râsîh), misunderstanding, and irreligion <i>exist</i> among them; <i>and</i> the sacred being is much worse than that person.</p>  
 <p>371. <i>Observe</i> this, too, that if the criminal thought and criminal action of man are by the will of the sacred being, that already <i>implies</i> that the sacred being produced criminal thought, and sowed crime</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>in his mind, (372) and Aharman merely invites and instigates him to the committal of crime; that <i>shows that</i> the criminal thought <i>traced to</i> the sacred being and also his desire for it are more violent and worse than the invitation of Aharman. 373. When, too, his listening to <i>what proceeds</i> from Aharman, <i>as to</i> the committal of crime, is likewise due to the criminal thought which the sacred being produced, and <i>so</i> also <i>is</i> his desire for it, <i>it</i> is already obvious that the sacred being is much worse and more sinful than Aharman.</p>  
 <p>374. As regards these statements, which are enumerated by us, (375) one of these two <i>opinions</i> must arise, (376) either that all are true or that all are false, (377) or there are <i>some</i> which are true and there are <i>some</i> which are false. 378. If all <i>be</i> true, every statement that is not adapted to these statements is false, <i>or</i> something <i>of</i> the two, truth and falsehood. 379. If all <i>be</i> false, every statement that is not adapted to these statements is true, <i>or</i> something <i>of</i> the two together <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 380. If there be <i>some</i> that are true and there be <i>some</i> that are false, (381) then of those which are true<i>derived</i> from the nature and nucleus (nâf) of truth(382) and of those which are false<i>derived</i> from the nature and nucleus and original evolution of falsehood(383) the origins are two, one from which <i>arises</i> truth, <i>and</i> one <i>from</i> which <i>arises</i> falsehood.</p>
