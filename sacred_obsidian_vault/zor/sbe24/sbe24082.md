 <p>1. Again, about the inconsistency of their assertions <i>there</i> are several statements from the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>manuscript, (2) <i>as to</i> that which they say, that the sacred being is around everything, <i>but</i> nothing is within him; (3) and within everything, <i>but</i> nothing is around him. 4. <i>That he</i> is above everything, <i>but</i> nothing is below him; (5) and below everything, <i>but</i> nothing is above him. 6. <i>That</i> he sits upon a throne, <i>but</i> is possessing no <i>resting-</i>place; (7) and is inside heaven, <i>but</i> is possessing no whereabouts. 8. <i>That</i> he does not exist in any place, and <i>yet</i> he does exist <i>there</i>. 9. <i>That</i> he exists everywhere, and <i>yet</i> his place does not exist. 10. Also <i>that</i> everything of his becomes <i>fit</i> for his own by his own will, (11) <i>his</i> original evolution <i>being both</i> malice and good; (12) and <i>he is</i> eternally unforgiving and compassionate, (13) preparing distress and not distressing. 14. Likewise <i>that</i> he <i>has</i> commanded him who is incapable of performing <i>or</i> neglecting the divine command, (15) and he <i>has</i> created him who is innocent for hell, not the distresser. 16. <i>That he is</i> aware of the hellish existence of mankind, owing to wickedness, and his will is for it; (17) and <i>he is</i> good-willed, or it <i>has</i> become not his will. 18. <i>That</i> he <i>has</i> produced a remedy, and is not himself distressing; (19) or no remedy, but want of remedy, is produced by him, <i>and yet he is</i> not possessing an opponent. 20. <i>That he is</i> wanting experience, and <i>yet</i> omniscient; (21) neglecting commands, and <i>yet</i></p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>they are</i> themselves his will; (22) and he who neglects, <i>and</i> provides a restricted evolution <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is <i>yet</i> a good sovereign. 23. Also <i>that</i> his commands are all continuous, (24) and <i>yet</i> the setting aside of his commands is obtainable. 25. And <i>that</i> there is <i>some</i> of his will which is not continuous, (26) and neglect of his will is not an injurer of the will. 27. Likewise <i>that</i> he <i>has</i> commanded that which is not his will, (28) and the command <i>which is</i> not inconsistent with his will <i>and</i> also the command <i>which is</i> inconsistent with his will are both proper. 29. Also <i>that</i> his good will is not a discontinuous will, (30) and <i>as to</i> his evil will, which makes evil things, that is judicious. 31. And many other inconsistencies which are in the assertions of <i>various</i> sects.</p>  
 <p>32. If it be not possible for an orderly (pa<i>d</i>mânîk) religion to exist, without rescue from these inconsistent assertions of many kinds, (33) they then <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">2</font></a> say this of it, that <i>to</i> the supposers of two original evolutions <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">3</font></a> the work of the sacred being is weak and unresisting; (34) <i>and</i> they say <i>it</i> is not as <i>it were</i> adapted to the grandeur of the sacred being.</p>  
 <p>35. Upon this subject, too, there are <i>some matters</i>, which I <i>shall</i> clearly state, <i>that</i> should be dictated <i>and</i> known. 36. That is, does he <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">4</font></a> make divine things weaker and more unresisting, (37) where <i>it is he</i> who says that <i>the sacred being's</i> own achievements,</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>which <i>were</i> created by him, have all lapsed into <i>being</i> intolerant of command <i>and</i> deaf to admonition, (38) till even the most tender-bodied creatures struggle against his will? 39. And so <i>they have</i> slain <i>or</i> impaled those many prophets (vakhshvarân) <i>and</i> apostles (pêtkhambarân) of his, who are appointed by him; (40) <i>and</i> there are <i>some</i> who <i>have</i> acted scornfully, contemptibly, and irreverently. 41. This, too, is where <i>he has</i> not only not protected his own dominion from the vile <i>creatures</i> which <i>were</i> created by him himself, but <i>he has</i> himself afflicted his own dominion also; (42) and he himself destroys his own productions without a reason, (43) and himself renders his own creations useless. 44. Through his own culpability he himself destroys his own innocent servants. 45. He himself makes his own peculiar friends weak, needy, sinful, and deluded. 46. And <i>his</i> wrath, <i>inflicted</i> upon a single innocent servant, which is like Aharman's <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">1</font></a>, makes his own innumerable creatures unobservant <i>and</i> deluded. 47. For a sin that is limited, which is owing to his own actions, he puts the innocent to unlimited punishment <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 48. The door of forgiveness is finally shut up, (49) and he is not satiated with the pain, distress, and misery of his own creatures, (50) <i>but</i> maintains <i>them</i> perpetually in action and excitement. 51. And <i>yet</i> he is not able to insist upon the commands which he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>gives <i>in</i> the beginning, middle, <i>or</i> end. 52. Or is <i>it</i> he <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">1</font></a> who says that that <i>one</i> is the sacred being who is perpetually a ruler, all-knowing and almighty; (53) whose dominion and knowledge and power are perpetual <i>and</i> for unlimited time? 54. Owing to him, too, is the happiness of any goodness; (55) his actions also are for a purpose, <i>his</i> commands are advantageous, (56) <i>he is</i> compassionate and forgiving as regards his own servants, (57) and is an abundant bestower of recompense, too, <i>on</i> that servant who is a carrier <i>off</i> of victory. 58. As to him who is a sinner, who, on account of his own sinfulness, becomes captive <i>in</i> the hands of the enemy <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>he is</i> forgiving upon atonement <i>for</i> the sinfulness and cleansing from iniquity and pollution. 59. <i>In</i> the end <i>he</i> is no leaver of any good creature captive in the hands of enemies <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (60) and is heir protector, maintainer, and cherisher, in body and life, amid <i>their</i> contest and struggle with enemies. 61. <i>He is</i> a complete defender of his own empire from opponents of a different nature, (62) and his champions and troops become victorious in the struggle and contest. 63. <i>And</i> in the end <i>he is</i> a bringer of victory <i>to</i> his own creatures, as regards every iniquity.</p>  
 <p>64. When it is observed <i>as</i> to light, knowledge, sight, life, health, <i>and</i> other divine creations, that <i>they</i> are fully resistant and prevailing over darkness,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>ignorance, blindness, death, sickness, <i>and</i> other demoniacal peculiarities(65) because this is known, that light is the putting aside of all darkness, (66) knowledge is victorious over ignorance, (67) and life is powerful <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">1</font></a> and increasing over death, (68) for, owing to the powerfulness and increase of life, the incalculable progress of the creatures arises from two persons, (69) and multitudes are confident about it; (70) so also sight and health are manifestly as much victorious and powerful over blindness and sickness (71) <i>such being observed</i>, it is also expedient to observe this, that is, what does the opposing fiend want, <i>and</i> about what do the troops of the sacred being struggle?</p>  
 <p>72. That opponent wants this <i>that he speaks of</i> thus: 'I <i>will</i> make this earth and sky and the creatures which are luminaries <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">2</font></a> extinct, (73) or I <i>will</i> bring <i>them</i> into <i>my</i> possession, <i>and will</i> pervert <i>them</i> from their own nature <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (74) so that the sacred being shall not be able to occasion the resurrection and the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, and to restore his own creatures.'</p>  
 <p>75. The troops of the sacred being struggle about this, that the opponent shall not attain to <i>his</i> will through <i>his</i> desire. 76. <i>Observe</i> this, too, that the troops of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>have been</i> valiant in struggling and successful in will <i>ever</i> since the original creation.</p>  
 <p>77. From this <i>it</i> is manifest, when it happens <i>that</i> this earth and sky are formed, (78) that it <i>would be</i> possible for him to make all creatures and creations extinct; but <i>he</i> is incapable of making even one of the most tender-bodied creatures of the sacred being</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>extinct. 79. Because, if even, by reason of death, the body be separated from life, <i>it</i> is not extinction and change of nature from its own self, but decay <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">1</font></a> of peculiarities and a necessity of <i>going</i> from place to place, from duty to duty <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 80. Then each one of the qualities of one's body <i>and</i> life is to subsist again, in its own nature, for other duties, as is revealed. 81. And the existence of these creatures and creation, fully continuously <i>and</i> perpetually active, is advantageously manifest during a suitable period.</p>  
 <p>82. Thus far is considered complete upon this subject.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_893"></a><a href="sbe24082.htm#fr_901">202:2</a> See Chap. IV, 407. As the inconsistent statements which <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a> follow in the text are not to be found in the portion of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> known to be extant, they were probably contained in the first two books of that work, which have not yet been discovered. Chap. 132 of the third book (130 in Dastûr Peshotan's translation, pp. 176-178) is the nearest approach to our text in style, but not in matter. It is 'about him who is in all <i>and</i> over all, over and not lower than anything <i>nor</i> through anything, that is, even owing to management <i>he is</i> over all, and all is manageable by him.'</p>
