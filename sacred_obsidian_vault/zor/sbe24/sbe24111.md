 <p>1. The twenty-third subject is this, that it is requisite to restrain a tethered <i>animal</i> from misbehaviour, and to keep watch <i>over</i> one's own <i>creatures</i>, especially <i>at</i> the time when they have eaten meat.</p>  
 <p>2. Therefore, if they have eaten meat <i>and</i> they commit an assault, every offence that the animal (haîvân) commits may be that person's whose meat may be eaten. 3. For example, if a horse lashes <i>out</i> a kick (lakad) at any one, the offence may be that person's whose food may be eaten and caused the offence.</p>  
 <p>4. Therefore it is necessary to make an endeavour that they <i>shall</i> commit no offence whatever, especially at a time when they have eaten meat.</p>
