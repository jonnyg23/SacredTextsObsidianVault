 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is it possible to seek the maintenance and prosperity of the body [without injury of the soul, and the preservation of the soul without injury of the body <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a>]?'</p>  
 <p>3. The spirit of wisdom answered (4). thus: 'Him who is less than thee consider as an equal, and an equal as a superior, (5) and a greater than him as a chieftain <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and a chieftain as a ruler. 6. And among rulers <i>one</i> is to be acquiescent, obedient, and true-speaking; (7) <i>and</i> among accusers <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">4</font></a> be submissive, mild, and kindly regardful.</p>  
 <p>8. 'Commit no slander; (9) so that infamy and wickedness <i>may</i> not happen unto thee. 10. For it is said (11) that slander is more grievous than witchcraft; (12) and in hell the rush of every fiend <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">5</font></a> is to the front, <i>but</i> the rush of the fiend of slander, on account of the grievous sinfulness, is to the rear.</p>

 <p>demon of greediness <i>may</i> not deceive thee, (15) and the treasure of the world <i>may</i> not be tasteless to thee, and that of the spirit unperceived.</p>  
 <p>16. 'Indulge in no wrathfulness; (17) for a man, when he indulges in wrath, becomes then forgetful of his duty and good works, of prayer and the service of the sacred beings, (18) and sin and crime of every kind occur unto his mind, and <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a> until the subsiding of the wrath (19) he <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">2</font></a> is said <i>to be</i> just like Aharman <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>20. 'Suffer no anxiety; (21) for he who is a sufferer of anxiety becomes regardless of enjoyment of the world and the spirit, (22) and contraction happens to his body and soul.</p>  
 <p>23. 'Commit no lustfulness; (24) so that harm and regret <i>may</i> not reach thee from thine own actions.</p>  
 <p>25. 'Bear no improper envy; (26) so that thy life <i>may</i> not become tasteless.</p>  
 <p>27. 'Commit no sin on account of [disgrace] <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">4</font></a>; (28) because happiness and adornment <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">5</font></a>, celebrity (khanî<i>d</i>îh) and dominion, skill and suitability are not through the will and action of men, but through the appointment, destiny, and will of the sacred beings.</p>  
 <p>29. 'Practise no sloth; (30) so that the duty and good work, which it is necessary for thee to do, <i>may</i> not remain undone.</p>

 <p>42. 'Thou shouldst be (yehevûne<i>s</i>) diligent and moderate, (43) and eat of thine own regular industry, (44) and provide the share of the sacred beings and the good; (45) and, thus, the practice of this, in thy occupation, is the greatest good work.</p>  
 <p>46. 'Do not extort from the wealth of others; (47) so that thine own regular industry may <i>not</i> become unheeded. 48.

 <p>50. 'Thou shouldst be an abstainer from the wives of others; (51) because all these three would become disregarded by thee, alike wealth, alike <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">2</font></a> body, and alike <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">2</font></a> soul.</p>  
 <p>52. 'With enemies fight with equity. 53. With a friend proceed with the approval of friends. 54.

 <p>64. 'In thanksgiving unto the sacred beings, and worship, praise, ceremonies, invocation, and performing the learning of knowledge thou shouldst be energetic and life-expending. 65. For it is said (66) that: "In aid of the contingencies (<i>g</i>ahisnŏ) <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a> among men wisdom is good; (67) in seeking renown and preserving the soul liberality is good; (68) in the advancement of business and justice complete mindfulness is good; (69) and in the statements of those who confess (khûstîvân) <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with a bearing on the custom of the law <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">3</font></a>, truth is good. 70.

XXIII, 6. The sin consists in talking while eating, praying, or at any other time when a murmured prayer (vâ<i>g</i>) has been taken inwardly and is not yet spoken out; the protective spell of the prayer being broken by such talking. If the prayer be not taken inwardly when it ought to be, the same sin is incurred (see Sls. V, 2, Dd. LXXIX, 8).</p>

XV, 25-29), would be when it interrupts eating and drinking. These archangels are personifications of Av. haurvatâ<i>d</i>, 'completeness or health,' and ameretâ<i>d</i>, 'immortality.'</p>

V, 25, 31); in later. writings, such as the Book of Dâdâr bin Dâd-dukht, he is said to throw a noose over the neck of the soul to drag it to hell, but if its good works have exceeded its sins, it throws off the noose and goes to heaven; and this noose is also mentioned in Bd. III, 22, Dd. XVIII, 3. In Bd. XXVIII, 35 this demon is said to be the same as the bad Vâê, but all other authorities consider them as distinct beings. It may be noted that a different demon of death is usually mentioned when the soul is wicked (see § 161).</p>

Just as the wind (vâ<i>d</i>) may be either an angel or a demon, according as its strength makes it a refreshing breeze or a violent hurricane, so may the air be a good or evil being, according as it retains its original purity or has been vitiated by the evil spirit. That the angel Vâê is the upper air appears from its epithet uparô-kairya, 'working aloft,' in the Râm Yt.; and that it is only the lower air that is vitiated by the evil spirit is in accordance with the division of the sky into three thirds, of which the uppermost is inaccessible to the evil spirit (see Dd. XXXVII, 24-31). But this distinction between a good and bad Vâê is not made in Vend. V, 25, 31, where we are told that Vayô conveys the soul when bound by Astô-vîdhôtu.</p>

XXXI, 14 as the spiritual representative of butter made during the Maidhyô-zaremaya, 'mid-verdure,' festival, which was considered the best of the year.
