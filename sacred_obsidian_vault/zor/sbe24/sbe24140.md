 <p>1. The fifty-second subject is this, that it is incumbent on every one that, every year <i>when</i> the month Fravardîn comes on, <i>he is</i> to provide a sacred cake <i>on</i> the day Khurdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1355"></a><a href="#fn_1344"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and whatever they are able to bring to hand, <i>a little</i> of everything, <i>they are</i> to place by that sacred cake, and to consecrate <i>it</i> with the dedicatory <i>formula</i> Ayaranãm<i>k</i>a <a name="fr_1356"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so that</p>

 <p>the affairs of that year may be better through that day's provision and the entry and coming in <i>of guests</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. For it is declared in revelation <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that, every year, when the day Khurdâ<i>d</i> of the month Fravardîn comes on, they allot a daily provision <i>for</i> mankind, and whatever <i>one</i> wishes to pass to the lot of mankind in that year they write down that day. 3. Therefore, when they shall consecrate this sacred cake, the archangel Khurdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">2</font></a> is making intercession for that person.</p>
