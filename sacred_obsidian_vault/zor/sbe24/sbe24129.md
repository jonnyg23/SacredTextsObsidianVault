 <p>1. The forty-first subject is this, that it is greatly requisite to avoid a menstruous woman, while they give <i>her</i> bread and food moderately. 2. As soon as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>she is not able to eat <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">1</font></a> they <i>should</i> not give <i>her</i> more, and <i>in</i> the same manner <i>as regards</i> water, on this account, that whatever remnant comes from that menstruous <i>woman</i> does not come to any use <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. When they wish to provide <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">3</font></a> bread they put the hand into the sleeve, or they place something on the top of the sleeve, <i>and</i> it is necessary that her bare hand <i>should</i> not come <i>forth</i> again in any place. 4. Because every drop of water that trickles on to a limb of a menstruous woman becomes a sin of three hundred stîrs <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5. And it is requisite <i>for</i> a menstruous woman to avoid everything that is washed <i>with</i> ceremony by fifteen steps. 6. It is <i>also</i> necessary <i>for her</i> to be <i>at least</i> three steps distant from a righteous man, and on whatever her eye casts a look it diminishes the glory <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">5</font></a> of that thing.</p>  
 <p>7. And on every woman the twelve ceremonials <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>atoning for</i> the offence of menstruation, are incumbent. 8. One on account of the offence that has occurred as regards the spiritual <i>existence</i> <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">7</font></a>. 9. The second on account of the offence that has occurred</p>

 <p>as regards the stars <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 10. The third on account of that which <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">2</font></a> has occurred as regards the sun. 11. The fourth on account of that which has occurred as regards the moon. 12. The fifth on account of that which has occurred as regards the spirit of fire. 13. The sixth on account of that which has occurred as regards the spirit of water. 14. The seventh on account of that which has occurred as regards the spirit of earth. 15. The eighth on account of that which has occurred as regards the spirit of the wind. 16. The ninth on account of that which has occurred as regards Khurdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 17. The tenth on account of the offence that has occurred as regards Ameredâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 18. The eleventh on account of the offence that has occurred as regards meal-time (<i>h</i>urdak gâh) <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 19. The twelfth on account of the offence that has occurred as regards bodily refuse <i>and</i> dead matter. 20. Therefore it is incumbent on every one <i>in</i> this manner <a name="fr_1316"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">5</font></a>; if any one be more opulent eighteen <i>ceremonials</i> are indispensable, and if she has silver in excess (ba-<i>gh</i>âyat) <i>there should be</i> twenty-one, <i>and in</i> one place I have read that twenty-four are indispensable; but, for lesser people, this that I have noted is necessary.</p>  
 <p>21. That which they provide in <i>their</i> lifetime is better <a name="fr_1317"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">6</font></a>; <i>and</i>, just as would occur when any one</p>

 <p>plants a tree anew, <i>and</i> is eating the fruit of it every year, even so much is that good work increasing every year. 22. If she shall live ten years, <i>or</i> if a hundred years, even so long it is becoming every year much more <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 23. If they provide <i>it</i> after her <i>lifetime</i>, that which would be the increase departs; and in <i>her</i> lifetime, also, that occurs which every one, who <i>has</i> done a duty on his own account, has seen, that <i>the thing</i> itself <i>which others</i> accomplish after his <i>lifetime</i> is very different; so that she <i>should</i> provide <i>it</i> with her own hands, not after her decease (vafât).</p>

The Hômâst consists of a Yasna each day for 144 days in honour of twelve angels, each angel being reverenced for twelve successive days. The angels are nearly the same as stated in the text, but the celebration of the Hômâst is twelve tines as long. The cost of this latter is said to be 350 rupis (see Byt. II, 59 n). Occasionally a still more onerous celebration is said to be incumbent on such women as can afford it (see Chap. LXVI).</p>
