 <p>1. Again, about the inconsistency and faulty statements of the first scripture <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (2) which they call holy (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>)(3) and as to it they are, <i>in</i> every way, unanimous that the sacred being wrote <i>it</i> with his own hand, <i>and</i> gave <i>it</i> to Moses (Mûshâê)(4) so that, as <i>it</i> is full of delusion, I <i>will</i> here publish, for your information, a story <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">4</font></a> out of all <i>its</i> stupidity and of much that is in it.</p>  
 <p>5. It states, in the beginning <i>of</i> the scripture, (6) that <i>there</i> first arose earth, without form and void <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">5</font></a>,</p>

 <p>darkness, and black water; (7) and the breathing <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the sacred being ever yearns <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">2</font></a> over the face of that black water <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 8. Afterwards the sacred being spoke thus: 'Let <i>there</i> be light,' (9) and <i>there</i> was light <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 10. And stooping he considered that light below him, (11) and the light <i>was</i> transmitted by him to the day, and the darkness to the night <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 12. In six days this world and sky <i>and</i> earth <i>were</i> also created by him, (13) for during the seventh day he was reposing (khaspân) and comfortable <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 14. Through that same mystery (râ<i>z</i>) even now the Jews are enjoying repose <i>on</i> the Sabbath day <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>15. This, too, <i>is stated</i>, that Adam and his wife Eve (Havâê) <i>were</i> created by him, (16) <i>and</i> put into a garden of paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t); (17) so that Adam</p>

 <p>should perform cultivation in that garden, and should keep watch <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 18. The Lord <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who is the sacred being himself, commanded Adam (19) thus: 'Eat of every tree which is in this garden, except of that tree of knowledge; (20) because when you eat thereof you die <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' 21. Afterwards a serpent <i>was</i> also put by him into the garden; (22) <i>and</i> that serpent deceived Eve <i>and</i> spoke thus: '<i>Let</i> us eat of the gathering from this tree, <i>and let</i> us give <i>it</i> to Adam <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' 23. And she acted accordingly, (24) and Adam likewise ate <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 25. And <i>his</i> knowledge became such that good <i>was</i> distinguished by him from evil, and they did not die <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 26. He also saw and knew that he was naked, (27) <i>and</i> became concealed under the trees; (28) he likewise covered over his own body <i>with</i> leaves of trees, on account of the shame of nakedness <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">7</font></a>. 29. Afterwards the Lord went to the</p>

 <p>garden, <i>and</i> called Adam by name thus: 'Where art thou <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">1</font></a>?' 30. Adam replied thus: 'Here I am, under the trees, for this reason, because I am naked <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' 31. The Lord indulged <i>in</i> wrath, (32) <i>and</i> spoke thus: 'Who could have informed <i>thee</i> that thou art naked? 33. Mayest thou not ever yet <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>have</i> eaten of that tree of knowledge, <i>of</i> which I said that you shall not eat <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">4</font></a>?' 34. Adam spoke thus: 'I have <i>been</i> deceived <i>by</i> this woman, who <i>was</i> given to me by thee, and I ate <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">5</font></a>.' 35. And the Lord enquired of Eve thus: 'Why <i>was</i> it so done by thee?' 36. Eve spoke thus: 'I have <i>been</i> deceived <i>by</i> this serpent <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">6</font></a>.' 37. And Adam and Eve and the serpent are, all three, forced out of the garden of paradise by him with a curse <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">7</font></a>. 38. And he spoke to Adam thus: 'Thy eating shall be through the scraping off of sweat <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>and the panting of the nostrils, (39) until the end of thy life; (40) and thy land shall grow all bodily refuse and dung <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 41. He also spoke to Eve thus: 'Thy pregnancy shall be in pain and uneasy, and thy bringing forth in grievous hastening <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' 42. And he spoke to the serpent thus: 'Thou shalt be accursed from amid the quadrupeds and wild animals of the plain and mountain; (43) for thee also <i>there</i> shall be no feet, (44) and thy movement shall be on <i>thy</i> belly, and <i>thy</i> food dust. 45. And betwixt thy offspring, with <i>those of</i> the woman, <i>there</i> shall be such hatred and conversion to enmity that they <i>will</i> wound the head of that offspring <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>46. This, too, they say, that this worldly <i>existence</i>, with whatever is in everything, was made and produced by him for mankind; (47) and man <i>was</i> made by him predominant over all creatures and creations, wet and dry <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>48. Now I <i>will</i> tell <i>you</i> a story (nisang-1) about</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>the contents of their twaddle and the faultiness of their statements, (49) that is, where and with what limits did that earth without form and void <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the darkness, the sacred being and his breathing <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the black water arise? 50. Or <i>of</i> what description was the sacred being himself? 51. <i>It is</i> manifest that he was not light, (52) because, when the light was seen by him, (53) stooping he considered <i>it</i> <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the reason that he had not seen it <i>before</i>. 54. If they say that he was dark, that manifestly <i>implies</i> that the origin of darkness is uttering <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">4</font></a> a word <i>and</i> there is light. 55. If they say that he was not dark, but light, (56) why, when the light <i>was</i> seen by him, did he admire <i>and</i> consider it, though he was light himself? 57. And if they say that he was neither light nor dark, (58) it is necessary for such to specify that third <i>state</i> which is not light and not dark.</p>  
 <p>59. Then <i>as to</i> him whose position and abode were in darkness and black water, and light was never seen by him, how was it possible for him to look <i>at</i> that light? 60. And what <i>was</i> his divinity owing to? 61. Because even now <i>it</i> is not possible for any one who remains in darkness to look <i>at</i> the light. 62. <i>Observe</i> also this, that if his origin and abode were darkness, how was it possible for him to remain opposite the light? 63. Because this is known, that <i>it</i> is not possible <i>for</i> darkness to remain opposite the light, since <i>the latter</i> puts it aside harmless.</p>  
 <p>64. Again, <i>I ask</i> this, that is, was that earth, which</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>was</i> without form and void, limited or unlimited? 65. If it were limited, what was there outside of it? 66. If it were unlimited, whither did that unlimitedness of it go, (67) when, as we see, this earth and worldly <i>existence</i> are not those of the first existence?</p>  
 <p>68. <i>As to</i> that which the Lord spoke, (69) that is: 'Let <i>there</i> be light,' and it was <i>so</i>, (70) it is thereupon appropriate to understand that the Lord <i>existed</i> before the <i>time</i> that the light arose; (71) <i>and</i> when he was wishing to make the light, and he gave the command for it to arise, he then considered mentally <i>in</i> what way the light is of good appearance or evil appearance. 72. And if the light, through its own nature, reached into the knowledge and consideration of the Lord, it is evident that the light was existing alike within the knowledge and mind of the Lord, (73) and alike outside of him. 74. For it is not possible to know and obtain anything, unless <i>it be</i> a manifestation of an existence. 75. If the light was existing is it <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">1</font></a>, on that account, a creation of the Lord? 76. And if they say that the light was not, through its own nature, within <i>his</i> knowledge, that light <i>was</i> demanded by him, who did not know of what nature <i>it was</i>, very unwisely. 77. Or how is it possible to consider in the mind that which one <i>has</i> never even thought of <i>or</i> known?</p>  
 <p>78. And <i>observe</i> this, too, that that command for the arising of light <i>was</i> given <i>either</i> to something or to nothing, (79) because this is certain, that it is necessary to give a command to a performer of commands. 80. If <i>it were</i> given by him to something existing, which <i>was</i> light, that <i>implies that</i> the light</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>itself existed. 81. And if the command <i>were</i> given by him, to something not existing, then how did the something not existing hear the command of the Lord? 82. Or how did it know that the will of the Lord <i>was</i> thus, that 'I <i>should</i> become light?' 83. Because the command of the Lord is not heard <i>by what</i> does not exist, in the same manner as though <i>it were</i> not given by him. 84. Since it is not possible <i>for</i> the non-existent even to think in any way, (85) <i>it was</i> that which is appointed nonexistent, so that it does not exist, but <i>yet</i> exists <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that was really before the sight of the sage <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">2</font></a>; by which <i>it was</i> known <i>in</i> what manner the Lord is demanding that it <i>shall</i> arise <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> in the manner which was demanded by him it arose.</p>  
 <p>86. If they say that the light arose from the word of the Lord, which <i>was</i> spoken by him thus: 'Thou shalt arise,' and it was <i>so</i>(87) that <i>being</i> when the Lord and his belongings (khû<i>d</i>îh) were dark, and light had really never <i>been</i> seen by him<i>in</i> what way is it possible <i>for</i> that light to arise from <i>his</i> word? 88. Because this is known, that speaking is the progeny of thinking. 89. If they say that his word became light, that is very marvellous, because then light is the fruit of darkness, and the source of darkness is thereby the essence of light;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>or <i>else it is</i> this, that the light was concealed in the darkness.</p>  
 <p>90. As I <i>have</i> said <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it is evident that it is of no use to give a command, except <i>to</i> a performer of commands, (91) so that it should be <i>that</i> the light existed, <i>and</i> then the command was expedient <i>and</i> given.</p>  
 <p>92. Again, <i>I ask</i> this, <i>as to</i> these creatures and creations, sky <i>and</i> earth of his, since <i>they were</i> prepared and produced by him in six days, (93) <i>and</i> the seventh he reposed (khaspî<i>d</i>) therefrom <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (94) then, when this world <i>was</i> not produced by him from anything, but merely arose by his command, 'thou shalt arise,' and it was <i>so</i>, (95) to what <i>was</i> that delay of his of six days owing? 96. For when his trouble is merely as much as to say 'thou shalt arise,' the existence of that delay of six days is very ill-seeming. 97. It is also not suitable for trouble to arise for him therefrom. 98. If it be possible to make the non-existent exist, and <i>he be</i> capable <i>of it</i>, it is possible to produce <i>it</i> even a long time back. 99. And if <i>he be</i> incapable of producing except in the period of a day, it is not fitting to speak of his producing it from nothing.</p>  
 <p>100. And, again, <i>I ask</i> this, that is, when the number of the days should be known from the sun, whence then is the number of the day, besides the names of the days, known before the creation of the sun? 101. For they say that the sun <i>was</i> produced by him <i>on</i> the fourth day, which is itself Wednesday <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p>102. <i>I</i> also <i>ask</i> this, to what <i>was it</i> owing that it was necessary for him to make <i>himself</i> comfortable <i>and</i> reposing <i>on</i> the seventh day? 103. When the delay and trouble in his creation and production of the world was <i>merely</i> so much as <i>that</i> he spoke thus: 'Thou shalt arise,' (104) how are those days accounted <i>for</i> by him, so that it was necessary to make him reposing whose trouble is recounted? 105. For if 'thou shalt arise' <i>were</i> spoken by him at once, that is his trouble, and he ought to become comfortable immediately.</p>  
 <p>106. Again <i>I ask</i> this, that is, for what purpose and cause is Adam produced by him, <i>together</i> with Eve <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (107) so that while they practise his will <a name="fr_957"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the purpose of it is not so presented by him that they shall not turn <i>away</i> from the performance of his desire? 108. For when it is known by him, before the fact, that they <i>will</i> not be listening <i>to</i> his command, and <i>yet they</i> are finally produced by him, that <i>shows that</i> for him now to become exhausted, and to indulge in wrath about them, is unreasonable, (109) because <i>it</i> is evident that the Lord himself was not fully proceeding <i>with that</i> which is desirable for his own will, and is manifestly an opponent and adversary to his own will. 110. If they are not understood by him before the fact, and it is not even known by him that they <i>will</i> not listen <i>to</i> his command, then he is ignorant and badly informed. 111. If they say that his will itself was for non-performance, why then is the command for performance given by him? 112. Also what is the sin in not performing</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>it, and how goes (113) a horse whom they yoke with <i>another</i> in confinement (lag) and hurry on with a whip (tâ<i>z</i>ânak) <a name="fr_958"></a><a href="#fn_950"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 114. From this statement signs and tokens of deceivers are manifested, (115) whose will and command are inconsistent <i>and</i> unadapted, one to the other.</p>  
 <p>116. And if his will and desire were this, that they <i>shall</i> not turn <i>away</i> from his will, (117) still their power and desire for turning <i>away</i> from his will are much stronger and more resistant than those which he <i>gave</i> for not turning. 118. If the will for their turning <i>away</i> from his will, and also the knowledge of it, were his, and the command for not turning <i>away were</i> given by him, how was it still possible <i>for</i> the distressed Adam <i>to act</i> so that they <i>should</i> not turn <i>away?</i> 119. Also, the origin and maintenance of his will ought not to exist, (120) because by turning <i>away</i> from his command <i>one</i> merely falsifies (drû<i>g</i>e<i>d</i>) it as a command, <i>while</i> by not turning <i>away</i> it becomes a falsification of both <i>his</i> will and knowledge.</p>  
 <p>121. Again, <i>I ask</i> this, that is, on what account and for what advantage <i>was</i> that garden, prepared by him, produced <a name="fr_959"></a><a href="#fn_951"><font size="1">2</font></a>? 122. And <i>as to</i> the tree of knowledge itself, about which he commanded thus: 'Ye shall not eat <i>of it</i>,' and also <i>as to</i> the injunction for not eating <i>of it</i>, which <i>was</i> issued by him, why was it necessary for him to make them?</p>  
 <p>123. <i>It</i> is also evident, from his injunction and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>command, that scanty knowledge and ignorance are more loved by him, (124) and <i>his</i> desire for them is more than <i>for</i> knowledge and wisdom. 125. And <i>that</i> even his advantage from ignorance was more, (126) because while the tree of knowledge was not tasted by them they were ignorant, and not disobedient and without benefit unto him, (127) <i>but</i> just as their knowledge arose they became disobedient unto him. 128. <i>There</i> was also no anxiety for him from their ignorance, <i>but</i> just as their knowledge arose (129) he became exhausted and wrathful about them, (130) and, forced out of paradise by him, with grievous discomfort and disgrace, they are cast <a name="fr_960"></a><a href="#fn_952"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the earth. (131) The sum total is this, that the cause of this birth of man's knowledge, in the worldly <i>existence</i>, was owing to the serpent and deceit.</p>  
 <p>132. They also say this, that things of every kind <i>were</i> created for mankindon account of which <i>it</i> is evident that even that tree <i>was</i> created by him for mankind(133) and man <i>was</i> made by him predominant over every creature and creation <a name="fr_961"></a><a href="#fn_953"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 134. If that be so, why <i>were they</i> now to incline <i>their</i> desires <i>away</i> from that tree which was their own?</p>  
 <p>135. From this <i>following</i> statement this, too, is evident, that knowledge was not really originating with him, (136) because if he came forth to the garden <a name="fr_962"></a><a href="#fn_954"><font size="1">3</font></a> and raised his voice, and called Adam by name thus: 'Where art thou,' <i>it</i> is just as though he were unaware of the place where he existed; (137) <i>and</i> if he had been unanswered by him, <i>he would have</i> been unaware of the place where Adam existed. 138. If it were not owing to his (a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>outcry, too, before seeing <i>him, he would have</i> been unaware that he <i>had</i> eaten of that tree, or not; <i>and of</i> this also, that is, <i>by</i> whom and how <i>it was done</i>, who ate and who deceived. 139. If he were aware, why <i>had he</i> to make that enquiry of him, 'mayest thou not ever yet <i>have</i> eaten of that tree, <i>of</i> which I commanded that you shall not eat <a name="fr_963"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">1</font></a>?' 140. And at first, when he came forth, he was not exhausted, <i>but</i> afterwards, when he knew that <i>they had</i> eaten, he became exhausted about them and was wrathful.</p>  
 <p>141. His scanty knowledge is also <i>evident</i> from this, when he created the serpent, which <i>was</i> itself his adversary, and put <i>it</i> into the garden with them <a name="fr_964"></a><a href="#fn_956"><font size="1">2</font></a>; (142) or <i>else</i> why <i>was</i> not the garden made so fortified by him, that the serpent, and also other enemies, should thereby not go into it?</p>  
 <p>143. Even his falsity is also evident from this, when he spoke thus: 'When you eat of this tree you die <a name="fr_965"></a><a href="#fn_957"><font size="1">3</font></a>;' and they <i>have</i> eaten and are not dead, but have become really intelligent, (144) and good is well recognised from evil by them.</p>  
 <p>145. <i>I</i> also <i>ask</i> this, that is, how is his knowledge inconsistent <i>and</i> competing with <i>his</i> will and command? 146. For if <i>it were</i> willed by him to eat of that tree, and the command for not eating <i>were</i> given by him, the knowledge about it was that <i>the fruit would be</i> eaten. 147. Now <i>it</i> is evident that the will, knowledge, and command are all three inconsistent, one towards the other.</p>  
 <p>148. This, too, <i>is evident</i>, that, though Adam committed sin, the curse which <i>was</i> inflicted by Him (the Lord) <a name="fr_966"></a><a href="#fn_958"><font size="1">4</font></a> reaches unlawfully over people of every kind</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>at various periods, (149) <i>and</i> I consider <i>it</i>, in every way, a senseless, ignorant, and foolish statement.</p>
