 <p>1. The first subject (2) is about several questions <i>that</i> the ever-successful Mit<i>r</i>ô-aîyyâr <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">1</font></a>, son of Mahmâ<i>d</i>,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a></p>  
 <p>from Spâhân <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">1</font></a>, asked with good intent <i>and</i> not in search of defects, <i>and</i> the answer <i>thereto</i>.</p>  
 <p>3. <i>As to</i> that which is asked thus: 'Why did Aharman hurry on to the light <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and how was it possible to be <i>so</i> when <i>he</i> is not <i>of</i> a like nature with it, though we always see that whatever is not <i>of</i> a like nature abstains from a different nature as much as water <i>does</i> from fire?' 4. The answer is this, that the cause itself of the hurrying on of Aharman, which <i>was</i> to the light, <i>was his</i> different nature. 5. And on account of the desire of a destroyer, which was perpetually in his nature, <i>he</i> is a destroyer of different natures.</p>  
 <p>6. Being injured <i>and</i> injuring, however they occur, do not take place except from difference of nature and those of a different nature. 7. Because <i>in</i> those of a like nature <i>there</i> exist similarity of will and unanimity, one towards the other, not injuring <i>and</i> being injured. 8. And those of a different nature, on account of <i>their</i> opposing nature, are destroyers <i>and</i> injurers, one of the other, however they come together. 9. Those of a like nature, on account of unanimity and similarity of nature, are lively <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">3</font></a>, efficient, and mutually helping, when they come together.</p>  
 <p>10. The disintegration and separation of like natures is the disunion of different natures. 11. Just</p>

 <p>as heat <i>and</i> cold which, on account of <i>their</i> opposing nature, are destroyers and injurers, resisting <i>and</i> disintegrating one another, through <i>their</i> perpetual nature. 12. Because every disintegration is owing to the laws (rastagân) of cold and dryness, heat and moisture, (13) and <i>their</i> destruction, injuring, <i>and</i> opposition of one another. 14. For the disintegration of bodies is owing to the perpetual struggling of heat and cold, dryness and moisture; (15) <i>and</i> owing to their struggling, one with the other, bodies are disintegrated <i>and</i> disabled.</p>  
 <p>16. Of water and fire, through their own nature, no injury whatever is manifest; (17) but the cold of <i>their</i> fraternization <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">1</font></a> is mingled with the moisture of the water, <i>and</i> is an opponent of the heat of the fire; (18) and the dryness of <i>their</i> fraternization is mingled with the heat of the fire, <i>and</i> is counteractingly an injurer of the moisture <i>of</i> the water.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_643"></a><a href="sbe24072.htm#fr_651">122:1</a> This person, who is not mentioned elsewhere, was probably a layman and evidently a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper, although his father's name seems to be Muhammadan, either Mahmûd or Muhammad. The Parsis under a Muhammadan government often adopted Muhammadan names, as they also took Hindu names in India; but, in this case, it is perhaps more probable that the father had become <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a> a convert to Muhammadanism, and changed his name accordingly, after his son had grown up.</p>
