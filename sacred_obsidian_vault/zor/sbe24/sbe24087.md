 <p>1. The division into dars, 'chapters or subjects,' is indicated in the original manuscripts; but for that of the sections the translator is responsible, as the subdivisions of the alternating Persian-Gu<i>g</i>arâti text are often at variance with its meaning.</p>  
 <p>2-6. (The same as on page <a href="sbe24006.htm#page_2">2</a>.)</p>  
 <p>7. All Arabic words are quoted in parentheses on their first occurrence in the text. And the spelling of names approximates more closely to modern Persian than to the older Pahlavi.</p>  
 <p>8. The manuscripts mentioned are:</p>  
 <p>B29 (written A.D. 1679) in a Persian Rivâyat, No. 29 in the University Library at Bombay.</p>  
 <p>J15 (undated) Persian, No. 15 in the library of Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji at Bombay. It has been only occasionally consulted for this translation.</p>  
 <p>La (dated A.D. 1575) Persian, in Avesta writing, alternating with Gu<i>g</i>arâti, No. 3043 of the Persian manuscripts in the India Office Library at London; upon the text of which this translation is based.</p>  
 <p>Lp (undated) Persian, No. 2506 of the Persian manuscripts in the same library.</p>
