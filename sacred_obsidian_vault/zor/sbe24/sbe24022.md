 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Of the food which men eat, and the clothing which men put on, which are the more valuable and good?'</p>  
 <p>3. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of the food which men eat, the milk of goats is produced good. 5. Because, <i>as to</i> men and quadrupeds, who are born from a mother, until the <i>time</i> when food is eaten by them, their growth <i>and</i> nourishment are then from milk, (6) <i>and</i> on milk they can well live. 7. And if men, when they withdraw from the milk of the mother, make thorough experience of the milk of goats, (8) then bread is not necessary for use among them. 9. Since it is declared, (10) that "the food of mankind, who are in Arzah and Savah, Frada<i>d</i>afsh and Vîda<i>d</i>afsh, Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t and Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is the milk of goats and cows; (11) other food they do not eat." 12. <i>And</i> he who is a milk-consuming man is healthier and stronger, and even the procreation of children becomes more harmless.</p>

 <p>13. 'Of grains wheat is called great and good, (14) because it is the chief of grains <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (15) <i>and</i> even by the Avesta its name is then specified in the chieftainship of grains <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>16. 'And of fruit the date <i>and</i> grape are called great and good. 17. When bread has not come, it is necessary to consecrate the sacred cake by means of fruit <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (18) when the fruit to consecrate is the date or grape, it is allowable to eat every fruit; (19) <i>and</i> when those have not come, it is necessary to eat that fruit which is consecrated <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>20. 'Regarding wine <i>it</i> is evident, that it is possible <i>for</i> good <i>and</i> bad temper to come to manifestation through wine <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 21. The goodness of a man is manifested in anger, the wisdom of a man in irregular desire <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 22. For <i>he</i> whom anger hurries on (aû<i>s</i>tâ<i>v</i>ê<i>d</i>)</p>

 <p>is able to recover himself from it <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">1</font></a> through goodness, (23) <i>he</i> whom lust hurries on is able to recover himself from it through wisdom, (24) <i>and he</i> whom wine hurries on is able to recover himself from it through temper.</p>  
 <p>25. 'It is not requisite for investigation, (26) because he who is a good-tempered man, when he drinks wine, is such-like as a gold <i>or</i> silver cup which, however much more they burn <i>it</i>, becomes purer and brighter. 27. It also keeps <i>his</i> thoughts, words, <i>and</i> deeds more virtuous; (28) and he becomes gentler and pleasanter unto wife and child, companions and friends <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (29) and is more diligent in every duty and good work.</p>  
 <p>30. 'And he who is a bad-tempered man, when he drinks wine, thinks <i>and</i> considers himself more than ordinary. 31. He carries on a quarrel with companions, displays insolence, makes ridicule and mockery, (32) <i>and</i> acts arrogantly <i>to</i> a good person. 33. He distresses his own wife and child <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">3</font></a>, slave and servant; (34) and dissipates the joy of the good, (35) carries off peace, <i>and</i> brings in discord.</p>  
 <p>36. 'But every one must be cautious as to <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">4</font></a> the moderate drinking of wine. 17. Because, from the moderate drinking of wine, thus much benefit happens to him: (38) since it digests the food, (39) kindles the <i>vital</i> fire <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">5</font></a>, (40) increases the understanding and intellect, semen and blood, (41) removes vexation, (42) <i>and</i> inflames the complexion.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 43. It causes recollection of things forgotten, (44) <i>and</i> goodness takes a place in the mind. (45) It likewise increases the sight of the eye, the hearing of the ear, and the speaking of the tongue; (46) <i>and</i> work, which it is necessary to do <i>and</i> expedite, becomes more progressive. 47. He <i>also</i> sleeps pleasantly in the sleeping place <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> rises light. 48. And, on account of these contingencies, good repute for the body, righteousness for the soul, and also the approbation of the good <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">2</font></a> come upon him.</p>  
 <p>49. 'And in him who drinks wine more than moderately, thus much defect becomes manifest, (50) since it diminishes his wisdom, understanding and intellect, semen and blood; (51) it injures the liver <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">3</font></a> and accumulates disease, (52) it alters the complexion, (53) and diminishes the strength and vigour. 54. The homage <i>and</i> glorification of the sacred beings become forgotten. 55. The sight of the eye, the hearing of the ear, and the speaking of the tongue become less. 56. He distresses Ho<i>r</i>vada<i>d</i> and Ame<i>r</i>oda<i>d</i> <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">4</font></a> (57) <i>and</i> entertains a desire of lethargy <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 58. That, also, which it is necessary for him to say and do, remains undone; (59) <i>and</i> he sleeps in uneasiness, <i>and</i> rises uncomfortably. 60. <i>And</i>, on account of these contingencies, himself <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">6</font></a>,</p>

 <p>wife, and child, friend <i>and</i> kindred are distressed <i>and</i> unhappy, (61) and the superintendent of troubles <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the enemy are glad. 62. The sacred beings, also, are not pleased with him; (63) and infamy comes to his body, and even wickedness to <i>his</i> soul.</p>  
 <p>64. 'Of the dress which people possess <i>and</i> put on <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">2</font></a>, silk is good for the body, and cotton for the soul. 65. For this reason, because silk arises from a noxious creature <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (66) and the nourishment of cotton is from water, and <i>its</i> growth from earth <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and as a treasure of the soul it is called great and good and more valuable.'</p>

The sacred cake, or drôn, is a small, round, flexible pancake of unleavened wheaten bread, about the size of the palm of the hand, which, after consecration, is tasted by all those present at the ceremony (see Sls. III, 32 n).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="sbe24022.htm#fr_252">46:4</a> Fruit and wine are usually consecrated and eaten, in the Âfrîngân ceremony, after the completion of the Drôn ceremony, but sometimes the Âfrîngân is celebrated alone. Both ceremonies are performed in honour of some angel, or the guardian spirit of some deceased person (see Haug's Essays, pp. 407-409).</p>
