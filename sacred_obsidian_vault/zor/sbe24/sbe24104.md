 <p>1. The sixteenth subject is this, that, when a woman becomes pregnant in a house, it is necessary to make an endeavour so that <i>there may</i> be a continual fire in that house, and to maintain a good watch <i>over it</i>. 2. And, when the child becomes separate from the mother, it is necessary to burn a lamp <i>for</i> three nights <i>and</i> daysif they burn a fire it would be betterso that the demons and fiends <i>may</i> not be able to do any damage and harm; because, when a child is born, it is exceedingly delicate <i>for</i> those three days.</p>  
 <p>3. For it is declared in revelation <a name="fr_1191"></a><a href="#fn_1182"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that, when Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân, became separate from <i>his</i> mother, every night, <i>for</i> three nights, a demon came on, with a hundred and fifty <i>other</i> demons, so that they <i>might</i> effect the slaughter (halâk) of Zaratu<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i>, when they had beheld the light of the fire, they had fled away, and had not been able to do any damage and harm.</p>  
 <p>4. During forty days it is not proper that they <i>should</i> leave the child alone; and it is also not proper that the mother of the infant <i>should</i> put <i>her</i> foot over a threshold in the dwelling, or cast <i>her</i> eyes upon a hill, <i>for</i> it <a name="fr_1192"></a><a href="#fn_1183"><font size="1">2</font></a> is bad <i>for</i> her menstruation.</p>
