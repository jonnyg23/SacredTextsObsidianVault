The ninety-sixth subject is this, when any one departs to that <i>other</i> world it is not proper for others that they <i>should</i> utter an outcry, maintain grief, <i>and</i> make lamentation <i>and</i> weeping. 2.

They shed those tears unlawfully, and they swell to this river. Those who are not able to cross over are those for whom, after their departure, <a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 359</font></a> much lamentation and weeping were made; and those <i>who cross</i> more easily are those for whom less was made' (AV. XVI, 7-10).</p>
