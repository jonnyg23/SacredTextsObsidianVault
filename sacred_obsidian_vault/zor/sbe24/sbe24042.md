 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_374"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_379">71:1</a> See Chap. IV, 4 n.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_375"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_380">71:2</a> If a man has not appointed an adopted son during his lifetime, and leaves property producing an income of eighty-four rûpîs or more, but no privileged wife, or child, or domesticated brother, fit for the duty of guardianship, then an adopted son must be appointed by his nearest relations after his death (see Dd. LVI-LX).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_376"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_381">71:3</a> The sacred fire, named after the angel Varahrâm or Vâhrâm (see Chap. II, 115).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_377"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_382">71:4</a> The baprakŏ-î â<i>v</i>îk is the Av. bawri<i>s</i> upâpô, with whose skins Ardvîsûra, the angel of water, is said to be clothed (Âbân Yt. 129). It is said to have been 'created in opposition to the demon which is it the water' (see Bd. XIX, 29). Whether it is the same as the Av. udra upâpa, 'water-otter,' is not quite certain; but killing the latter was considered (for some reason not clearly ascertained) a very heinous sin, for which the proper atonement is fully detailed in Vend. XIV.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_383">72:1</a> L19 has 'falsehood.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_379"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_384">72:2</a> The term zandîk, according to Masaûdî (chap. xxiv), was first applied to the Manicheans, and afterwards to all others who followed the commentary (zand) in preference to the Avesta; finally, however, the Arabs applied the term to the Persians, probably with its acquired meaning of 'heretic' or 'infidel.' A different explanation of the term is given in Pahl. Yas. LX, 11, where it is stated that 'Zand is the apostle of the wizards, <i>and</i> through Zand it is possible to perform witchcraft.' The Sanskrit version here adds, 'that is, he thinks well of Aharman and the demons;' and in PA10 it continues thus: 'the atheist's religion, the wicked way <i>that</i> there is no creator, there is no heaven, there is no hell, there is no resurrection, <i>and</i> so on; such is the meaning.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_380"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_385">72:3</a> From Av. ashemaogha, 'disturbing righteousness.' Nêr. adds in Sanskrit, 'that is, having thoroughly known the meaning of the Avesta, he becomes deceived.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_381"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_386">72:4</a> As the verb in § 23 can apply, in Pahlavi, to any number of preceding sections, it is omitted by K43 in § 19-22. The verb is also omitted by K43 in § 25 for a similar reason.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_382"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_387">72:5</a> Or 'breach of contract.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_383"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_388">73:1</a> Such appears to be the meaning of zanŏ-î kârân. L19 has zan-î kasân, 'the wives of others.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_384"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_389">73:2</a> Or 'irreverent,' according as we read a<i>r</i>âstô or anâstŏ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_385"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_390">73:3</a> L19 has 'secluded and departed,' similar to Chap. XXXVII, 23.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_386"></a><a href="sbe24042.htm#fr_391">73:4</a> It is doubtful whether sîpan<i>g</i>, 'a halting-place,' or sîpô<i>g</i>, 'setting aside,' should be read; but the meaning is practically the same.</p>
