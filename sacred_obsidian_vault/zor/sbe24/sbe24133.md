 <p>1. The forty-fifth subject is this, that it is continually necessary that <i>people should</i> keep in remembrance the accomplishment of repentance (taûbat). 2. Every time that a sin leaps from control it is necessary to act so that they go before the priests, high-priests, and <i>spiritual</i> chiefs, and accomplish repentance.</p>  
 <p>3. And <a name="fr_1332"></a><a href="#fn_1321"><font size="1">1</font></a> in accordance with the sin <i>should be</i> the good work, just as though the good work <i>were</i> due to that occasion when they accomplish <i>it</i>. 4. While mankind are living, it becomes every year a further benefit. 5. Sin is also, <i>in</i> like manner, going <i>on</i> to a head every year; and when they accomplish repentance, so that it <i>may</i> not increase further, it is just like a tree that becomes withered, and they extirpate its further growth.</p>  
 <p>6. And that repentance is better which they accomplish before high-priests and <i>spiritual</i> chiefs, and when they accomplish the retribution that the high-priest orders every sin that exists departs from them. 7. The repentance <i>that</i> high-priests accomplish they likewise call repentance <a name="fr_1333"></a><a href="#fn_1322"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 8. If <i>there</i> be no high-priest it is necessary to go before some persons who are commissioned <i>by</i> high-priests; and if those, also, do not exist, it is necessary to go to a man <i>who is</i> a friend of the soul, <i>and</i> to accomplish the repentance.</p>

 <p>9. At the time when <i>one</i> shall depart from the world it is incumbent on sons and daughters and relations, that they give repentance into the mouth of the afflicted <i>one, and that</i> they give the Ashem-vohû <a name="fr_1334"></a><a href="#fn_1323"><font size="1">1</font></a> into <i>his</i> mouth. 10. For the high-priests have said that, when they have accomplished repentance because they have committed many sins, they do not arrive in hell, <i>but</i> they administer punishment <i>to them</i> at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, and afterwards conduct <i>them</i> to their own place.</p>  
 <p>11. Repentance is that when they accomplish repentance of the sin which they have committed, and do not commit that sin a second <i>time;</i> if they do commit <i>it</i>, that <i>first sin</i> then comes back <a name="fr_1335"></a><a href="#fn_1324"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>
