 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">1</font></a> [wisdom (2) thus: 'Which protection is the more defensive? 3. Which friend <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">2</font></a> (4) and which supporter of fame are good? 5. Which helper of enjoyment is good? 6. Which wealth is the pleasanter? 7. And which is the supremest pleasure of all pleasures <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">3</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>8. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'The sacred being is the more defensive protection. 10. A virtuous brother is a good friend. 11. A child, who is virtuous and an upholder of religion, is a good supporter of fame. 12. A virtuous wife, who is well-disposed, is a good helper of enjoyment. 13. That wealth is better and pleasanter which is collected by honesty, <i>and one</i> consumes <i>and</i> maintains with duties and good works. 14. <i>And</i> the pleasures which are superior to all pleasures are health of body, freedom from fear, good repute, <i>and</i> righteousness <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="sbe24020.htm#fr_226">41:1</a> From this point to Chap. XXVII, 49 the Pahlavi text of K43 is missing, owing to the loss of nine folios in that MS., but a copy of the missing passage, made by Dastur Hoshangji Jamaspji from TD2, has been consulted for the purpose of controlling the Pâz. version of L19.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe24020.htm#fr_227">41:2</a> L19 inserts 'is good?'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe24020.htm#fr_228">41:3</a> TD2 has 'which is the friend who is the supremest of friends;' but this does not correspond well with the reply in § 14.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe24020.htm#fr_229">41:4</a> TD2 adds '<i>and</i> are good.'</p>
