 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore have the people who <i>were</i> from Gâyômar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> those, too, who <i>were</i> lords and monarchs, from Hôshâng <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>, even unto Vi<i>s</i>tâsp <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the king of kings, been such doers of <i>their own</i> wills? 3. Much benefit <i>was</i> also obtained by them from the sacred beings, (4) <i>and</i> they have been mostly those who <i>were</i> ungrateful unto the sacred beings, (5) and there are <i>some</i> even who have been very ungrateful, promise-breaking, <i>and</i> sinful. 6. For what benefit then have they <i>been</i> severally created, (7) and what result and advantage proceeded from them?'</p>  
 <p>8. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'That which thou askest concerning them, as to benefit, or <i>as to</i> the reverse <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">4</font></a>, thou shouldst become aware of and fully understand. 10. Because the affairs of the world of every kind proceed through destiny and time and the supreme decree of the self-existent eternity (zôrvân), the king and long-continuing lord. 11. Since, at various periods, it happens unto every one, for whom it is allotted, just as that which is necessary to happen. 12. As even from the mutual connection of those ancients, who are passed</p>

 <p>away, it is manifest (13) that, ultimately, that benefit arose which was necessary to come from them to the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>14. 'Because the advantage from Gâyômar<i>d</i> was this, (15) first, the slaying of Ârzûr <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and making delivery of his own body, with great judiciousness, to Aharman <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 16. <i>And</i> the second advantage was this, (17) that mankind and all the guardian spirits of the producers of the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, males <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>and</i> females <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>were</i> produced from his body. 18. <i>And</i>, thirdly, this <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that even the metals <i>were</i> produced <i>and</i> formed <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">6</font></a> from his body <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>19. 'And the advantage from Hôshâng, the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>, was this, (20) that, of three parts, he slew two parts of the demons of Mâzendar <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">8</font></a>, who <i>were</i> destroyers of the world.</p>

 <p>24. 'The advantage from the well-flocked Yimshê<i>d</i> <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a>, son of Vîvangha, was this, (25) that an immortality of six hundred years, six months, and sixteen days <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">3</font></a> is provided by him for the creatures and creation, of every kind, of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; (26) <i>and</i> they are made unsuffering, undecaying, <i>and</i> undisturbed <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">4</font></a>.

Regarding this ridge the following explanation occurs in the Pahlavi Rivâyat which precedes Dd. in many MSS.:'They say that hell is the ridge (pûstŏ) of Arekzûr; and hell is not the ridge of Arekzûr, but that place where the gate of hell <i>exists</i> is a ridge (grîvakŏ) such as the ridge named Arekzûr, and owing to that they assert that <i>it is</i> the ridge (pûstŏ) of Arekzûr.'

Information of this event was conveyed to Yim by the angel Srôsh, who advised him to seek the fiend and propitiate him. Yim, accordingly, went into the wilderness singing, to attract Aharman, and, when the fiend appeared, Yim ingratiated himself into his favour and, taking advantage of an unguarded moment, he dragged Tâkhmorup out of the fiend's entrails, and placed the corpse in a depository for the dead. In consequence of this feat his hand was attacked with leprosy, from which he suffered greatly until it was accidentally washed in bull's urine, which healed it. This legend is related for the purpose of recommending the use of bull's urine for purification of the body.</p>

The name can also be read Gan<i>g</i>akŏ, which might be identified with Canzaca, but this would not correspond so well with the legend, alluded to in the text, which relates how Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, having shut himself up in the impregnable fortress of Âmul in Taparistân, could not be conquered by Frâsîyâk, who was compelled to come to terms, whereby all the country within an arrow-shot east of Mount Dimâvand should remain subject to Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. The arrow was shot and kept on its flight from dawn till noon, when it fell on the bank of the Oxus, which river was thenceforward considered the frontier of the Irânians. This frontier would fully include all the territory between Taparistân and Kâbul mentioned in the text. In Bd. XXXI, 21 the success of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar is attributed to some dispute between Frâsîyâk and his brother, Aghrêra<i>d</i>.</p>

In the Avesta it is called Kãsu, and the future apostles of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping faith are expected to be born on its shores.</p>

Sâma) was the family name of the hero Keresâsp (see Fravar<i>d</i>in Yt. 61, 136), who was a son of Thrita the Sâman (see Yas. IX, 30, 31). For the legends relating to him, see SBE, vol. xviii, pp. 369382. His name is written Sâm in Pâzand.</p>
