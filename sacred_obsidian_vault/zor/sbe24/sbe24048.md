 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How many kinds of man are <i>there?</i>'</p>  
 <p>3. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: '<i>There</i> are three kinds of man, (5) one is man, one is demi-man, and one is demi-demon.</p>  
 <p>6. 'A man is he who is without doubt as to the creativeness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the destructiveness of Aharman, and the existence of the resurrection and future existence; and also <i>as regards</i> every other happiness and misery, in the worldly and spiritual</p>

 <p><i>existences</i>, (7) that <i>its</i> origin is from both of those <i>beings</i>, from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman. 8. And his belief is in this one pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers; (9) and he does not believe in, and does not hearken unto, any heterodoxy.</p>  
 <p>10. 'A demi-man is he who performs the affairs of the worldly, and spiritual <i>existences</i> according to his own opinion, self-conceitedly and obstinately; (11) be they duties and good works by the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, <i>or</i> be they by the will of Aharman, they proceed from him.</p>  
 <p>12. 'A demi-demon is he in whom <i>there</i> is only as <i>it were</i> the name of man <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the human race, <i>but</i> in his doing of every action <i>he</i> is then like unto a two-legged demon. 13. He understands no worldly and no spiritual <i>existence</i>, (14) he understands no good work and no sin, (15) he understands no heaven and no hell, (16) and even the account which is <i>to be rendered</i> by the soul he does not think of.'</p>
