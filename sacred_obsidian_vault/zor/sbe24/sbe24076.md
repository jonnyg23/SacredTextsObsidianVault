 <p>1. <i>As to</i> another delusion <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">3</font></a> of those asserting the non-existence of a sacred being(2) whom they call atheistical (daharî) <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">4</font></a>(3) that they are ordained <i>free</i> from religious trouble (alag) and the toil of practising good works, (4) and the unlimited twaddle (drâyi<i>s</i>n) <a name="fr_737"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">5</font></a> they abundantly chatter, (5) you <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">6</font></a> should observe this:6. That they account this world, with the much change and adjustment of description of its members <i>and</i> appliances, <i>their</i> antagonism to one another, and their confusion with one another, <i>as</i> an original evolution <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">7</font></a> of boundless time. 7. And this, too, that there is no reward of good works, no punishment of sin, no heaven and hell, and no stimulator of good works and crime. 8. Besides</p>

 <p>this, that things are only worldly, and there is no spirit.</p>  
 <p>9. As I <i>have</i> written and shown above <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">1</font></a>(10) that to be made without a maker, and decided without a decider, is as impossible as to prepare <i>what</i> is written without a writer, <i>or</i> a house without a mortar-mixer (râ<i>z</i>) <a name="fr_741"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">2</font></a> and building (dê<i>s</i>âk)(11) things made, of all kinds, cannot arise without making.</p>  
 <p>12. And this worldly <i>existence</i> is owing to the mingling of competing powers. 13. So <i>its</i> numerous possessions are so constructed, selected, <i>and</i> made of diverse races (<i>k</i>îharân), diverse colours, diverse scents, diverse characteristics, <i>and</i> diverse species as I <i>have</i> stated above <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">3</font></a> about the body, (14) that it is constructed <i>and</i> made out of many things, such as bone, fat, sinew, veins, skin, blood, breath, hair <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">4</font></a>, fundament <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">5</font></a>, hand, foot, head, belly, <i>and</i> other members, internal and external, (15) in two series <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">6</font></a> of things of many kinds, of which <i>to be</i> never made by means of the diverse nature of diverse powers, (16) or to arise without a maker, the impossibility is certain.</p>  
 <p>17. And <i>in</i> like manner of the other creatures, plants <i>and</i> trees, water <i>and</i> fire, earth and air, their stimulus, too, which is not themselves, is to their own duty; and they are not stimulators, (18) but there is a stimulator, a building (dê<i>s</i>âk), and a making for</p>

 <p>them. 19. And the usage (vâzâr) which is changing <i>and</i> urging them, from stimulus to stimulus, from statement to statement, <i>and</i> from time to time, is not according to the will and requirement of those made, but according to those that are stimulating and making.</p>  
 <p>20. Even so, indicative of the rotation of the years, months, days, <i>and</i> hours, is the revolution of the <i>celestial</i> sphere and stars which are settled (pasâkhtak), and <i>of</i> the sun and moon which are adjusted (nîvâr<i>d</i>ak), a well-horsed <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">1</font></a> progress <i>and</i> conspicuous revolution. 21. This, too, is an indication that the movements of every appearance (<i>k</i>îharîh) are owing to an exhibitor, by whom the movement of that appearance is exhibited.</p>  
 <p>22. Owing to other differences and different management in the worldly <i>existence</i> (23) it is possible to know, from the worldly <i>existence</i> at various times <i>and</i> various periods, that this worldly <i>existence</i> is not without a manager. 24. Or <i>that</i> its manager is not a sacred being <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who is learned, acting reasonably, of unlimited power, and illumining <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">3</font></a> the sky, is also that which is visible when the development, decay, and death of the world are such, that the nature alike of mankind and animals, and alike of races and trees, is to come from youth to old age, <i>and</i> from old age to death. 25. No one whatever is seen <i>that has</i> come from old age back to youth, <i>or</i> from death back to life, and <i>it</i> is not</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>possible to say <i>so</i>. 26. Nor yet is it proper to think, say, <i>or</i> believe this, (27) that there is no recompense of good works and punishment of crime, (28) nor even an appearance of an attainable creator of all the creatures, and <i>of</i> the daubing of a destroyer.</p>  
 <p>29. Moreover, <i>as to</i> this <i>latter</i>, that is precious to those who are more friends of penury than <i>of</i> the comfort of ill-famed vileness(30) because they produce their happiness thereby <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and are grateful, (31) and when they see distress they become suppliants (32) even from this destiny and dispensation which cannot become spiritual except by the spirits(33) even so, in the appearance of every one <i>of</i> the hungry, (34) <i>and</i> in every one hurrying and straitened <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who is imploring favours, is a manifestation of the maintenance of a hope for a supreme inspection over mankind, <i>and</i>, indeed, over wild animals, birds, <i>and</i> quadrupeds.</p>  
 <p>35. <i>As to</i> this, too, which they call sophistical <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (36) that there is no assurance of even one of <i>these</i> things, (37) because all are jaundiced <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">4</font></a>(38) for whoever says that honey is bitter and honey is sweet, is right <i>in</i> both, (39) since <i>it</i> is bitter to those abounding in bile, <i>and</i> sweet to others; (40) also bread is pleasant and bread is unpleasant are both</p>

 <p>true, (41) since <i>it</i> is pleasant to the hungry, <i>and</i> unpleasant to the surfeited; (42) <i>and</i> many other <i>statements</i> of this description(43) that <i>which</i> should be said in reply to their twaddle is summarily (44) such as the wise <i>have</i> told them (45) thus:'Even this statement of you sophists, about the jaundiced nature of everything, is alike jaundiced, and there is no truth <i>in</i> it.'</p>  
 <p>46. Many other <i>things</i> are said among them; (47) and this that is indicated by us is the predominant information <i>for</i> you victors, (48) so that you <i>may</i> obtain more from revelation.</p>
