 <p>1. The thirty-seventh subject is this, that, when <i>the days of</i> the guardian spirits <a name="fr_1286"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">1</font></a> come on, it is necessary that all persons, among their own food and devotion, <i>should</i> order <i>and</i> provide the sacred cakes and ceremonial, the sacred feast and benedictions (âfrîngân). 2. <i>For</i> these ten days it is incumbent on every one; <i>and</i> those are better which they prepare in their own houses, because the souls <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">2</font></a> go every one to its own house. 3. And they <i>should</i> have an ear for them <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">3</font></a>, so that they <i>may</i> prepare the sacred cakes and feast and benedictions.</p>  
 <p>4. Those ten days any one of all the souls<i>that</i> are in this <i>way</i> <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">4</font></a> in every house where they provide the feast more abundantlyproclaims, as to that master of the house <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that family, and the whole who are in that house, and the year's affairs of every kind, <i>that</i> they are very good, and their entry (da<i>h</i>l) and coming in are very good. 5. And every single</p>

 <p>good work, on account of which we have spoken of the souls of the departed, becomes just like those we have done for our own souls. 6. And, when they pass away from this worldly <i>existence</i>, those souls come again, meeting them, and cause gladness, maintain <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1281"><font size="1">1</font></a> their courage, and also render <i>them</i> honour in the presence of the creator Hôrmazd, and speak <i>thus:</i> '<i>These</i> righteous souls did not put us away from remembrance while they were in the world, <i>and</i> we have been satisfied with them; now we are unanimous that thou <i>shouldest</i> provide them equal shares of those good works of ours, <i>and</i> make their souls attain to the position of the righteous.' 7. They utter these words, and give those souls confidence, while they make out their account. 8. Afterwards, with them, they make the passage of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till they arrive at their own position, <i>and</i> then they return.</p>  
 <p>9. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, so that they <i>may</i> maintain the guardian spirits properly, and the souls of <i>their</i> fathers and mothers and relations <i>may</i> exist with honour from them. 10. For if they retire with dissatisfaction they utter a curse, <i>and</i>, as the soul departs from this world, they administer reproaches to it, and speak <i>thus:</i> 'Thou thinkest that they wish continually to make a way <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1282"><font size="1">2</font></a> for thee <i>to</i> that place, <i>but</i> it is not necessary for thee to come into this world <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1283"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 11. Now, hadst thou performed duty <i>and</i> good works on our behalf, and hadst thou recollected us, we would also have come to thy assistance, and would have released thee from</p>

 <p>this fearful position.' 12. And that <i>soul</i> experiences much repentance, and has no advantage whatever <i>from it</i>.</p>
