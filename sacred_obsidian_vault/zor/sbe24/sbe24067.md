 <p><a name="fn_580"></a><a href="sbe24067.htm#fr_588">108:4</a> A name of the Kar<i>s</i>ipt, who is said to be the chief of birds in this world (Pahl. Visp. I, 1, Bd. XXIV, 11), the Vi<i>s</i> Kar<i>s</i>ipta who brought the religion to the enclosure formed by Yim (see Vend. II, 138, 139), and which is said, in the Pahlavi version, to be 'a <i>K</i>ahârvâk (or <i>K</i>ahârnâk) who goes back into the existence of the spirits.' To determine the meaning of this name (which Nêr. translates by Sans: <i>k</i>akravâka, 'Brahmany duck') we have to consider not only the two forms <i>k</i>îharâ<i>v</i> and <i>k</i>ahârvâk, but also the term <i>k</i>ark, 'falcon,' used in Bd. XXIV, 11. The <i>k</i>âmrô<i>s</i> of Bd. XIX, 15, XXIV, 29 (the <i>k</i>înâmrô<i>s</i> of Chap. LXII, 40) is also said to be the chief of birds, but probably mythic birds are meant.</p>
