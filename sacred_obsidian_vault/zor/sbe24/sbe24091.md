For it is declared in revelation, that every one who hereafter becomes employed <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>on</i> his own work, if in the midst of that work any trouble and discomfort happen to him, obtains in that <i>other</i> world twelve recompenses <a name="fr_1095"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">3</font></a> for every single <i>instance</i>. 3. If he becomes employed <i>on</i> iniquity (fasâd), and in the midst of that work any trouble and harm happen to him, he so <a name="fr_1096"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">4</font></a> obtains in that <i>other</i> world only torment (huqûbat) and punishment.</p>

If he be slain he becomes righteous, any sin that he has committed goes clean <i>away</i> from him, <i>and</i> they convey him to heaven. 6. But (ammâ) if he becomes faulty (bâ<i>t</i>il) in any duty, and a robber falls upon him on the road <a name="fr_1099"></a><a href="#fn_1091"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and carries off his wealth (mâl), or he be slain, when he descends to that <i>other</i> world <a name="fr_1100"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">4</font></a> all the property that <i>other</i> carried off from him becomes just as <i>though it were</i> his who has carried it off from that person <a name="fr_1101"></a><a href="#fn_1093"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and, besides, <i>there</i> occur, as a substitute (hivaʓ̣) <i>for</i> that property, the punishment and torment they give him. 7. <i>And</i> if he be slain it is just as <i>though</i> he who has carried it off from that person <i>were one</i> who had innocently slain that person who arrives in hell as retribution (mukâfât) for sin.</p>
