 <p>1. The twenty-fifth subject is this, that any agreement and promise (qaûl) they make with any one it is necessary so far to perform and bring to pass. 2. Although many things <i>may</i> go <a name="fr_1238"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">6</font></a> to harm by means (sabab) of it, it is not desirable to perform that agreement with duplicity.</p>  
 <p>3. Because, in our religion, they call this a Mihir-dru<i>g</i> ('breach of promise'), <i>and</i> in revelation it decrees, <i>as to</i> any one <i>who</i> commits a Mihir-dru<i>g</i>, that the way <i>to</i> heaven becomes closed for him, and that person himself goes discomforted out of this world, so that a warning (halâmat) becomes quite manifest unto him.</p>  
 <p>4. And a Mihir-dru<i>g</i> is attached <a name="fr_1239"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">7</font></a> <i>in</i> such a manner that, <i>if</i> fortune (<i>t</i>âlih) may have befallen any one <a name="fr_1240"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>happily, or an insufficient quantity of his life (humr) may have remained, the Mihir-dru<i>g</i> extends to his children without opposition (<i>h</i>ilâf). 5. And every household that becomes extinct, or race whose issue fails, or <i>any of</i> the great misfortunes that happen to mankindfrom which misfortune <i>one</i> obtains release with difficultymay all be owing to the <i>fact</i> that they have committed a Mihir-dru<i>g</i>.</p>  
 <p>6. If <i>committed by</i> oneself, it is declared, <i>in</i> one place in revelation, that the glorified Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân, enquired of Hôrmazd, the good <i>and</i> propitious, thus: 'Of any of the sins that mankind commit which is the worst?' 7. Hôrmazd, the good <i>and</i> propitious, decreed thus: 'No sin whatever is worse than this, that two persons make a covenant with one another <i>in</i> such a manner that no one whatever is between them, except me who am Hôrmazd; <i>and</i>, afterwards one of those two persons deviates <i>from it</i>, and says, "I have no knowledge (<i>h</i>abar) <i>of it</i>," and no one whatever is a witness, for that <i>other</i> person, except me.' 8. No sin whatever is worse than that, and that person himself <i>will</i> not go out of this world until retribution overtakes him, and in that <i>other</i> world his punishment is more severe than all; <i>so</i> that person becomes unfortunate <i>in</i> both worlds. 9. And it is the same <i>if</i> this covenant <i>be</i> with a righteous <i>person or</i> a wicked <i>one</i>.</p>
