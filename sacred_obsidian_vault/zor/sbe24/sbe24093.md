 <p>1. The fifth subject is this, that it is necessary for all those of the good religion that they make a thorough effort, so that they celebrate the ritual and become Navazû<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1109"></a><a href="#fn_1101"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. For in our religion there is no good work more ample than this. 3. And it is declared in revelation, that, although much duty and good work be performed, it s not possible to attain to the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân) <a name="fr_1110"></a><a href="#fn_1102"><font size="1">2</font></a>, except <i>on</i> that one occasion when the Navazû<i>d</i> <i>ceremony</i> is performed, or they have celebrated a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1111"></a><a href="#fn_1103"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 4. And <i>on</i> any occasion (hâl), if they are not able to perform <i>it</i> with their own hands, it is requisite to order <i>it; and</i> then it is inevitably necessary that the celebration of <a name="fr_1112"></a><a href="#fn_1104"><font size="1">4</font></a> the Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> should be <i>in</i> the same manner as they <i>would</i> have performed <i>it</i> with their own hands.</p>

 <p>5. Man and woman are both <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1105"><font size="1">1</font></a> equal in this good work; therefore <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1106"><font size="1">2</font></a>, it is not proper to neglect this duty, for it is the chief of all the good works of the religion. 6. Because it is declared in revelation, that on the day that they are performing the Navazû<i>d</i> <i>ceremony</i>, or are celebrating a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> on his account, three times the soul of that person arrives at heaven, and they show it a place therein, and offer it a profuse greeting (niTHâr) <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1107"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. The explanation (tafsîr) of the Gâhs <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">4</font></a> is this, that a Gâhthat is, that his own placebecomes visible to him <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1109"><font size="1">5</font></a> in heaven that day.</p>  
 <p>8. And if <i>one</i> does not perform a Navazû<i>d</i> <i>ceremony</i>, or does not order the celebration of a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i>, it is the same as when a poor (<i>gh</i>arîb) man makes <i>for</i> <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1110"><font size="1">6</font></a> a town, and does not obtain a spot where he <i>may</i> alight <i>in</i> that place. 9. Although it is his own town he is in this trouble. 10. Therefore, it is not possible to bring to hand a place in heaven through any good work, except by the performance of the Navazû<i>d</i> ceremony, or <i>by</i> ordering the celebration of a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>11. And a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> is this, that heaven is purchased in the world, and one's own place brought to hand in heaven.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1101"></a><a href="sbe24093.htm#fr_1109">262:1</a> Apparently 'newly born' (see Sls. XIII, 2 n), a term applied to one who has been duly initiated. After preparatory performances of the Bareshnûm purification and the ordinary ceremonial, the ceremonies are carried on four days longer by two priests. The first day's ceremony is that of the Nônâbar, the second is the Srôsh ya<i>s</i>t, the third is the Sîrôzah, and the fourth is the Vispara<i>d</i> (see Vi<i>g</i>irkar<i>d</i> î Dînik, ed. Peshotan, p. 147).</p>
