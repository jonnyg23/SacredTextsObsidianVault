 <p>1. The twentieth subject is this, that it is incumbent on those of the good religion that they continually give something to the worthy to eat, on account (<i>g</i>ihat) of that which it says in revelation <a name="fr_1212"></a><a href="#fn_1203"><font size="1">3</font></a> thus: 'When thou givest things to some one that he <i>may</i> eat, every duty and good work that he performs in that <i>state of</i> repletion become <i>those</i> of that person, who has given that bread or food to him, just like those which he has performed with his own hand.' 2. And if he commits a sin, he who may have given food to him is innocent. 3. But it is necessary that he be of the good religion and worthy; they <i>should</i> give something to <i>one of</i> a different religion only in case of extreme necessity (ʓ̣arûrat), lest it become as a sin.</p>
