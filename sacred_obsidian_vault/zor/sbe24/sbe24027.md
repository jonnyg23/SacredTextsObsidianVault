 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the end of the world-arranging <i>and</i> spirit-destroying man? 3. What is the end of him who is a scoffing man? 4-6. What is the end of the idle, the malicious, and the lazy man? 7. What is the end of a false-hearted <i>one</i>, (8) and the end of an arrogant <i>one</i> <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>9. The spirit of wisdom answered (10) thus: 'He who is a world-arranging <i>and</i> spirit-destroying man is as injured, in the punishment of the three <i>nights</i> <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as a raging fire when water comes upon it.</p>  
 <p>11 <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 'Of him who is a scoffing man <i>there</i> is no glory in body and soul; (12) <i>and</i> every time when he opens <i>his</i> mouth his wickedness then increases. 13. All the fiends, too, become so lodged in his body, that they leave no goodness whatever for his body; (14) and he makes mockery of the good, and glorification of the vile. 15. Also in the worldly <i>existence</i> his body is infamous, and <i>in</i> the spiritual <i>existence his</i> soul is wicked. 16. And, for effecting <i>his</i> punishment in hell, they deliver him over to</p>

 <p>the scoffing fiend; (17) <i>and</i> that fiend inflicts a ridicule and a mockery upon him with every single punishment.</p>  
 <p>18. '<i>As to</i> him who is an idle man, yet devoid of wickedness, mostly when <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">1</font></a> death comes on in the worldly <i>existence</i>, he thereupon (a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>) begets pleasantly for the sake of another.</p>  
 <p>19. 'The bridge <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">2</font></a> which is for the soul of him who is a malicious man is more difficult than <i>for</i> the other wicked who are in hell. 20. For this reason, because malice proceeds by lineage; (21) <i>and</i> it is possible to manage every sin better than malice, (22) because malice will abide in a lineage. 23. There are <i>instances</i> when it adheres <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">3</font></a> until the renovation <i>of the universe;</i> (24) for <i>it</i> is clearly declared by the pure revelation, (25) that the origin of the estrangement (anîrânîh) of the Arûmans, <i>and</i> even the Tûrânians, <i>from</i> the Irânians, was owing to that malice which <i>was</i> generated by them through the slaughter of Aîrî<i>k</i> <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">4</font></a>; (26) <i>and it</i> always adheres until the renovation.</p>

 <p>27. 'He who is a lazy man is said <i>to be</i> the most unworthy of men. 28. Because <i>it</i> is declared by revelation, (29) that the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced no corn for him who is a lazy man; (30) for him who is a lazy man <i>there</i> is then no giving of anything in gifts and charity <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">1</font></a>; (31) and lodging and entertainment are not to be provided for him. 32. For this reason, because that food which a lazy man eats, he cats through impropriety and injustice; (33) and, on account of his laziness and unjust eating, his body then becomes infamous and the soul wicked.</p>  
 <p>34. 'He who is a false-hearted man is as dubious in good <i>things</i> as in bad; (35) <i>he</i> is dubious as to the treasure of the spiritual and worldly <i>existences</i>, and also as to the ceremonial, invocation, <i>and</i> service of the sacred beings. 36. And, on account of these circumstances, the angels <i>and</i> archangels shall accept little of the ceremonial <i>and</i> invocations which he performs, (37) and give unto him little of the gain, too, which he seeks. 38. And in the mouth of the good <i>man he</i> is always infamous, (39) and his soul becomes wicked.</p>  
 <p>40. 'The friends of him who is an arrogant man are few, and his enemies many. 41. And even of the gifts which he gives to any one, <i>and</i> the ceremonial, too, which he performs for the sacred beings, they shall accept little, on account of <i>his</i> arrogance, (42) and give little of the gain, too, which he seeks. 43. And in hell they deliver him to the fiend of arrogance, in order to inflict punishment upon <i>his</i> soul; (44) and the fiend of arrogance inflicts punishment of various kinds upon it, <i>and</i> is not pacified.'</p>
