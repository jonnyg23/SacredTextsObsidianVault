 <p>1. The thirty-ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to properly maintain the sacred fire <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">1</font></a> which they have established in a town or village. 2. And <i>at</i> night it is necessary to make <i>it</i> blaze up once, and by day twice.</p>  
 <p>3. For it is declared in revelation, that, if <i>there</i> had been no sacred fire, no one would have been able to go from town to town; because it is <i>owing to</i> the glory of the sacred fire that no one on the roads is able to commit an excess upon any one <i>else</i>.</p>  
 <p>4. It is necessary that they <i>should</i> present the whole of the firewood; and, <i>as to</i> the person who makes <i>it</i> blaze, they <i>should</i> give him bread and a salary (nafaqah). 5. For, every time that that fire is satisfied, and they maintain <i>it</i> properly, every fire that may exist in the earth of seven regions becomes satisfied with that person.</p>
