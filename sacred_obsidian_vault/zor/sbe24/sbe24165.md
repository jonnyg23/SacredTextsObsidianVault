 <p>1. The seventy-seventh subject is this, that, when a woman's infant is still-born, it is necessary to give <i>her</i> first something washed with ceremony <i>and</i> brought <i>with</i> fire-ashes <a name="fr_1489"></a><a href="#fn_1478"><font size="1">3</font></a>, so that it <i>may</i> make the heart within her pure. 2. After that, <i>for</i> three days, it is altogether improper to give <i>her</i> water, <i>or</i> anything in which <i>there</i> is water or salt. 3. And these three days are from period to period <a name="fr_1490"></a><a href="#fn_1479"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>in</i> such a</p>

 <p>manner that, if the duty of mid-day <a name="fr_1491"></a><a href="#fn_1480"><font size="1">1</font></a> prayer has occurred, they extend till the mid-day prayer itself, <i>and she is</i> to pass over one other hour <i>and</i> it is <i>then</i> proper to swallow water. 4. After that, till the lapse of forty days, <i>she is</i> to sit apart again, and, afterwards, to undergo the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> <a name="fr_1492"></a><a href="#fn_1481"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>On</i> the infant's becoming a four-months <i>child</i>, whenever it is <i>still-</i>born it is a dead <i>body</i> <a name="fr_1493"></a><a href="#fn_1482"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the reason that so long as it does not reach the fourth month life does not come to it. 6. And if after three months this affair occurs, <i>one is</i> to exercise great caution (ihtiyâ<i>t</i>) and to insist strictly on this matter.</p>  
 <p>7. For our religion has reiterated on this matter that, if <i>one</i> be polluted and do not keep himself pure, so long as he is living he never becomes clean from that pollution. 8. That, if he wash <i>his</i> head ten thousand times in <i>ceremonial</i> ablution, he certainly does not any <i>way</i> become pure from it <a name="fr_1494"></a><a href="#fn_1483"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 9. Because this pollution is not from without; it is from within every bone and vein and tendon; <i>and</i> water makes clean <i>only</i> anything that is on the skin. 10. Impurity which is <i>in</i> the bones, except <i>through the liquid consecrated by</i> the religious formula <a name="fr_1495"></a><a href="#fn_1484"><font size="1">5</font></a>, does not otherwise become clean.</p>

Whether the three days are to be inclusive, or exclusive, of the day when the term begins, that is, whether the term is to be nearly 48 or 72 hours, is not very clear.</p>
