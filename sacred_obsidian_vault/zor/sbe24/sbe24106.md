 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Pahlavi Texts, Part III (SBE24)</i>, E.W. West, tr. [1885], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>  
 <p>1. The eighteenth subject is this, that it is necessary for mankind to make an endeavour, so that they <i>may</i> espouse a wife in <i>their</i> youth and beget a child. 2. And for women, in like manner, it is necessary that <i>there</i> should be a longing (ra<i>gh</i>bat) for espousing a husband.</p>  
 <p>3. Because it is declared in revelation <a name="fr_1194"></a><a href="#fn_1185"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>that</i> every duty and good work a child performs becomes the father's and mother's, just like those which they have performed with their own hands. 4. The meaning (mahnî) of pûr ('a son') is that which signifies pûl ('a bridge') <a name="fr_1195"></a><a href="#fn_1186"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for by this bridge they arrive at that <i>other</i> world. 5. If <i>there</i> be no child for any one they call <i>him one with</i> a severed bridge, that is, the</p>  
 <p>

 <p>way for him <i>to</i> that <i>other</i> world is severed, and he is not able to attain to that world. 6. At the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge he shall remain; although he has performed much duty and good works he is not able to make a passage over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, and they do not make up his account and reckoning. 7. And every archangel that comes forward <i>to</i> that place first asks these words, that is, 'Hast thou brought thy own substitute visibly into the world, or not?' 8. When he has not brought <i>it</i>, they will pass over him, and his soul will remain, <i>in</i> that place <a name="fr_1196"></a><a href="#fn_1187"><font size="1">1</font></a>, full of anguish and grief (<i>gh</i>am).</p>  
 <p>9. A similitude (miTHâl) of it is like that which <i>happens when</i> any one may be in a wilderness, and <i>there</i> may be fear of wild animals and creatures, and near to him may be his own town, <i>but</i> a river of water is in front <a name="fr_1197"></a><a href="#fn_1188"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and it is not possible to make a passage over that river, <i>as</i> a bridge is fallen in, and he is not able to arrive at that town, <i>but</i> he is always upon the bank (sar<i>t</i>) <i>speaking</i> thus <a name="fr_1198"></a><a href="#fn_1189"><font size="1">3</font></a>: 'Would that the bridge would become perfect!'</p>  
 <p>10. The duty as to children <a name="fr_1199"></a><a href="#fn_1190"><font size="1">4</font></a> is in this aggregate <a name="fr_1200"></a><a href="#fn_1191"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 11. Therefore, the creator Hôrmazd <i>has</i> granted unto men that, if <i>there</i> be any one to whom sickness from heaven may occur, and <i>there</i> be no provision of a child for him, he <i>has</i> commanded him that he <i>should</i> make some one a son of his own, as <a name="fr_1201"></a><a href="#fn_1192"><font size="1">6</font></a> a friend of <i>his</i> soul, and <i>should</i> receive a child, because every duty <i>can be</i> delegated. 12. That person is in place of a</p>

 <p>child, and every duty and good work that he performs shall be just like that <i>which</i> is performed by one's own hand.</p>  
 <p>13. And, finally, if any one departs from the world (dunyâ) <a name="fr_1202"></a><a href="#fn_1193"><font size="1">1</font></a> and possesses no adopted child, it is incumbent on the priests and high-priests and his relations to appoint his adopted son, and it is necessary to bring some one in sight on that account, so that his soul <i>may</i> spring away from the torment of hell. 14. Because, every time that his relations do not pay attention <i>to this</i>, when they proceed to that <i>other</i> world, the soul of that person hangs about them and speaks thus: 'I left with you something that I had collected and borne trouble for in many years, and you seized upon <i>it</i>, and put <i>it</i> into your own expenditure (<i>h</i>arg), and did not seek for <a name="fr_1203"></a><a href="#fn_1194"><font size="1">2</font></a> mercy (<i>s</i>afqat) on my soul. 15. <i>In</i> the same manner as I have remained, delayed (maûqûf) <i>in</i> this place, I <i>will</i> not let you pass; so that you <i>will</i> make no passage over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge till the sacred being takes my rights away from you.' 16. Then the angel Rashn and the angel Mihir <a name="fr_1204"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">3</font></a> make up their reckoning, <i>and, as to</i> whatever those persons have seized upon from the <i>other's</i> property <a name="fr_1205"></a><a href="#fn_1196"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for every single dînâr the account makes four, and they take away the equivalent. 17. And, <i>as</i> in that world <i>there</i> are no gold and silver, they take away from their souls the good works that they have done, and they give <i>them</i> to the soul of this <i>other</i>. 18. Still, while <i>others</i> do not appoint the adopted son, they are not able to pass over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, nor to arrive at their own station.</p>

 <p>19. There is no duty whatever more incumbent on relations than this duty, and every time that they appoint an adopted son <i>for</i> any one it is just as though they have made the deceased alive; and there are no limit (hadd) and end (nihâyat) of their good works.</p>
