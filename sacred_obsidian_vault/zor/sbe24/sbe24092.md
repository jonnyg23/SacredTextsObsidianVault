 <p>1. The fourth subject is this, that it is not desirable for any one that he <i>should</i> become hopeless of the pity (rahmat) and forgiveness of Hôrmazd, and fix <i>his</i> heart outwardly <a name="fr_1102"></a><a href="#fn_1094"><font size="1">6</font></a> on this, that our sin is excessive <i>and it is</i> not possible to arrive in heaven. 2. Because it happens that a small quantity of duty <i>and</i> good work is performed, <i>and</i> it may be that for that</p>  
 <p>

 <p>quantity Hôrmazd, the good <i>and</i> propitious, <i>may</i> have pity on him <i>and may</i> make <i>him</i> arrive in heaven.</p>  
 <p>3. For it is declared in revelation <a name="fr_1103"></a><a href="#fn_1095"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that one time when Zaratu<i>s</i>t was in conversation <i>with</i> the sacred being, the most high, he saw a man whose whole <a name="fr_1104"></a><a href="#fn_1096"><font size="1">2</font></a> body was in hell, and one footthe right <i>one</i> <a name="fr_1105"></a><a href="#fn_1097"><font size="1">3</font></a>was outside of hell. 4. Zaratu<i>s</i>t enquired of the sacred being, the most high <a name="fr_1106"></a><a href="#fn_1098"><font size="1">4</font></a>, thus: 'What person has this man been?' 5. Hôrmazd, the good <i>and</i> propitious, gave a reply (<i>g</i>avâb) thus: 'He has been a king, and possessed the sovereignty of thirty-three towns, and was conducting that sovereignty many years. 6. And he never did any virtuous action, but was committing much oppression, lawlessness, and violence (<i>th</i>ulṁ) . 7. By chance (qaʓ̣ârâ) he was one day going on the chase, <i>and</i> arrived out at a place (maûʓ̣ah) <i>and</i> saw a goat <i>that</i> was tied. 8. A morsel of hay <i>was</i> placed very far <i>off</i>, and that goat was hungry. 9. Owing to this the goat was trying to eat the hay, but did not reach the hay. 10. This the king saw, <i>and</i> kicked <i>his</i> foot at that hay <i>and</i> cast <i>it</i> in front of the goat. 11. Now, in recompense for that, that one foot of his is outside of hell, and the remaining (bâqî) limbs <a name="fr_1107"></a><a href="#fn_1099"><font size="1">5</font></a> are in hell.'</p>  
 <p>12. Therefore, although a sin has happened to any one, it is not necessary <i>for him</i> <a name="fr_1108"></a><a href="#fn_1100"><font size="1">6</font></a> to become hopeless. 13. And whoever has the power (<i>t</i>âqat)</p>

 <p>is to endeavour to perform good works, so that <i>there</i> may be an atonement for the sin thereby; because the sacred being, the good <i>and</i> propitious, is kind to every one.</p>
