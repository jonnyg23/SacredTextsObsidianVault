 <p>1. The eighty-first subject is this, that every duty and good work, which it is requisite to perform, they <i>should</i> accomplish while within that day, and not postpone for the morrow.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. For it is declared in revelation, that the creator Hôrmazd spoke to Zaratu<i>s</i>t thus: 'O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! I have created no one better than thee in the world, and after thee I <i>shall</i> likewise not create <i>one;</i> thou <i>art</i> my chosen one, and I have made this world apparent on account of thee. 3. And all <a name="fr_1514"></a><a href="#fn_1503"><font size="1">1</font></a> these people (<i>h</i>alâîq) whom I have created, and the whole of these monarchs who have existed and do exist, have always maintained the hope that I <i>should</i> create thee in their days, so that they <i>should</i> accept (qabûl kunand) the religion, and their souls <i>should</i> attain to the supreme heaven.</p>  
 <p>4. 'Nevertheless I have created <i>thee</i> at the present time, in the middle period; for it is three thousand years from the days of Gayômard till now, and from now till the resurrection are the three thousand years that remain: therefore, I have created thee in the middle. 5. For whatever is in the middle is more precious and better and more valuable, <i>in</i> the same manner as the heart is in the middle of the whole body <i>and</i> is unquestionably (lâ-<i>g</i>arm) very precious <a name="fr_1515"></a><a href="#fn_1504"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>in</i> the same manner as the land of <i>E</i>rân <a name="fr_1516"></a><a href="#fn_1505"><font size="1">3</font></a> is more valuable than other lands, for the reason that it is in the middle. 6. And the country of <i>E</i>rân, which is <i>in</i> the fourth climate (iqlîm) <a name="fr_1517"></a><a href="#fn_1506"><font size="1">4</font></a>, is better than other places, for the reason that it is in the middle. 7. Therefore, I have created thee in the middle, in the manner of <i>what is</i> precious, and I have given thee the apostleship, and have sent <i>thee</i> to a monarch, a friend of knowledge and a friend of religion.</p>  
 <p>8. 'Afterwards, I have sent thee, with thus much</p>

 <p>preciousness, to the people; and the knowledge of the good works that mankind perform <a name="fr_1518"></a><a href="#fn_1507"><font size="1">1</font></a> in life, and have not been able to bring to hand without trouble (mihnat), I have made clear <i>and</i> plain unto thee; and I have made thee aware of the whole of knowledge. 9. I have taught <i>it</i> <a name="fr_1519"></a><a href="#fn_1508"><font size="1">2</font></a> to thee in the Avesta, in a language that no one in the world considers plain <i>and</i> easy; and I have told thee its interpretation (zand) in a language that is more current among mankind, and thou likewise hast more eloquence (faʓh) therein.</p>  
 <p>10. 'While <i>thou hast</i> all this greatness that I have given to thee, O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! I enact a precept for thee, that "every good work which thou art able to do to-day do not postpone for to-morrow, and accomplish with thine own hand the counsel of thine own soul." 11. Do not be proud (<i>gh</i>arrah) on the <i>score</i> that it is still <i>the time of</i> youth, <i>and</i> it is quite possible to do <i>it hereafter</i>, while thou thinkest thus: "I will do <i>it</i> after this." 12. For <i>there</i> have been many people whose <i>remaining</i> life was one day, and they have been taken <i>away</i> in the presence of fifty years work <a name="fr_1520"></a><a href="#fn_1509"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>13. Therefore, make an effort, so that thou <i>mayest</i> not postpone to-day's duty for to-morrow. 14. Because Aharman, the evil wicked <i>one</i>, has intrusted two fiends with this matter, the name of one is Tardy (dêr) and the name of the other is Afterwards (pas). 15. Both these fiends are united, <i>and</i> they</p>

 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a></p>  
 <p>make an effort and exertion <a name="fr_1521"></a><a href="#fn_1510"><font size="1">1</font></a> with man, so that his duty falls back behindhand <a name="fr_1522"></a><a href="#fn_1511"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 16. For, <i>as to</i> every duty and good work which comes forward, that fiend whose name is Tardy speaks thus: 'Thou wilt live long, and it is possible to perform this duty <i>at</i> all times;' and that fiend whose name is Afterwards says: 'Pass on now; it is possible to perform <i>it</i> afterwards.' 17. And these two fiends united keep the soul away from its own duty, till the end arrives; all duties have fallen back behindhand, and <i>it has</i> to experience regret (hasarat) and penitence. 18. It has no benefit through duty <i>and</i> good works, <i>and</i> departs from this world.</p>
