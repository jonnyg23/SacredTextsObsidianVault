 <p>1. And <i>as to</i> that which is asked (2) thus: 'Why does not the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> keep Aharman back from evil doing and evil seeking, when he is the mighty maker? 3. As I assert that no mighty maker is afterwards imperfect <i>nor</i> yet unresisting.'</p>  
 <p>4. The answer is this, (5) that the evil deeds of Aharman are owing to the evil nature and evil will which are always his, as a fiend. 6. The omnipotence of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is that which is over all <i>that</i> is possible to be, and is limited <i>thereby</i>.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 125</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. That which is not possible to be is not stirred up <i>by</i> a capable <i>or</i> an incapable being. 8. Whoever says <i>it is so</i> is not within the limits of understanding the words. 9. Because, though he said that it is not possible to be, he says again that the sacred being is capable of it, <i>and</i> that <i>has</i> brought it out of the limits of <i>what</i> is not possible to be. 10. For then <i>it</i> is not the not-possible, but the possible to be.</p>  
 <p>11. As his capability is limited, so also is <i>his</i> will, thereby. 12. For <i>he</i> is sagacious, (13) and the will of a sagacious <i>being</i> is all for that which is possible to be, (14) and his will does not pass on to that which is not possible <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (15) because he wills all that which is possible <i>and</i> fit to be.</p>  
 <p>16. If I say that the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is able to keep Aharman back from the evil which is his perpetual nature, (17) it is possible to change that nature which is demoniacal into a divine <i>one</i>, and that which is divine into a demoniacal <i>one</i>; (18) and it is possible to make the dark light, and the light dark.</p>  
 <p>19. <i>Of</i> the changing of a nature by its own self those not understanding nature speak, (20) who are uninformed of the nature of the result <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">2</font></a> in actions <i>and</i> propensities <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (21) and they account the wolf <i>and</i> noxious creatures as a benefit.</p>

 <p>22. Since the harm and evil which <i>arise</i> from mankind and cattle are not naturally their own, but are owing to the havoc, deceit, solicitation, <i>and</i> deluding <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the fiend, (23) <i>they</i> are from the like vileness of other fiends who are such as the malice, wrath, and lust <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">2</font></a> which are mingled with mankind. 24. Just as the swallowing of bitter medicine, which is mingled with poison, is not the accomplishment of happiness, but for the removal of the pain and sickness which are owing to an extraneous nature (ba<i>r</i>â gôhar). 25. As of a statement which is true <i>or</i> false(26) though it <i>may</i> be that, connected with a false statement, a righteous man is preserved from much harm, and is ruined by that which is true(27) mostly that benefit is not from the false statement, but from the removal of the destruction and evil which are mingled with the vile, (28) and that harm is not from the true statement, but from the evil which is mingled with the vile.</p>  
 <p>29. Also, as regards that which <i>happens</i> when opponents have appeared <i>in order</i> to remove each one its own competitor, (30) every one is unrestricted <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>in</i> keeping away that which is its own opponent, (31) such as light <i>and</i> darkness, perfume <i>and</i> stench, good works <i>and</i> crime, erudition <i>and</i> ignorance. 32. That <i>which</i> is not unrestricted is the</p>

 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p>  
 <p>light to keep away stench, nor the perfume darkness; (33) but they have each separately appeared <i>in order</i> to keep away their own opponent.</p>  
 <p>34. <i>As to</i> that, too, which they say <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that in the dark night a righteous man is preserved from the lion, wolves, dogs, and robbers, (35) <i>while</i> in the light day he becomes a captive <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">2</font></a> in their hands, (36) it is not proper to consider that as a benefit owing to darkness, nor yet as an evil owing to light. 37. Because light is created for the removal of darkness, not for the keeping away of the lion, wolf, and noxious creatures. <i>And there are</i> many other <i>things</i> which are of this nature. 38. On account of tediousness <i>this</i> is collected <i>merely</i> as a summary; the virtue <i>and</i> understanding of you triumphant <i>ones</i> (39) are so much, that you <i>may</i> obtain more from revelation.</p>
