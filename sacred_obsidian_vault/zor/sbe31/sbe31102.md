 <p><a name="fn_1522"></a><a href="sbe31102.htm#fr_1548">372:4</a> Recited during the days called after the Gâthas, the last five of the year. A long period of time must have elapsed since the Gâthas were composed, as they probably were not originally 'five,' and yet seem to have been only remembered as such.</p>
