 <p>1. We worship the (sacrificial) words correctly uttered, and Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and the good Ashi, (the blest order of our rites), and Nairya-sangha. And we worship the victorious Peace as the unprostrated and unmoved. And we sacrifice to the Fravashis of the saints, and to the <i>K</i>inva<i>t</i> Bridge, and to the Garô Nmâna of Ahura, even Heaven, the best world of the saints, the shining and all glorious!</p>  
 <p>2. And we sacrifice to that better path <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1427"><font size="1">3</font></a> that leads to that Best World (as well).

And we worship Pare<i>n</i>di the wealthy, wealthy with a wealth of thoughts, with a throng of words, and with a breadth of actions, [for she makes our persons agile (for good thoughts and words and actions)]. 3. And we worship that virile defensive <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1428"><font size="1">1</font></a> Heroism which possesses men who think beforehand, and heroic men, which is fleeter <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1429"><font size="1">2</font></a> than the fleet, stronger than the strong, which comes to him who is endowed by God, which, when especially made theirs by men, produces one who is a freer of the body. And we worship Sleep <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1430"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the Mazda-made, the gladdener of the herd and men. 4. And we worship those things in the creation of the holy which are the ancient institutions, those formed before the sky, the water, the land, the plants, and the Kine of blessed gift. And we worship the sea Vouru-kasha, and the stormy wind which is made by Mazda, and the shining heaven, of old created, the first-made earthly object of (all) the earthly world.</p>  
 <p>5. And we worship thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! the holy lord of the ritual order, and this Baresman, having the Zaothra with it, and the girdle with it, spread out with sanctity, the holy ritual chief, and we worship Apãm-napâ<i>t</i> (the son of waters).</p>
