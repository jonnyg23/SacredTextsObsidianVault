 <p>1. We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order, who disposes (all) aright, the greatest Yazad, who is also the most beneficent, and the one who causes the settlements to advance, the creator of good creatures; yea, we worship Him with these offered Zaothras, and with truthfully and scrupulously delivered words; and we worship every holy Yazad of the heaven (as well)!</p>  
 <p>2. And we worship Zarathu<i>s</i>tra Spitâma in our sacrifice, the holy lord of the ritual order with these Zaothras, and with faithfully delivered words; and we worship every holy earthly Yazad as we worship him; and we worship also the Fravashi of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra Spitâma, the saint. And we worship the utterances of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra and his religion, his faith and his lore.</p>  
 <p>3. And we worship the former religions of the world <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">2</font></a> devoted to Righteousness which were instituted</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>at the creation, the holy religions of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent and glorious. And we worship Vohu Manah (the Good Mind), and Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and Khshathra-vairya, the Kingdom to be desired, and the good and bountiful Âramaiti (true piety in the believers), and Haurvatâ<i>t</i> and Ameretatâ<i>t</i> (our Weal and Immortality).</p>  
 <p>4. Yea, we worship the Creator Ahura Mazda and the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son, and the good waters which are Mazda-made and holy, and the resplendent sun of the swift horses, and the moon with the seed of cattle (in his beams <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1</font></a>); and we worship the star Ti<i>s</i>trya, the lustrous and glorious; and we worship the soul of the Kine of blessed endowment, (5) and its Creator Ahura Mazda; and we worship Mithra of the wide pastures, and Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and Rashnu the most just, and the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and the Blow-of-victory Ahura-given (as it is). And we worship Râman <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra, and the bounteous Wind of blessed gift, (6) and (its) Creator Ahura Mazda, and the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and the good Blessedness and Ar<i>s</i>tâ<i>t</i>.</p>  
 <p>And we worship the heaven and the earth of blessed gift, and the bounteous Mãthra, and the stars without beginning (to their course), self-disposing as they are.</p>  
 <p>7. And we worship the glorious works of Righteousness in which the souls of the dead find satisfaction and delight [(Pâzand) which are the Fravashis</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the saints], and we worship (Heaven) the best world of the saints, shining, all glorious.</p>  
 <p>8. And we worship the two, the milk-offering and the libation, the two which cause the waters to flow forth <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the plants to flourish, the two foes who meet the Dragon <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1</font></a> demon-made; and who are set to meet, to defeat, and to put to flight, that cheat <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Pairika, and to contradict the insulting malice of the Ashemaogha (the persecuting heretic) and that of the unholy tyrant full of death <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>9. And we worship all waters and all plants, and all good men and all good women. And we worship all these Yazads, heavenly and earthly <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who are beneficent and holy.</p>  
 <p>10. And we worship thee (our) dwelling-place who art the (earth, our) bounteous Âramaiti <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and Thee, O Ahura Mazda, O holy Lord of this abode <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">6</font></a>! which is the home of healthy herds and healthy men, and of those who are both endowed with health and lover(s) of the ritual right.</p>  
 <p>(Response of the individual worshipper (?).) Wherefore whichever of persons, or whatever of bodily influences, is most helpful and preserving in that abode (thus owned by Mazda) let this meet me in mine abode, and there may it abide for summer and for winter. (Or <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">7</font></a> let that one meet me in all my house,</p>

 <p>in whom are what of influences are the most mighty power for the body and the person's life; yea, let that one meet me there, and there abide for summer and for winter (for my help)!)</p>
