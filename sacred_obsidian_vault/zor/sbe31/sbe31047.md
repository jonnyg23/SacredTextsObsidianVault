 <p>1. And we worship the Bountiful Immortals with our sacrifice, who rule aright, and who dispose of all aright; and we worship this Haoma, this flesh and branch, (2) and these Zaothras for the good waters, having the Haoma with them, and the flesh with them, and Hadhânaêpata, and lifted up with sanctity, and we worship the Haoma-water for the beneficial waters; and we worship the two, the stone mortar and the iron mortar; (3) and we worship this plant for the Baresman and the well-timed prayer for blessings which has approached (in its proper place within the ritual course), and also both the remembrance and the practice <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1162"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and the heard recital of the Gâthas, and the well-timed prayer for blessings of the holy lord of the ritual order which has approached, and these wood-billets with the perfume, (even) thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! and we worship all good objects which are Mazda-made, and which contain (and are) the seed of Righteousness.</p>  
 <p>4. And we worship Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice, the resplendent, the glorious, and the Bountiful Immortals who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, and Mithra of the wide pastures and Râman <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra; and we worship the shining sun, the resplendent, the immortal, of the fleet horses.</p>

 <p>5. And we worship the holy wind which works on high, placed higher than the other creatures in the creation; and we worship this which is thine, O Vayu! and which appertains to the Spe<i>n</i>ta Mainyu within thee; and we worship the most true religious Knowledge, Mazda-made and holy, and the good Mazdayasnian law.</p>  
 <p>6. And we worship the Mãthra Spe<i>n</i>ta verily glorious (as it is), even the law pronounced against the Daêvas, the Zarathu<i>s</i>trian law, and its long descent <a name="fr_1172"></a><a href="#fn_1163"><font size="1">1</font></a>; yea, we worship the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and the Mãthra which is heart-devoted and bounteous (imparting heart's devotion to the saint); yea, we worship the Mazdayasnian Religion maintained in the understanding <a name="fr_1173"></a><a href="#fn_1164"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the saint; and we honour that science which is the Mãthra Spe<i>n</i>ta, and the innate understanding Mazda-made, and the derived understanding, heard with ear, and Mazda-made.</p>  
 <p>7. Yea, we worship thee, the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! the holy lord of the ritual order; and we worship all the Fires, and Mount Ushi-darena (which holds the light <a name="fr_1174"></a><a href="#fn_1165"><font size="1">3</font></a>) Mazda-made and holy, the Yazad mount, brilliant with sanctity. 8. And we worship every holy spiritual <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1166"><font size="1">4</font></a> Yazad; and every holy earthly Yazad (who exists)!</p>
