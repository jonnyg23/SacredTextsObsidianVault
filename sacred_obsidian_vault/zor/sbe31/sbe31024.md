 <p><a name="fn_920"></a><a href="sbe31024.htm#fr_923">203:1</a> Referring yâs to its more original sense. Or read, 'I desire the approach of' the various objects of worship, which may be correct, as we understand the genius of each several object to be invoked. Aside from this, a desire 'to approach' seems quite necessary to fill out the sense here. Many of the objects referred to were already present, although some, like 'the mountains,' needed to be spiritually approached, or indeed invoked.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_921"></a><a href="sbe31024.htm#fr_924">203:2</a> Zaothra seems to me hardly a vocative here. If declined as other nouns, it would seem to be exceptionally a masculine; compare ahmya zaothrê below. I should feel constrained to regard it here as a masc. plural accusative (comp. haoma).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_922"></a><a href="sbe31024.htm#fr_926">203:3</a> If zaothrê is not a loc. masc. it may be used with the loc. masc. pronoun irregularly. It would then equal Zaothraya. The letter <a name="img_20300"></a>
