 <p>1. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of the order of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for the Ushahina, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and to Bere<i>g</i>ya and Nmânya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order. 2. Propitiation be to Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, endowed with recompense, smiting with the blow of victory, and causing the settlements to advance and to increase.</p>  
 <p>3, 4. (See Gâh I, 3, 4.) 5. We sacrifice to Ushahina, the holy lord of the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the beautiful Aurora, and to the dawn of morning; yea, we sacrifice to the morning, the shining <a name="fr_1586"></a><a href="#fn_1558"><font size="1">2</font></a>, of the glittering horses, having the men of forethought (as its servants), yea, having men of forethought and heroes (awake and at their work), to the morning which gives light within the house <a name="fr_1587"></a><a href="#fn_1559"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And we sacrifice to the lights of dawn which are radiant with their light and fleetest horses which sweep over (?) the sevenfold earth. And we sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Good Mind, and to Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to Khshathra-vairya, and to Âramaiti, the bounteous and the good.</p>  
 <p>6. And we sacrifice to Bere<i>g</i>ya, even the holy lord of the ritual order, even to Nmânya with the longing desire for the good Asha, and with the longing desire for the good Mazdayasnian law, for the worship</p>

 <p>and homage of Nmânya, the lord. 7. And we sacrifice to Sraosha, and to Rashnu, the most just, and to Ar<i>s</i>tâ<i>t</i>, who causes the settlements to advance and to increase. 8, 9. (See Gâh I, 9, 10.) 10. And I bless the sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, endowed with sanctity, smiting with the blow of victory, and who causes the settlements to advance; and I bless the sacrifice of Rashnu, the most just, and that of Ar<i>s</i>tâ<i>t</i>, who causes the settlements to advance and to increase <a name="fr_1588"></a><a href="#fn_1560"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
