 <p><font size="-1">This composition differs from that in XXX as descending from the more general to the particular, and from the doctrinal to the practical. One might even trace an immediate connection, urvâtâ occurring in the last verse of the one and in the first of the other. It is, of course, very possible that the verses before us are only a remnant of those which originally constituted the piece, and here and there one may have been interpolated from other scriptures.</font></p>  
 <p>Some writers prefer to assume a loss of the original text or an addition to it at the smallest change of tone, and to assume also a change of subject with it. I do not regard it as very useful to lay too much stress upon these occurrences.</p>  
 <p>Whether caused by gaps or interpolations, they do not at all affect the fact that the subject-matter is homogeneous and contemporaneous; and, probably, like many more modern compositions, the verses gain in rhetorical effect by being weeded of repetitions.</p>  
 <p>We might divide as follows 1, 2, an address to the congregation to be connected with XXX as its concluding words; 3-5, an address to Ahura; 6, an address to the faithful; 7-17, to Ahura; 18, to the congregation; 19, to Ahura; 20, 21, to the congregation; 22, an addition.</p>  
 <p>Treating the section then as containing homogeneous matter which combines well into a unit, I proceed as follows. The sage chants his hymn in the presence of the multitude as before.</p>  
 <p>1. He declares that while he is reciting things unwillingly heard by the hostile party, those same truths are valued as the best of existing things by those who are sincerely devoted to Mazda, their good disposition quickening their perception.</p>  
 <p>2. He then declares that if the truths of the holy Religion are not yet clearly seen by the instrumentalities provided, he will approach them still more effectively in accordance with the especial regulation of the spiritual chieftainship, which Ahura Mazda had prepared in response to the lament of the soul of the Kine; i.e. of the Iranian herds and people possibly as representing the entire holy, or clean, creation upon earth. And he further asserts that this regulation concerns the struggle of the two parties, and will bring the cause of the Righteous Order to a successful issue.</p>  
 <p>3. Changing his address to Ahura, he proceeds to pray at once</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">for that satisfying decision which would be the natural result of the regulation just promised, and which could be given by the instrumentality of the Sacred Fire and holy ritual, affording mental keenness to the two contending parties. And he declares that this is the doctrine which should be proclaimed for the conversion of mankind. Here we observe that the Zarathu<i>s</i>trian Mazda-worship was aggressive and missionary in its spirit, and in a proselyting sense by no means indifferent to the final destiny of the Gentile world. (The later and traditional system announced indeed the restoration and so the conversion of all men, and that not as an object proposed to the efforts of charity, but as a necessary result (so by inference; see Bundahi<i>s</i> (West), pp. 126, 129). I can find no trace of this in the Gâthas.</font></p>  
 <p>Here we have only the effort to convert.)</p>  
 <p>4. Addressing all the Bountiful Immortals, and with the striking title of the Ahuras of Mazda, he prays for the establishment of the 'mighty kingdom' by means of which he might overcome the personified and aggressive falsehood of the opposing and persecuting Daêva-worshippers.</p>  
 <p>5. In order to enable himself to fulfil his mission, he asks for prophetic and judicial knowledge as to what ought to be done, or as to what is about to happen in the immediate future.</p>  
 <p>6. He lauds the Mãthra which we may suppose him to recognise as delivered to him afresh in answer to his prayer for prophetic light, and he praises co-ordinately with the Word of God that Sovereign Authority of Ahura, which was to be established in a kingdom where goodness would increase, and be prosperous, if not predominant.</p>  
 <p>7. He takes the heavenly bodies as evidence of the wisdom of Him who created the Sacred Order personified as the 'Immortal' Asha, and also the Good Mind, his equal. And he ascribes the support and extension of their hallowing influence to Ahura, because He never changes.</p>  
 <p>8. He reiterates, in expressions which form the basis for another hymn, his conception of Mazda as the supreme object of devotion, as the father of the Good Mind personified as His child, as the creator of the Righteous Order, and as both the controller and the judge of human actions. Therefore the Good Mind and Righteousness are to be worshipped as standing in the closest possible relation to him.</p>  
 <p>9. He ascribes the 'Immortal' Piety to Him as well. She is His own, and elsewhere His own daughter. He is declared, as in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">chapter XXIX, to be the Creator of the Kine, and of Understanding, (His own intelligence), to guide Him in the disposition of the destiny of the holy Iranian people. And according to it He makes the path for the Kine, which as a matter of course has no meaning as applied to bucolics, but is full of meaning when read in view of the wail of the Kine's Soul in chapter XXIX, and of the intervention of the Deity in her behalf, for He actually appointed Zarathu<i>s</i>tra to meet her necessities. He adds, however, that her free choice is not abolished by the construction 'of this path.' It is elsewhere called the 'religion of the Saviour-prophets,' and she is free to proceed in it, guided by the first prophet, the ideal husbandman, or she can follow the profaner nomad.</font></p>  
 <p>10. But he thankfully exclaims that she does not pause in indecision, nor does she choose perversely. She selects the guardian appointed by Ahura, the diligent and pious husbandman, elsewhere identified with Zarathu<i>s</i>tra himself. He is rich with the spiritual wealth of the Good Mind; and she rejects in his favour the idle and free-booting nomad, excluding him from all share in the sacred religious system.</p>  
 <p>11. The composer then delineates the struggle which inevitably follows this establishment of the needed means of deliverance. When Mazda has completed the inspiration of doctrines, teaching whither the one endowed with free volition (like the Kine [verse 9]) should direct his choice in action (12), there upon the spot, as it were, the ignorant Daêva-worshipper makes himself heard beside God's spokesman. But the prophet is consoled by the reflection that the pious mind will not question the evil Spirit, or the good Spirit superficially. It searches both the Spirits, questioning them, as it were, in their very home. (Hence it is that Ahura speaks so fully concerning Angra Mainyu, delineating his opposition to Him in extended detail. See XLV, 2.)</p>  
 <p>13. The composer is still more reanimated by the certainty that Ahura is gazing into the depths of all questions, trivial and profound; which is to say that he observes most closely the men who are discussing them. And he declares that he also sees the cruel injustice of the punishments which the tyrants visit upon the smallest offences, as well as the more flagrant wickedness of those who persecute his adherents without even a pretence of justice.</p>  
 <p>14. As he recalls the divine forecasting omniscience, he asks Ahura once more concerning the future which was close at hand with its portentous events. And he inquires as to the nature of the veritable and not iniquitous confessions, which were properly due to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">be made by the righteous believer in order to avert the impending calamities, and secure the upper hand in the struggle for the throne. And he inquires also as to the proper expiatory prayers which were to be offered by the believer. He does not however fail to inquire analogously concerning the wicked, nor to ask how they, as well as the righteous, shall be situated in the final consummation.</font></p>  
 <p>15. Particularising as to the latter, he asks what shall be the punishment for those who succeed in installing an evil monarch, one of the Daêva-party, a prince who cannot exist without the ruthless persecution of the pious husbandman, who repudiates the Lie-demon presiding over the counsels and efforts of the opposing religion.</p>  
 <p>16. He further asks how and by what actions the wise man may become like Ahura, or his faithful adherent, the expressions used implying deep religious feeling.</p>  
 <p>17. Striving to arouse the perceptions of his hearers, he inquires as to which one of the two parties holds to the greater or more important religion, the disciple of Asha, the personified Righteous Order Ahura's immediate creature (see above), or the opponent. And he prays that no blind guide may deceive him, or those who belong to him, 'but that the enlightened, yea, even Ahura Himself, may speak to him, and become the indicator and demonstrator of the truth.'</p>  
 <p>18. Closing this address to the Deity, he turns to the congregation, vehemently forbidding them to listen to the doctrines of his opponents, warning them against the ruin and death which would ensue, and fiercely appealing to the sword.</p>  
 <p>19. Once more addressing Ahura, he prays that they may on the contrary listen to Him who has power to vindicate the conscientious Zarathu<i>s</i>trian, inculcating veracity upon him, and encouraging him in its practice; and this by means of the holy sacrifice, or ordeal of the Fire.</p>  
 <p>20. He solemnly warns those who would seduce the righteous of their ultimate fate, and adds that their sorrows will be self-induced, if they persevere in their hostility. Their own consciences (as we see from Ya<i>s</i>t XXII) would not only bring on their ruin, but would form a part of their punishment.</p>  
 <p>21. On the other hand, happiness and immortality will be the lot of the faithful. And these 'eternal two' will be given to them, accompanied by the fulness of Righteousness, and the exuberant vigour of the Good and Kindly Mind within them and bestowing its blessings upon them.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">22. In conclusion he apostrophises the manifest certainty of the truths which he declares, and, addressing Ahura, animates the faithful not merely with the hope of the objective recompense, but with the prospect of being efficient as servants of God.</font></p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Translation.</font></p>  
 <p>1. These doctrines (therefore) we are earnestly declaring to You as we recite them forth from memory, words (till now) unheard <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">1</font></a> (with faith) by those who by means of the doctrinal vows <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the harmful Lie are delivering the settlements of Righteousness to death, but words which are of the best unto those who are heartily devoted to Ahura <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. And if by this means the indubitable truths <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">4</font></a> are not seen in the soul <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">5</font></a>, then as better (than these words) I will come to you all (in my person) with</p>

 <p>that power, and in that way according to which Ahura Mazda knows and appoints His ruler <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that ruler over both the two (struggling) bands <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in order that we (in obedience to him), may live according to Righteousness <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. And that keenness, that deciding satisfaction, which Thou hast given by (Thy) Spirit <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and (Thy) Fire, and by Thy Righteousness (itself) to the two battling <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">5</font></a> (sides), do Thou declare unto us, O Ahura! that vow which is for the seeing <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">6</font></a> (as those endowed with mental light). Yea, do Thou declare this that we may know it, O Mazda! With the tongue of Thy mouth do Thou speak it (that as I preach its mighty truths <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">7</font></a>) I may make all the living believers <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">8</font></a>!</p>

 <p>4. And when the Divine Righteousness shall be inclined to my appeal <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and with him all those (remaining ones who are as) Mazda's <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">2</font></a> (own) Ahuras then with the blessedness (of the reward), with (my) Piety and with Thy Best Mind (active within me), I will pray <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">3</font></a> for that mighty Kingdom by whose force <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">4</font></a> we may smite the Lie-demon <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. Aye, do Thou tell me that I may discern it, since through (Thy) Righteous Order the better (lot) is <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">6</font></a> given; tell me this that I may know it with (Thy) Good Mind (as it speaks within me), and that I may ponder <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">7</font></a> that to which these my truths <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">8</font></a> belong (and</p>

Hübschmann preferring 'wir sprechen Worte nicht anhörbar für diejenigen' (Casuslehre, s. 223). A dative of the pronoun is certainly more natural than the ablative as inst. But on the whole agushtâ seems better in its ordinary sense, although in so rendering we are obliged to supply a word.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_178"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_179">40:3</a> The Pahlavi may be rendered as follows: Both these benedictions, which I (we) recite as yours [the Avesta and Zand], we are teaching by word to him who is no hearer, [to the destroyer of sanctity (the heretical persecutor) [ ]]. Those who utterly slay the world of righteousness through the benedictions of the Drû<i>g</i> [ ], even those might be an excellent thing, if they would cause progress in what belongs to Aûharmazd.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_179"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_180">40:4</a> Read perhaps advayâo; see the Pahlavi. Otherwise 'the way' advâo as panthâs; but the participle <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">*</font></a> does not agree. Compare for meaning kavím ádvayantam, sákhâ ádvayâs.*</p>
 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_181">40:5</a> The Pahlavi renders 'in the soul' freely by 'believes:' Pavan nikîri<i>s</i>nŏ la hêmnunê<i>d</i>ŏ a<i>s</i> pavan zak î agûmânîkîh. The general indications are to be observed.</p>

The Pahlavi translator has avŏ patkâr<i>d</i>ârânŏ shnâkhtârîh; so uniformly. In Y. XLIII, 12, K5 and most MSS., except K4, and likewise excepting the printed B.V.S., read ranôibyô which excludes the dual form; also the fire is not mentioned there. It is however far from impossible that the present Pahlavi translation may be a growth beyond an earlier one more in accordance with ara<i>n</i>i. The strivers, or fighters, might describe the two rubbing-sticks (?).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_187"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_188">41:6</a> Aîmar (sic), vi<i>g</i>âr<i>d</i>âr. This meaning suits the connection admirably. The word is otherwise difficult, and this general sense is followed by some who do not so often cite the Pahlavi translator.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_189"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_190">41:8</a> Roth, 'wie ich alle lebenden bekehren soll.' So also the general indication of the Pahlavi translator. Pavan hûzvânŏ î Lak—zîvandakân harvist-gûn hêmnund. Observe that the religious system contemplated universal proselytism.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_190"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_191">42:1</a> The general indications karîtûntâr and bavîhûnam point to the proper sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_191"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_192">42:2</a> Or, with Roth, 'wenn wirklich sich rufen lassen die Ahura-Mazdas.' Otherwise, 'O Mazda and the Ahuras.' Hübschmann also maintained that Mazd<i>a</i>u was here a plural; (see his Y. XXX, 10.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_194"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_195">42:5</a> The Pahlavi may he rendered thus: Since in that dispensation [in the final body], I shall be an invoker of Ashavahi<i>s</i>t, and of Aûharmazd also [ ]; and of her who is veneration 'Spendarmad' [ ], I desire [that best of things which is the reward], of Vohûman.

 <p><a name="fn_196"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_197">42:7</a> I am far from sure that the indication of the Pahlavi is not correct here. According to it, when properly understood, we have here an accusative with the infinitive; 'that I should establish.' Its own translation is however avŏ li yehabûnâi. Me<i>n</i> = man or mãm; <i>e</i><i>n</i>(g) = ã the nasal vowel. The Pahl. translator recognises m<i>e</i><i>n</i> elsewhere as = mîni<i>s</i>nŏ. It was from no ignorance (!) of the particular word that he wrote 'li' here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_197"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_198">42:8</a> Or 'my prophet;' comp. <i>ri</i>shi; that is, 'that with which my prophet is concerned.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_198"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_199">43:1</a> Or, possibly, 'which shall not be, or which shall be.' Is the subjunctive here used to express obligation? Roth has 'was nicht sein soll oder was sein soll.' Ner. may be rendered as follows: Tell it to me distinctly [ ], that which is the highest gift, and which is given to me through sanctity; [that is, because duty and righteousness are fulfilled by me, the best gift of thy reward (is gained) by this means; but how is it possible to make it (actually) one's own?]. Grant me the knowledge through the best mind; [that is, declare that intelligence to me which comes through good conduct], and by which also safety is (secured) to me [ ]. And declare either that which is not, or that which is, O Great Wise One, the Lord! [ ].</p>
 <p><a name="fn_199"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_200">43:2</a> An interval of silence seems here to intervene, or lost verses leave an unexplained transition. The sage turns again to the people.</p>

 <p>Ner. may be rendered as follows: Thus thou wert thought at the first by me, O Great Wise One, the Lord! when thou wert engaged in the production of Gvahmana [ ]. In which (production) they apprehend the father of the Best Mind when they observe him with a full-faced look [ ]. (And thou art the father) of that creation which is manifestly righteous; [that is, thou makest the purer creation good in conduct]. Thou art a King in the world as to action; [that is, where it is fitting to confer a benefit, and also where it is fitting to inflict a punishment, in each of these thou art capable].</p>
 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_213">45:1</a> His spe<i>n</i>ta mainyu; otherwise 'spiritual (understanding),' but mainyu is used elsewhere (verse 3 and 7) alone, and certainly not as an adjective even with a substantive understood. The rendering 'spirit' as 'Thy spirit' is suspiciously significant; but what is the help? We are forced by grammar so to translate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_213"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_214">45:2</a> The ablative has this force as in Ashâ<i>t</i> ha<i>k</i>â.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_215">45:3</a> I can hardly accede to an infinitive here: -tê is a rare infinitive termination in Gâthic. Also the infinitive seldom falls to the end of the sentence. The Pahlavi has yâtûnê<i>d</i>, a present; but the Pahlavi should never be positively cited for the forms, as it is free.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_215"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_216">45:4</a> Observe that we are forced by every dictate of logic and common sense to avoid the commonplace rendering here. Cattle do not have 'paths' made for them, nor do they cry aloud for an overseer, or complain at the appointment of one who does not appear to them promising; nor is it one main effort of religion 'to content the soul of cattle.' Cattle, as the chief article of wealth, are taken to signify all civic life. The 'path' is the path for the people to walk in, securing safety for soul and life and herds. The adhvan is 'the way' which 'is the religious characteristics and teachings of the prophets' (XXXIV, 13).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_217">45:5</a> Observe that this cow (some would say 'ox') chooses her master, unlike other cattle. But observe also, what is more interesting, that she seems reconciled to the guardian appointed by Ahura. In Y. XXIX, 9, she actually 'wept' at the naming of the pusillanimous Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, desiring a kingly potentate. Now, however, we see that she must have dried her tears, as she is satisfied with the simple workman whom he represents notwithstanding high rank.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_225">46:6</a> The Pahlavi has the following interesting gloss: [That is, even the actions and teachings of the pious are given forth by thee; and this was also given in this wisdom of thy mind]. And when there is a person in whom there is a desire for the other world, that desire is granted to him by thee; [that is, what is necessary when he is arriving in the other world, this which is thus required (or desired) by him at that time, is given by thee—through that which is thy mind and wisdom]. Although not able to follow the indications of the Pahlavi fully, I think that there is no question but that we have an important statement in the last line. It does not seem to me possible to render less profoundly than 'where the wisher may place his choices,' his religious preferences and beliefs, including all moral volition.</p>

[Over sins and righteous actions thou art in one way, everywhere and again, the Lord.] The concretes here may give the right indication.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_245"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_246">49:1</a> Neryosangh may be rendered as follows: Thus I ask thee: What is for him who seizes upon destruction, and who provides the sovereignty for the wicked [ ], and commits that evil action.

 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_249">49:4</a> I render the Sanskrit of Neryosangh thus (it improves on the Pahlavi): I ask (thee) thus: How [dost thou bestow] the sovereignty upon one when he is beneficently wise? [ ] (in the body) of him who, through the increase of sanctity, is no opposer (of prosperity) in provinces or villages; [that is, with him who is discharging his duty and performing acts of sanctity. He is this teacher's teacher, he does not contend]. Thine equal, O Great Wise One, the Lord! thus is he verily, who (is such) in action, [who is thus Thine equal through activity].</p>

 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_253">50:3</a> Or with others 'be Thou'; but the gloss of the Pahlavi translation contains an explanation which may well afford the true solution as in so many instances in which he is both consciously and inadvertently followed. It reads [aîghmânŏ barâ khavîtûnînŏ—]. May we not see an az = ah in the form, or at least a separate Iranian root, as also in azdâ (L, r), where the Pahlavi translator gives the same explanation admirably suited to the context.</p>  
 <p>Neryosangh: Which is it, the pure of soul, or the wicked who teaches as the great one? [ ] The intelligent speaks to the intelligent [ ]. Be not thou ignorant after this; because (ignorance is) from the deceiver. Instruct us, O Great Wise One, the Lord! [ ] Furnish us with a sign through the Best Mind; [that is, make me steadfast in good conduct through the recognition of the dîn]. Such renderings may suffice to show that an examination of these ancient translations in our search for hints is imperative. Yet the practice prevails of omitting a knowledge of the Pahlavi language, on which not only the oldest translation of the Avesta, but also the irregular Sanskrit of Neryosangh, closely depends.</p>

The vocative, strange as it may seem, does not necessarily exclude Ahura, as the subject referred to in y<i>e</i>. Several analogous cases occur. The Deity may here however represent His prophet, as the Daêvas do their worshippers in the later Avesta. Some writers force the language into a reference to the human subject for the sake of the greatly to be desired simplicity.</p>  
 <p>One places Ahurâ in the instrumental, a case in which the Almighty seldom appears. The above translation needs no alternative, as the language would be the same whoever y<i>e</i> refers to.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_261">51:4</a> See note on verse 3, and read as alternative 'from the two ara<i>n</i>i.' As an inferior rendering of tradition I cite Neryosangh here: The matter should be heard (taking gûshtâ as a third singular in a subjunctive sense); [that is, a study should be made of it by him] who is even (in any degree) acquainted with the righteous design of Hormi<i>g</i>da for both the worlds. He is independent in the literal truth of his words, in his freedom of speech, [and his fear has no existence]. Thy brilliant fire gives the explanation to the contenders. [It makes purity and impurity evident.]</p>

 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe31009.htm#fr_263">52:2</a> I differ with diffidence from the hint of the Pahlavi here (as elsewhere). It has shîvan = tears, which however is free for 'calamity' and 'sorrow.' Nom. sing.; see its position.</p>
