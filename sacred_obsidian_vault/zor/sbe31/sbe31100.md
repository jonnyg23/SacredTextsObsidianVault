 <p>1. We worship Ahura Mazda as the best <a name="fr_1521"></a><a href="#fn_1504"><font size="1">4</font></a> (worship to be offered in our gifts). We worship the Amesha Spe<i>n</i>ta (once more, and as) the best. We worship Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta (who is Righteousness the Best). And we sacrifice to those (prayers) which are evident as the best; that is, the Praises of the Yasnas.</p>  
 <p>Also we sacrifice to that best wish, which is that of Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta, and we worship Heaven, which is the best world of the saints, bright and all-glorious; and we sacrifice likewise to that best approach which leads to <a name="fr_1522"></a><a href="#fn_1505"><font size="1">5</font></a> it. 2.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1503"></a><a href="sbe31100.htm#fr_1520">363:3</a> This piece from the later Avesta follows Y. LIII, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, and has reference to its expressions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1504"></a><a href="sbe31100.htm#fr_1521">363:4</a> It is an important suggestion which holds vahi<i>s</i>tem as equal to 'saying vahi<i>s</i>tem,' in allusion to the Vahi<i>s</i>ta î<i>s</i>ti<i>s</i>; but as the word is inflected further on (see vahi<i>s</i>tahê), and as it moreover once applies to Asha, as Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta, it is better to render it as having adjective application throughout, being none the less, of course, an intentional echo of the first word of Y. LIII, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1505"></a><a href="sbe31100.htm#fr_1522">363:5</a> Or, 'of it.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1506"></a><a href="sbe31100.htm#fr_1523">364:1</a> Possibly 'between them,' meaning the Gâthas which are so placed.</p>
