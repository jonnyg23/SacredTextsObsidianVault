Who brings pollutions to this (Thy flame) him wilt Thou cover with pollutions (in his turn). 2.

 <p>most adored. Yea, may’st thou approach to aid us in this our greatest (undertaking) among the efforts of our zeal.</p>

The Fire of Ahura Mazda art thou verily <a name="fr_1199"></a><a href="#fn_1189"><font size="1">1</font></a>; yea, the most bounteous one of His Spirit, wherefore Thine is the most potent of all names (for grace), O Fire of the Lord! 4.

 <p>5. We therefore bow before Thee, and we direct our prayers to Thee with confessions of our guilt, O Ahura Mazda! with all the good thoughts (which Thou dost inspire), with all the words well said, and the deeds well done, with these would we approach Thee. 6. And to Thy most beauteous body <a name="fr_1200"></a><a href="#fn_1190"><font size="1">2</font></a> do we make our deep acknowledgments, O Ahura Mazda! to those stars (which are Thy body); and to that one, the highest of the high, [such as the sun was called]!</p>
