 <p>1. To Ahura Mazda would we present <a name="fr_1455"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">4</font></a> our offered Haomas and that which is lifted up, as the most</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a></p>  
 <p>beneficial to Verethraghna (the blow of victory) which furthers the settlements; and that which is offered to the good and holy king, and that which is offered to the holy ruler which rules according to, or in the ritual, and we make known our Haomas to the Bountiful Immortals, and to the good waters; and we present our Haomas each to (our) own soul <a name="fr_1456"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and we announce our Haomas in our celebration to the entire creation of the holy (and the clean).</p>  
 <p>2. Yea, we present these Haomas and Haoma-implements, and these spread mats, and these Myazdas, these stones, the first in the creation, the stone mortar brought here with the yellow <a name="fr_1457"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">2</font></a> Haoma in it, and the iron mortar brought here with the yellow Haoma in it, this Haoma-water, and this Baresman spread with sanctity, (3) these bodies, and (their) forces, these striving Zaothras (that seek to find Thy grace), this holy Haoma, and the flesh, and the holy man, and the saint's innate thoughts, even the Saoshya<i>n</i>ts’ innate thoughts.</p>  
 <p>And we present this fresh milk as an offering, now lifted up with sanctity, and this Hadhânaêpata plant, lifted up with sanctity; (4) and we offer, and present these Zaothras with our celebration, having the Haoma with them, and the milk, and the Hadhânaêpata, to the good waters and offered up with piety. And we present the Haoma-water in our celebrations to the good waters, and both the stone and the iron mortar, (5) and this branch for the Baresman, and the prayer for blessings uttered at the fitting moment which has approached (for our help in its order with the prayers), and the recollection</p>

 <p>and practice of the good Mazdayasnian law, and the heard recital of the Gâthas, the well-timed prayer for blessings as it comes uttered by the saint (and for our help), and ruling (while it is spoken) as a ritual lord, and these wood-billets, and the perfume even Thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! and all good objects (which are ours), and Mazda-made, and which have the seed of sanctity (or are that seed).</p>  
 <p>6. Yea, these we make known and we announce in this our celebration to Ahura Mazda (as our gift), and to Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and to Ashi (who is the recompense),and to Rashnu the most just, and to Mithra of the wide pastures, and to the Bountiful Immortals, and the Fravashis of the saints, and to their souls, and to the Fire of Ahura Mazda, the lord, and to the lofty lord (the Apãm-napâ<i>t</i>?), and to the Myazda, the lord, and to the well-timed prayer for blessings as it rules in the order of our prayers, for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and adoration of the entire creation of the holy (and the clean). 7. Yea, these we make known in this our celebration hereby for the Fravashi of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra Spitâma, the saint, for its sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and to the (Fravashi) of Anghuyu (?) <a name="fr_1458"></a><a href="#fn_1444"><font size="1">1</font></a> who hath loved righteousness, together with all the holy Fravashis of the saints, of those now dead, and of those of the living, and of those of men unborn, of the prophets that shall serve us, bringing on the renovation of the completed world. 8-11, see verses 2-5.</p>  
 <p>12. Yea, we would make these known hereby in our celebrations to the Bountiful Immortals, who rule</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a></p>  
 <p>aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, the ever-living, ever-helpful, who are good (?), and bestowers of the good, who dwell with the Good Mind [(Pâzand) for they who are the Bountiful Immortals abide with the Good Mind, they who rule aright, and dispose (of all) aright, for thence they are regulated, and thence they arose, (namely,) from the Good Mind <a name="fr_1459"></a><a href="#fn_1445"><font size="1">1</font></a>]. 13. And we make known these our celebrations as the more promotive for this <a name="fr_1460"></a><a href="#fn_1446"><font size="1">2</font></a> house, for the furtherance of this house, and as benefits for this house, because of the increase of this household, as overcoming the restrictions which impede this household, and as overcoming the harmful malice which may mar this house, to bless its herds, and its retainers, born, and yet to be born, for the saints of the house as it was aforetime, of it as it <a name="fr_1461"></a><a href="#fn_1447"><font size="1">3</font></a> stands here now, and to which we likewise now belong as the Saoshya<i>n</i>ts of the provinces, (14) [which (is that we are Saoshya<i>n</i>ts) for the saints who do good deeds, and of the female saints who do good deeds, and of the saints who do the deeds conspicuously good, and of the females likewise thus, of the saints who do good deeds upon good deeds, and of the females thus the same] 15. And we make these known in our celebrations to the good Fravashis of the saints which are formidable and overwhelming in their aid. 16. And we make these known in our celebrations hereby to Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and to the good</p>

 <p>19. (Sp. XIII.) Yea, we make that known which is lifted up in offering, and which is the Avesta <a name="fr_1462"></a><a href="#fn_1448"><font size="1">1</font></a> as the holy Ahura Mazda directed that it should be said, and as Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, the holy, directed, and as I, the priest, who am acquainted with their sacrifice and homage, am now letting it be known. I who understand the lawful and legitimate Avesta <a name="fr_1463"></a><a href="#fn_1449"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the ritual prescripts (20) for Your sacrifice, homage, and propitiation, O Ye who are the Bountiful Immortals, and for our preparation (?), and for the success of our well-uttered prayer for blessings, for victory, sanctification, and the well-being of our souls, (of ours), for (we are) the holy Saoshya<i>n</i>ts.</p>  
 <p>21. Yea, we make these known in our celebrations here, and we offer them to Him who is Ahura Mazda, of all the greatest, the master and the Lord.</p>
