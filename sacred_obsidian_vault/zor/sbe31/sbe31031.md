 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Zend Avesta, Part III (SBE31)</i>, L.H. Mills, tr. [1886], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">YASNA IX.</h3>  <h4 align="center">THE HÔM YA<i>S</i>T.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">The Haoma-ya<i>s</i>t has claims to antiquity (owing to its subject, but not to its dialect), next after the Srô<i>s</i>-ya<i>s</i>t. H(a)oma = Soma, as a deity, flourished not only before the Gâthas, but before the <i>Ri</i>ks of the Veda, in Aryan ages before Iranian and Indian became two peoples.</font></p>  
 <p>The astonishing circumstance has been elsewhere noted that a hymn, which is a reproduction of an Aryan original, should, notwithstanding its earlier characteristics, be necessarily assigned to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">a date much later than the Gâthas in which H(a)oma worship is not mentioned.</font></p>  
 <p>Probably on account of bitter animosities prevailing between their more southern neighbours and themselves, and the use of Soma by the Indians as a stimulant before battle, the Iranians of the Gâthic period had become lukewarm in their own H(a)oma worship. But that it should have revived, as we see it in this Ya<i>s</i>t, after having nearly or quite disappeared, is most interesting and remarkable. Was it definitively and purposely repudiated by Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, afterwards reviving as by a relapse? I do not think that it is well to hold to such deliberate and conscious antagonisms, and to a definite policy and action based upon them. The Soma-worship, like the sacramental acts of other religions which have become less practised after exaggerated attention, had simply fallen into neglect, increased by an aversion to practices outwardly similar to those of 'Daêva-worshippers.' The Ya<i>s</i>t is, of course, made up of fragments, which I have endeavoured to separate by lines. In the translation I have given a rhythmical rendering, necessarily somewhat free. It was difficult to import sufficient vivacity to the piece, while using a uselessly awkward literalness. The freedom, as elsewhere, often consists in adding words to point the sense, or round the rhythm. (Expressions for identical Zend words have been here, as elsewhere, purposely varied.)</p>  
 <p>1. At the hour of Hâvani <a name="fr_957"></a><a href="#fn_951"><font size="1">1</font></a>. H(a)oma came to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, as he served the (sacred) Fire, and sanctified (its flame), while he sang aloud the Gâthas.</p>  
 <p>And Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked him: Who art thou, O man! who art of all the incarnate world the most beautiful in Thine own body <a name="fr_958"></a><a href="#fn_952"><font size="1">2</font></a> of those whom I have seen, (thou) glorious [immortal]?</p>  
 <p>2. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer <a name="fr_959"></a><a href="#fn_953"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the holy one who driveth death afar: I am, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> H(a)oma, the holy and driving death afar; pray to me, O Spitâma, prepare me for the taste. Praise toward me in (Thy) praises as the other [Saoshya<i>n</i>ts] praise.</p>  
 <p>3. Thereupon spake Zarathu<i>s</i>tra: Unto H(a)oma be the praise <a name="fr_960"></a><a href="#fn_954"><font size="1">1</font></a>. What man, O H(a)oma! first prepared thee for the corporeal world? What blessedness was offered him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
 <p>4. Thereupon did H(a)oma answer me, he the holy one, and driving death afar: Vîvanghva<i>n</i>t <a name="fr_961"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">2</font></a> was the first of men who prepared me for the incarnate world. This blessedness was offered him; this gain did he acquire, that to him was born a son who was Yima, called the brilliant, (he of the many flocks, the most glorious of those yet born, the sunlike-one of men <a name="fr_962"></a><a href="#fn_956"><font size="1">3</font></a>), that he made from his authority both herds and people free from dying, both plants and waters free from drought, and men could eat imperishable food.</p>  
 <p>5. In the reign of Yima swift of motion was there neither cold nor heat, there was neither age nor death, nor envy <a name="fr_963"></a><a href="#fn_957"><font size="1">4</font></a> demon-made. Like fifteen-yearlings <a name="fr_964"></a><a href="#fn_958"><font size="1">5</font></a> walked the two forth, son and father, in their stature and their form, so long as Yima, son of Vîvanghva<i>n</i>t ruled, he of the many herds!</p>  
 <p>6. Who was the second man, O H(a)oma! who</p>

 <p>prepared thee for the corporeal world? What sanctity was offered him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
 <p>7. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer, he the holy one, and driving death afar: Âthwya <a name="fr_965"></a><a href="#fn_959"><font size="1">1</font></a> was the second who prepared me for the corporeal world. This blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire, that to him a son was born, Thraêtaona <a name="fr_966"></a><a href="#fn_960"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the heroic tribe,</p>  
 <p>8. Who smote the dragon Dahâka <a name="fr_967"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">3</font></a>, three jawed and triple-headed, six-eyed, with thousand powers, and of mighty strength, a lie-demon of <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_962"><font size="1">4</font></a> the Daêvas, evil for our settlements, and wicked, whom the evil spirit Angra Mainyu made as the most mighty Dru<i>g</i>(k) [against the corporeal world], and for the murder of (our) settlements, and to slay the (homes) of Asha!</p>  
 <p>9. Who was the third man, O H(a)oma! who prepared thee for the corporeal world? What blessedness was given him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
 <p>10. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer, the holy one, and driving death afar: Thrita <a name="fr_969"></a><a href="#fn_963"><font size="1">5</font></a>, [the most helpful of the Sâmas <a name="fr_970"></a><a href="#fn_964"><font size="1">6</font></a>], was the third man who prepared me for the corporeal world. This blessedness was given</p>

 <p>him, this gain did he acquire, that to him two sons were born, Urvâkhshaya and Keresâspa, the one a judge confirming order, the other a youth of great ascendant, ringlet-headed <a name="fr_972"></a><a href="#fn_966"><font size="1">1</font></a>, bludgeon-bearing.</p>  
 <p>11. He who smote the horny dragon swallowing men, and swallowing horses, poisonous, and green of colour, over which, as thick as thumbs are, greenish poison flowed aside, on whose back once Keresâspa cooked his meat in iron caldron at the noonday meal; and the deadly, scorched, upstarted <a name="fr_973"></a><a href="#fn_967"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and springing off, dashed out the water as it boiled. Headlong fled affrighted manly-minded <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_968"><font size="1">3</font></a> Keresâspa.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> O H(a)oma! for the corporeal world? What blessedness was given him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
 <p>13. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer, he the holy, and driving death afar: Pourushaspa <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_970"><font size="1">1</font></a> was the fourth man who prepared me for the corporeal world. This blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire, that thou, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! wast born to him, the just, in Pourushaspa's house, the D(a)êva's foe, the friend of Mazda's lore, (14) famed in Airyêna Vaê<i>g</i>ah; and thou, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra I didst recite the first the Ahuna-vairya <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_971"><font size="1">2</font></a>, four times intoning it, and with verses kept apart [(Pâzand) each time with louder and still louder voice].</p>  
 <p>15. And thou didst cause, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! all the demon-gods to vanish in the ground who aforetime flew about this earth in human shape (and power. This hast thou done), thou who hast been the strongest, and the staunchest, the most active, and the swiftest, and (in every deed) the most victorious in the two spirits’ <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_972"><font size="1">3</font></a> world.</p>  
 <p>16. Thereupon spake Zarathu<i>s</i>tra: Praise to H(a)oma. Good is H(a)oma, and the well-endowed, exact and righteous in its nature, and good inherently, and healing, beautiful of form, and good in deed, and most successful in its working <a name="fr_979"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">4</font></a>, golden-hued, with bending sprouts. As it is the best for drinking, so (through its sacred stimulus) is it the most nutritious <a name="fr_980"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">5</font></a> for the soul.</p>

 <p>26. Forth hath Mazda borne to thee, the star-bespangled girdle <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the spirit-made, the ancient one, the Mazdayasnian Faith.</p>

III, 32 (Sp. 305). That the dragon should begin to sweat (!) under the fire which was kindled upon his back, and which caused him to spring away, seems difficult. The process was not so deliberate. He was scorched, started, and then sprang. Also in Vend. III, 32 when the barley is produced the demons hardly 'sweat (with mental misery).' The idea is too advanced for the document. Burnouf's and Haug's 'hiss' was much better in both places. But I prefer the hint of the Pahlavi lâlâ vazlûn<i>d</i>. In Vend. III, 32 (Sp. 305), khîst-hômand.
