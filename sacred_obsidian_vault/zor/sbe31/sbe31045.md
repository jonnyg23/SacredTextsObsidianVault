 <p>1. I desire to approach with my praise <a name="fr_1161"></a><a href="#fn_1152"><font size="1">4</font></a> those Fravashis which have existed from of old, the Fravashis of the houses, and of the villages, of the communities, and of the provinces, which hold the</p>

 <p>heaven in its place apart, and the water, land, and cattle, which hold the children in the wombs safely enclosed apart so that they do not miscarry. 2. And I desire to approach toward the Fravashi <a name="fr_1162"></a><a href="#fn_1153"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Ahura Mazda, and with my praise, and for those of the Bountiful Immortals, with all the holy Fravashis which are those of the heavenly Yazads. And I desire to approach the Fravashi of Gaya Maretan (the life-man) in my worship with my praise, and for that of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra Spitâma, and for those of Kavi Vî<i>s</i>tâspa, and of Isa<i>t</i>-vâstra <a name="fr_1163"></a><a href="#fn_1154"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Zarathu<i>s</i>trian, with all the holy Fravashis of the other ancient counsellors as well. 3. And I desire in my worship to approach toward every holy Fravashi whosesoever it may be, and wheresoever dead upon this earth (its possessor may have lain), the pious woman, or the girl of tender years, the maiden diligent (among the cattle) in the field (who) may have dwelt (here; yea, all) which are now worshipped from this house <a name="fr_1164"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which are attentive to, and which attain to (our) good Yasnas and (our) homage. 4. Yea, I desire to approach the Fravashis of the saints with my praise, redoubted (as they are) and overwhelming, the Fravashis of those who held to the ancient lore, and the Fravashis of the next-of-kin; and I desire to approach toward the Fravashi of mine own <a name="fr_1165"></a><a href="#fn_1156"><font size="1">4</font></a> soul in my worship with my praise; and I desire therewith to approach toward all the lords of the ritual, and with</p>
