 <p><font size="-1">I (1-6). The five places where the Earth feels most joy.</font></p>  
 <p>II (7-11). The five places where the Earth feels most sorrow.</p>  
 <p>III (12-35). The five things which most rejoice the Earth.</p>  
 <p>IV (36-42). Corpses ought not to be buried in the Earth.</p>  
 <p>There is a resemblance as to words between the first and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">second parts, but there is none as to matter; no clause in the former has its counterpart in the latter. There is more resemblance between the second part and the third; as the first three clauses of the third part (§§ 12, 13, 22) relate to the same things as the second, third, and fourth clauses of the second part (§§ 8, 9, 10).</font></p>  
 <p>Parts I and II are nothing more than dry enumerations. Part III is more interesting, as it contains two long digressions, the one (§§ 14-21) on funeral laws, the other (§§ 24-33) on the holiness of husbandry. The fourth part of the chapter may he considered as a digression relating to the first clause of the third part (§ 12).</p>  
 <p>The things which rejoice or grieve the Earth are those that produce fertility and life or sterility and death, either in it or on it.</p>  
 <p>The subject of this chapter has become a commonplace topic with the Parsis, who have treated it more or less antithetically in the Mainyô-i-khard (chaps. V and VI) and in the Ravaets (Gr. Rav. pp. 434-437).</p>  
 <p>The second digression (§§ 24-33) is translated in Haug's Essays, p. 235 seq.</p>  <h3 align="center">I.</h3>

 <p>14 (44). Let no man alone by himself carry a corpse <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

 <p>17 (5 7). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thirty paces from the fire, thirty paces from the water, thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma, three paces from the faithful.</p>  
 <p>18, 19 (58-63). ‘There, on that place, shall the Worshippers of Mazda erect an enclosure <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and therein shall they establish him with food, therein shall they establish him with clothes, with the coarsest food and with the most worn-out clothes.

 <p>26, 27 (87-90). ‘He who would till the earth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! with the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, unto him thus says the Earth: "O thou man! who dost till me with the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left hither shall people ever come and beg (for bread <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">1</font></a>), here shall I ever go on bearing, bringing forth all manner of food, bringing forth profusion of corn <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</p>

 <p>32 (105). ‘When barley is coming forth, the Daêvas start up <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">2</font></a>; when the corn is growing rank <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">3</font></a>, then faint the Daêvas hearts; when the corn is being ground <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the Daêvas groan; when wheat is coming forth, the Daêvas are destroyed.

 <p>40 (137). When is it so?</p>  
 <p>‘It is so, if the sinner be a professor of the law of Mazda, or one who has been taught in it <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

They were formerly twigs of the pomegranate, date, or tamarind tree, or of any tree that had no thorns, and were plucked with particular ceremonies, which alone made them fit to be used for liturgic purposes (cf. Farg. XIX, 18 seq.) The Parsis in India found it convenient to replace them by brass wires, which, when once consecrated, can be used for an indefinite period. It is the baresma which is alluded to by Strabo, when speaking of the bundle of thin twigs of heath, which the Magi hold in their hand <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a> while reciting their hymns (τὰς δὴ ἐπῳδὰς ποιοῦνται πολὺν χρόνον ῥάβδων μυρικίνων λεπτῶν δέσμην κατέχουτες, XV, 3, 14).</p>

XIX, 45), or, 'the back of Arezûra' (Bund. 21,17). Arezûra was first the name of a fiend who was killed by Gayômar<i>d</i> (Mainyô-i-khard XXVII, 15); and mount Arezûra was most likely the mountain to which he was bound, as A<i>z</i>i Dahâka was to Demâvend (see Introd.

Rav. 435, 437). Although the erection of Dakhmas is enjoined by the law, yet the Dakhma in itself is as unclean as any spot on the earth can be, since it is always in contact with the dead (cf. Farg. VII, 55). The impurity which would otherwise be scattered over the whole world, is thus brought together to one and the same spot. Yet even that spot, in spite of the Ravaet, is not to lie defiled for ever, as every fifty years the Dakhmas ought to be pulled down, so that their sites may be restored to their natural purity (V. i. Farg. VII, 49 seq. and this Farg. § 13).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_441"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_444">25:3</a> There is no counterpart given to the first grief (§ 7), because, as the Commentary naively expresses it, 'it is not possible so to dig out hell, which will be done at the end of the world' (Bund. XXXI, sub fin.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_442"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_445">26:1</a> No ceremony in general can be performed by one man alone. Two Mobeds are wanted to perform the Vendîdâd service, two priests for the Barashnûm, two persons for the Sag-dîd (Anquetil, II, 584 n.) It is never good that the faithful should be alone, as the fiend is always lurking about, ready to take advantage of any moment of inattention. If the faithful be alone, there is no one to make up for any negligence and to prevent mischief arising from it. Never is the danger greater than in the present case, when the fiend is close at hand, and in direct contact with the faithful.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_444"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_447">26:3</a> As the Nasu has taken hold of him, he has become a Nasu incarnate, and must no longer be allowed to come into contact with men, whom he would defile.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_445"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_448">27:1</a> The Arme<i>s</i>t-gâh, the place for the unclean; see Introd. V, 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_446"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_449">27:2</a> Hana means, literally, 'an old man;' Zaurura, 'a man broken down by age;' Pairi<i>s</i>ta-khshudra, 'one whose seed is dried up.' These words seem to have acquired the technical meanings of 'fifty, sixty, and seventy years old.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_449"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_452">28:1</a> The performance of the Patet. See Introd. V, 22.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_450"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_453">28:2</a> It seems as if the law had formerly directed that he should be immediately put to death; but that afterwards, when the rigour of the law had abated, the object which had previously been fulfilled by his death, was then attained by his confinement. He was allowed to live in confinement till he was old and all but dead, and he was put to death by the law, just before he would have died in the usual course of nature (see §§ 19, 20). Certain Ravaets put the 'carrier alone' among the number of the margarzân (East India Office Library, Zend MSS. VIII, 144); he is not only to be punished in this world, but in the other too; he is condemned to feed in hell on corpses of men (Ar<i>d</i>â Vîrâf XXXVIII).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_456"></a><a href="sbe0409.htm#fr_459">30:1</a> The translation 'acts of adoration' and 'oblations' is doubtful: the words in the text ἅπαξ λεγόμενα, which are traditionally translated 'feet' and 'breasts.' The Commentary has as follows: 'He makes the law of Mazda as fat as a child could be made by means of a hundred feet, that is to say, of fifty servants walking to rock him; of a thousand breasts, that is, of five hundred nurses; of ten thousand sacrifices performed for his weal.'</p>
