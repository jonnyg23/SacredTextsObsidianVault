 <p><a name="fn_825"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_837">152:1</a> The hedge-hog. As it struggles from midnight till the dawn, this supposes the existence of a myth, in which the rays of the sun, beginning from midnight to pierce the veil of darkness, were compared to the prickles of a heavenly hedge-hog.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_826"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_838">152:2</a> Du<i>z</i>aka is the popular name of the hedge-hog (Pers. <i>z</i>u<i>z</i>ah). The name Vanghâpara must have referred to its mythical qualities. It is not without importance which name is given to it: 'When called by its high name, it is powerful' (Comm.); cf. § 6, and Farg. XVIII, 15. The nature of every being lies partly in its name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_827"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_839">152:3</a> The bridge leading to paradise; see Farg. XIX, 30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_828"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_840">152:4</a> Cf. § 54. Aspendiârji translates: 'He cannot atone for it in his life even by performing a sacrifice to Sraosha.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_842">153:2</a> 'When not so called it is less strong' (Comm.) Zairimyâka is a lucky name, as it is connected with a word (zairimya) which denotes the freshness of water and verdure; and it seems to designate the tortoise as 'the fresh-water creature' (Asp.); therefore the name is corrected into 'the injurer (?) of fresh water.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_837"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_849">155:1</a> A dog not older than four months.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_838"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_850">155:2</a> Unknown. Cf. V, 31, 32.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_840"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_852">155:4</a> A weazel. Cf. V, 33.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_841"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_853">155:5</a> A fox. The fox belongs to the good creation, as he fights against the demon Khava (Bund. XIX; cf. Orm. Ahr. § 228).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_842"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_854">155:6</a> The beaver. 'For the penalty in that case is most heavy' (Comm.) Cf. § 52 seq. and Farg. XIV.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_843"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_855">156:1</a> A measure unknown; it seems to have been the average distance of fourteen houses (see the gloss ad § 17 in the Introd. V, 4, Farg. XV, 45, and Bund. p. 31, 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_844"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_856">156:2</a> 'He cannot do the same as the shepherd's dog and the house dog do, but he catches Khrafstras and smites the Nasu' (Comm.) It is 'the dog without a master' (gharîb), the vagrant dog; he is held in great esteem (§ 22) and is one of the dogs who can be used for the Sag-dîd (Introd. V, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_845"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_857">156:3</a> Invited as a guest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_846"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_858">157:1</a> The Vohunazga dog has no domicile, therefore he is not compared with the master of a house; as he smites the Nasu, he is like a holy man, of the wandering class, a sort of begging friar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_847"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_859">157:2</a> Probably, 'Who has performed the nû-zûd, fifteen years old.' The young dog enters the community of the faithful at the age of four months, when he can smite the Nasu.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_848"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_860">157:3</a> 'I also saw the soul of a man, whom demons, just like dogs, ever tear. That man gives bread to the dogs, and they eat it not; <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a> but they ever devour the breast, legs, belly, and thighs of the man. And I asked thus: What sin was committed by this body, whose soul suffers so severe a punishment? Srôsh the pious and Âtarô the angel said thus: This is the soul of that wicked man who, in the world, kept back the food of the dogs of shepherds and householders; or beat and killed them' (Ardai Vîrâf XLVIII, translated by Haug).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_849"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_861">158:1</a> 'Whenever one eats bread one must put aside three mouthfuls and give them to the dog . . . for among all the poor there is none poorer than the dog' (Saddar V; Hyde 35).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_850"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_862">159:1</a> A measure of unknown amount. Aspendiârji reads i<i>s</i>ti, 'a brick' thick.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_851"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_863">159:2</a> By the forepart and the back part of it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_852"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_864">159:3</a> As there is no essential difference between man and beast, the beast must answer for its guilt. According to Solon's law, the dog who has bitten any one must be delivered to him tied up to a block four cubits long (Plutarchus, Solon 24); the horse who has killed a man is put to death (Eusebius, Prep. Evang. 5).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_853"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_865">159:4</a> 'They only cut off a piece of flesh from the foot' (Brouillons d‘Anquetil).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_865"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_877">163:5</a> 'But for the dog not a single head of cattle would remain in existence' (Saddar 31; Hyde 35).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_866"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_878">164:1</a> Marrow is the seat of life, the spine is 'the column and the spring of life' (Yt. X, 7 1); the sperm comes from it (Bundahi<i>s</i> XVI). The same theory prevailed in India, where the sperm is called ma<i>g</i><i>g</i>â-samudbhava, 'what is born from marrow;' it was followed by Plato (Timaeus 74, 91; cf. Plut. De Plac. Philos. V, 3, 4), and disproved by Aristotle (De Part. Anim. III, 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_879">164:2</a> To the spring of Ardvî Sûra, the goddess of waters.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_880">164:3</a> There is therefore in a single water dog as much life and holiness as in a thousand dogs. This accounts for the following.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_869"></a><a href="sbe0419.htm#fr_881">165:1</a> The zanda ravân, the same sacrifice as is offered up for three days and three nights after the death of a man for the salvation of his soul. Cf. <a href="sbe0415.htm#page_132">p. 132</a>, n. <a href="sbe0415.htm#fn_775">4</a>.</p>
