 <p><font size="-1">THIS chapter is an enumeration of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, and of as many plagues created in opposition by Angra Mainyu.</font></p>  
 <p>Many attempts have been made, not only to identify these sixteen lands, but also to draw historical conclusions from their order of succession, as representing the actual order of the migrations and settlements of the old Iranian tribes <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But there is nothing in the text that would authorise us to look to it even for legendary records, much less for real history. We have here nothing more than a geographical description of Iran, such as might be expected in a religious work like the Vendîdâd, that is to say, one that contains mythical lands as well as real countries. It is not easy to decide with perfect certainty, in every case, whether we have to do with a land of the former or of the latter kind, owing partly to our deficient knowledge of the geography of ancient Iran, partly to the fact that names, originally belonging to mythical lands, are often in later times attached to real ones.</p>  
 <p>Of these sixteen lands there are certainly nine which have really existed, and of which we know the geographical position, as we are able to follow their names from the records of the Achæmenian kings or the works of classical writers down to the map of modern Iran. They are the following:--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <font size="-1">The real existence of Nisâya (5) is certain, although its position cannot be exactly determined (see the note to § 8).</font></p>  
 <p>For the other lands we are confined for information to the Pahlavi Commentary. <i>K</i>akhra (13) is only transliterated, whether the name was then too much known to require any further explanation or too little to allow of any. Urva (8) is described as being Masân ('the land of Masân' or 'the land of the Great'), a name which applied, in the Sassanian ages, to the land around Ispahân (Firdausi, ed. Mohl, V, 270).</p>  
 <p>For 'Varena, the four-cornered' (14), the Commentary hesitates between the Padashkhvârgar mountains (the Elborz) and Kirmân, a hesitation easily accounted for by the fact that Varena is the seat of the struggle between A<i>z</i>i<i>s</i> Dahâka and Thraêtaona, between the storm serpent and the storm god, and was formerly 'the four-sided Heaven' (see Introd. IV, 12, 23). Modern tradition decides in favour of Padashkhvârgar, probably because the serpent was at last bound to Demavand, the highest peak in that chain. The claims of Kirmân were probably founded on the popular etymology of its name, 'the land of snakes.'</p>  
 <p>'Vaêkereta, of the evil shadows' (8), is identified with Kapul (Cabul); whether rightly or wrongly, we are unable to decide; yet, as it is spoken of only as the seat of the adventures of Keresâspa (see Introd. IV, 21), it may be suspected that this assimilation rests merely on the fact that, in later tradition, the legend of Keresâspa was localised in the table-land of Peshyansâi, in Kabulistan (Bund. XXX).</p>  
 <p>In the enumeration there is no apparent order whatever, and Ormazd, in his creations, seems to travel all over the map, forward and backward, without the slightest regard to the cardinal points. Yet, the starting point and the final point have not been arbitrarily chosen: the first land created was 'the Airyana Vaê<i>g</i>ô by the Vanguhi Dâitya,' and the last was the land by the Rangha. Now,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">the Vanguhi and the Rangha were originally the celestial rivers that came down from heaven (as two heavenly Gaṅgâs) to surround the earth, the one in the east, the other in the west (Bund. XX); this is why the creation begins with a land by the Vanguhi and ends with a land by the Rangha.</font></p>  
 <p>In the Sassanian ages, when the Tigris was definitively the border of Iran in the west, the Rangha was identified with it, and the sixteenth land is accordingly described in the Commentary as being Arvastân-i-Rûm, or Roman Mesopotamia. But all the Avesta passages in which the Rangha is cited refer to its mythical nature, as the river in the far-off horizon, as the surrounding Okeanos, and, now and then, still resembling its Vedic homonym, the Rasâ, as the river that divides the gods from the fiends.</p>  
 <p>The first land, the Airyana Vaê<i>g</i>ô by the Vanguhi Dâitya, remained to the last a mythical region. It was originally the abode of Yima and of the righteous, that is to say, a particular form of paradise (see Introd. IV, 38, and Farg. II). Later on, it was looked for in the countries north of Adarbaijan, probably in order that it should be as near as possible to the seat of the Zoroastrian religion, yet without losing its supernatural character by the counter-evidence of facts. This brought about the division of the Vanguhi Dâitya into two rivers: as the Airyana Vaê<i>g</i>ô was localised in the country north of Adarbaijan, the river in it must become identified with the Araxes (Aras); but, at the same time, it continued to surround the world eastward under the name of Veh (Vanguhi), which was the Sassanian name of the Oxus--Indus <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a>. It seems that in the time of Herodotus, the Araxes and the Oxus were considered one and the same river <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as the Oxus and the Indus were later on; this would account for his strange statement that the Araxes, which is confessedly with him the Oxus or Yaxartes, springs from the land of the Matianians, like the Gyndes, and flows eastwards (I, 202; IV, 40; cf. III, 36; IV, 11); and, at the same time, this would account both for how the Airyana Vaê<i>g</i>ô could be localised in the basin of the Araxes and how the Oxus could flow eastwards to fall into the Arabian sea <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">It follows hence that no historical conclusions can be drawn from this description: it was necessary that it should begin with the Vanguhi and end with the Rangha. To look to it for an account of geographical migrations, is converting cosmology into history.</font></p>  
 <p>Of the counter-creations of Angra Mainyu there is little to be said: they are different vices and plagues, which are generally unconnected with the country to the creation of which they answer. Some of them are expressed by ἅπαξ λεγόμενα, the meaning of which is doubtful or unknown.</p>  
 <p>If we assume that only lands belonging to the Iranian world were admitted into the list, the mention of the Seven Rivers would indicate that the first Fargard was not composed earlier than the time when the basin of the Indus became a part of Iran, that is, not earlier than the reign of Darius the First.</p>  
 <p>1. Ahura Mazda <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">1</font></a> spake unto Spitama <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">2</font></a> Zarathu<i>s</i>tra <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">3</font></a>, saying:</p>

 <p>Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created by his witchcraft the serpent in the river <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">3</font></a> and winter, a work of the Daêvas <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created by his witchcraft the Pairika Knãthaiti, who clave unto Keresâspa <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

Clause 2 belongs to the Commentary; it is composed of quotations that illustrate the alternative process of the creation: 'First, Ahura Mazda would create a land of such kind that its dwellers might like it, and there could be nothing more delightful. Then he who is all death would bring against it a counter-creation.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_359"></a><a href="sbe0407.htm#fr_361">5:2</a> 'The good Dâitya.' 'The Dâitîk (Dâitya) comes from Irân Vê<i>g</i> (Airyana Vaê<i>g</i>ô), it flows through the mountains of Gor<i>g</i>istân (Georgia,' Bund. p. 51, 19). It was therefore, in the time of the Sassanides, a name of the Araxes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_360"></a><a href="sbe0407.htm#fr_362">5:3</a> 'There are many Khrafstras in the Dâitîk, as it is said, The Dâitîk full of Khrafstras' (Bund. p. 51, 20). The serpent in the river was originally the mythical Serpent, A<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>, who overthrew and killed the king of Irân Vê<i>g</i>, Yima (see Introd. IV, 18); then it was identified, as appears from the Bundahi<i>s</i>, with the snakes that abound on the banks of the Araxes (Morier, A Second Journey, p. 250).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_361"></a><a href="sbe0407.htm#fr_363">5:4</a> As Irân Vê<i>g</i> is a place of refuge for mankind and all life from the winter that is to destroy the world (see Farg.

 <p><a name="fn_399"></a><a href="sbe0407.htm#fr_401">9:8</a> It is interpreted in a figurative sense as meaning 'people who <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a> do not hold the chief for a chief' (Comm.), which is the translation for asraosha (Comm. ad XVI, 18), 'rebel against the law,' and would well apply in the Sassanian ages to the non-Mazdean people of Arvastân-i-Rûm. I think we must adopt the literal meaning, and recognise in this passage the source, or at least the oldest form, of those tales about people without a head, with eyes on their shoulders, which Pliny received from the half-Persian Ctesias (Hist. N. VII, 2; V, 8; cf. Aul. Gell. IX, 4; Sanct. August. De Civit. Dei, XVI, 8). Persian geographers mention such people, they place them in the Oriental islands near China, whence they sent ambassadors to the Khan of the Tatars (Ouseley, Catalogue). The mythical origin of those tales may be traced in Indian and Greek mythology (Orm. Ahr. § 222; cf. Pausanias IX, 20).</p>
