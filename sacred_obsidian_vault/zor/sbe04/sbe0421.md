 <p>1. How many are the sins that men commit and that, being committed and not confessed, nor atoned for, make their committer a Peshôtanu <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">2</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘There are five such sins, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! It is the first of these sins that men commit when a man teaches one of the faithful a foreign, wrong creed <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">3</font></a>, a foreign wrong law, and he does so with a full knowledge and conscience of the sin: this is a sin that makes him a Peshôtanu.</p>

 <p>4 (11). ‘If the bones stick in the dog's teeth or stop in his throat, or if the hot food burn his mouth or his tongue, so that mischief follows therefrom, and the dog dies, this is a sin that makes the man a Peshôtanu <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5 (16). ‘It is the third of these sins that men commit when a man smites a bitch big with young or affrights her by running after her, with shouting or with clapping of hands <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">2</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>6 (18). ‘If the bitch fall into a hole, or a well, or a precipice, or a river, or a canal, so that mischief follows therefrom, and she dies, this is a sin that makes the man a Peshôtanu <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7 (22). ‘It is the fourth of these sins that men commit when a man has intercourse with a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period: this is a sin that makes him a Peshôtanu <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>10 (34). ‘And if the damsel, from dread of the people, shall produce in herself the menses against the course of nature, by means of water and plants, there is a sin upon her head <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>18 (56). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It a man come near unto a damsel, either dependent on the chief of the family or not dependent, either delivered unto a husband or not delivered, and she conceives by him, so long shall he support her, until the child is born <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>
