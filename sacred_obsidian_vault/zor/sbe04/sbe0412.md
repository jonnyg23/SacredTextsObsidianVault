 <p>34 (73). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘As long as the corpse has not been taken out of the water <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">1</font></a>, so long shall that water be unclean and unfit to drink.

 <p>37 (75). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Three steps on each of the four sides. As long as the corpse has not been taken out of the water, so long shall that water be unclean and unfit to drink. They shall, therefore, take the corpse out of the water, and lay it down on the dry ground.</p>

 <p>does the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu defile with infection pollution, and uncleanness?</p>  
 <p>40 (80). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Three steps down the stream, nine steps up the stream, six steps across. As long as the corpse has not been taken out of the water, so long shall the water be unclean and unfit to drink. They shall, therefore, take the corpse out of the water, and lay it down on the dry ground.</p>  
 <p>41 (83). 'After the corpse has been taken out and the stream has flowed three times <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the water is clean, and both cattle and men may drink of it at their pleasure, as before.'</p>  <h3 align="center">IV.</h3>  
 <p>42 (84). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the Haoma that has been touched by the corpse of a dead dog, or the corpse of a dead man, be made clean again?</p>  
 <p>40 (85). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! If it has been strained for the Sacrifice, no corpse that has been brought unto it, makes corruption or death enter it <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">2</font></a>. If it has not been strained for the sacrifice, the stem is defiled the length of four fingers. That length of stem shall be buried in the ground, in the middle of the house, for a year long.

 <p>46 (95). ‘There shall the worshippers of Mazda fasten the corpse, by the feet and by the hair, with brass, stones, or lead, lest the corpse-eating dogs and the corpse-eating birds shall go and carry the bones to the water and to the trees.</p>  
 <p>47 (98). 'If they shall not fasten the corpse, so that the corpse-eating dogs and the corpse-eating birds may go and carry the bones to the water and to the trees, what is the penalty that they shall pay?'</p>  
 <p>48 (100). Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall be Peshôtanus: two hundred stripes with the Aspahê-a<i>s</i>tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-<i>k</i>arana.'</p>
