 <p>1. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be in the house of a worshipper of Mazda a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_950"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_962">182:2</a> Earthen vessels, when defiled, cannot be made clean; but metal vessels can (see Farg. VII, 73 seq.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_951"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_963">182:3</a> A danare is, according to Anquetil, as much as four tolas, a tola is from 105 to 175 grains.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_952"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_964">182:4</a> 'Sôshyôs says: For three nights cooked meat is not allowed to her, lest the issue shall grow stronger.' As the fiend is in her, any strength she may gain accrues to Ahriman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_953"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_965">182:5</a> A child whom she suckles. The meaning is, Even a child, if he has touched her, must undergo the rites of cleansing. The general rule is given in the Commentary: 'Whoever has touched a Dashtân woman must wash his body and his clothes with gômêz and water.' The ceremony in question is the simple Ghosel, not the Barashnûm, since the woman herself performs the former only (vide infra, § 11 seq.; cf. Introd. V, 16).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_954"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_966">183:1</a> See Introd. V, 12.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_957"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_969">185:1</a> A disease (Farg. VII, 58). There is another word naêza, 'a spear,' so that one may translate also 'killed by the spear' (Asp.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_958"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_970">185:2</a> 'Not that the two deeds are equal, but neither is good' (Comm.) The sin in question is a simple tanâfûhr (Farg. XV, 7), and therefore can be atoned for by punishment and repentance, whereas the burning of a corpse is a crime for which there is no atonement (Farg. I, 17; VIII, 73 seq.; Introd. V, 8).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_959"></a><a href="sbe0422.htm#fr_971">185:3</a> Literally, 'is a Peshôtanu;' 'he is a tanâfûhr sinner, that is to say, margarzân (worthy of death),' Comm.</p>
