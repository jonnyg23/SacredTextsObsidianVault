 <p>1. Of the three divisions of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">3</font></a>, as it exists in its 133 sections, the first is <i>of</i> thirteen <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">4</font></a> sections, <i>and contains</i> particulars about the nature of the recital of the Ahunavair <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">5</font></a>, which is the spiritual benefit from chanting it aloud, and whatever is on the same subject <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 2.

 <p>keeping a spiritual and worldly high-priest, performing every duty as to the high-priest, and maintaining even those of various high-priests.</p>  
 <p>3. About the twenty-one chieftainships, spiritually through Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and materially through Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through which the ceremonial of the sacred beings <i>and</i> the government of the members of the community (dâhmânŏ râyînî<i>d</i>ârîh) exist. 4. About the duties in the five periods <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the day and night, each separately, and the bridge<i>-judgment</i> of him who shouts out <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the ceremony of a season-festival <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <i>likewise of</i> him who does not provide the preparations for the feast of a season-festival, and who also becomes worried (sû<i>d</i>akŏ) in other ceremonials of the sacred beings.</p>  
 <p>5. About how to consider <i>and</i> what to do with a sacerdotal leader <i>and</i> a man <i>of</i> the superior classes (pî<i>s</i>akîkânŏ), him who atones for unimportant sin, and him who does not atone even for <i>that which is</i> important; <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject. 6. About the means through which membership of the community (dâhmîh) is prepared. 7. About the manifestation of virtuous manhood, and the merit and advantage from well uttering the words <i>of blessing</i> at eating <i>and</i> drinking food <i>and</i> drink, and <i>from</i> despising the inward talk of the demons.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 8. About the recitations at the five periods <i>of the day</i>, the ceremonial invocation by name of many angels in each separately, <i>and</i> great information on the same subject.</p>  
 <p>9. The worthiness <i>of</i> a man restrained (vandak) by authority, the devotion of life and body to the sacred beings, the good rulers, and their examination and satisfaction; <i>also</i> the blessing and winning words which are most successful in carrying off the affliction that is owing to the fiend. 10. About all-pleasing creativeness and omniscience, every precedence <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">1</font></a>, leadership, foresight <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">2</font></a>, worthy liberality, perspicacity (vênâkîh), and all proper cause <i>and</i> effect of righteousness; the individuality (khû<i>d</i>îh) of righteousness, the opposition to the demons of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s law, and also much other information in the same section.</p>  
 <p>11. The middle <i>division</i> is <i>of</i> 102 sections <i>containing</i> particulars about spiritual and worldly diligence, the leadership <i>of</i> the diligent and their mighty means, all the former deeds of righteousness. 12. Righteousness kindling the resolution is the reward of merit, each for each, and is provided by it for that which <i>one</i> mentions thus:'<i>It is</i> the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht which is the maintenance of righteousness, so that it may make righteousness more abiding in the body of a man.'</p>  
 <p>13. The last <i>division</i> is <i>of</i> nineteen sections <i>containing</i> a trusty remedy, that is, a remedy whose utterance aloud by the faithful is a chief resource (<i>a</i>fzârtûm) for the creatures of the sacred beings.</p>

Also the nature of sayings full of humility (pûrpâstîh), well-favoured, most select, <i>and</i> adapted <i>for</i> that which <i>one</i> mentions thus:'I reverence that chief, the beneficent <i>and</i> eminent Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, out of which is the sustainment of the strength of every word of Zaratû<i>s</i>t they trust in.'</p>  
 <p>15. It is perfect excellence <i>that</i> is righteousness.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_468"></a><a href="sbe37048.htm#fr_471">166:3</a> Corresponding to the twentieth word, dada<i>d</i>, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the twenty-first, and last, Nask in other Rivâyats. Its name occurs in the Avesta, in the form hadhaokhta, and it is called Hâdukht in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained thirty kardah, or fargar<i>d</i>s, which differs considerably from the number stated in this chapter. Yts. XXI, XXII are traditionally supposed to belong to the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, but there is hardly a trace of either of them in this chapter. Yt. XI is also distinguished by the same title.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_469"></a><a href="sbe37048.htm#fr_472">166:4</a> As the total of the 13 + 102 + 19 sections (mentioned in §§ 1, 11, 13) is 134, instead of 133, there must be an error in one of the four numbers given in the MS. This clerical error can hardly have been made in writing 19, and is unlikely in 102; but 133 may possibly stand for an original 134, though the writing of 13 instead of 12 is more probable. The Rivâyats give no assistance in settling this question, as they all divide this Nask into 30 kardah. On the whole, it will be safest to read 'twelve,' instead of 'thirteen,' until some better authority becomes available.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_470"></a><a href="sbe37048.htm#fr_473">166:5</a> Compare Yt. XI, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_471"></a><a href="sbe37048.htm#fr_474">166:6</a> It is just possible that this may refer to Yt. XXI which, though specially alluding to the recitation of the Ashem-vohû, or praise of <a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a> righteousness, also mentions that of the Ahunavair in its § 4. With regard, however, to Yt. XXII, there seems no possibility of identifying its text with any portion of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask as described in this chapter.</p>
