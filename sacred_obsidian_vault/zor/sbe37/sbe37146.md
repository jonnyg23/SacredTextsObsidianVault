 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 1, 2, refer to passages, one of which may possibly have contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. XII, 2:'It says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm that no one of them, that is an inattentive man who has no high-priest, attains to the best existence, not though his recitation should be so much that it has made his duty <i>and</i> good works as much as the verdure of the plants when it shoots forth in spring, the verdure which is given abundantly by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 3, refers to a passage which is thus quoted in Sls. X, 25:'When an action or an opinion comes forward, and <i>one</i> does not know whether <i>it be</i> a sin or a good work, when possible <i>it</i> is to be abandoned <i>and</i> not carried out by him, as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm that Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>has</i> not provided about anything whatever as regards everything, but three times <i>it has been done</i> by Zaratû<i>s</i>t about this duty, that is, so that the Avesta</p>

 <p><i>and</i> Zand, when made quite easy by <i>any</i> one, are for recitation, but are not to be mumbled, for, in mumbling, the portions <i>of</i> the Ahunavair are more chattering.'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 6, refers to the passage thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 12:'Where a child is born, <i>during</i> three days, for protection from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at night until day<i>light</i>, and is to be maintained there by day, and pure incense is to be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth <a name="fr_1828"></a><a href="#fn_1778"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm.'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chaps. XXXVIII, 13, XLI, 19, refer to passages which seem both to be partially quoted in Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 4-10, thus:'The period is eagerly proclaimed in another place, as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm thus:"Thripithwô zi asti âtar<i>s</i> Ahurahê Mazd<i>a</i>u hama, bipithwô aiwi-gâmê, atha narô ashavanô:For thrice-supplied is the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>in</i> summer <a name="fr_1829"></a><a href="#fn_1779"><font size="1">2</font></a>, twice in winter; so is the righteous man. (Whoever has become a depriver of food (atapdâ<i>d</i>) four <i>times</i>, which are successive, should be in doubtfulness as to unrestricted (aband) maintenance vî<i>k</i>ithrem<i>k</i>i<i>d</i>: without any publicity; as much as <i>it is</i> possible to see <i>being</i> the original minimum of any other)."'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXV III, 33, refers to the passage which contained the statements thus quoted in Ep. I, viii, 1, 7:'<i>It is</i> declared in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm, that the consecrated bull's urine, when it becomes</p>

 <p>fetid, is to be stirred up <a name="fr_1830"></a><a href="#fn_1780"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> they should not carry <i>it</i> forth so to the fire, so that the stench extends to the fire; because, if that stench extends to the fire, on account of the moisture <i>and</i> through carrying bodily refuse over and forth to the fire, it overwhelms it. And that which the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm <i>has</i> declared is, specially, that one of the high-priests <i>has</i> individually said: "That stench is mentioned with reference to the <i>occasion</i> when a stench reaches it of a different kind <i>from that</i> which exists naturally in it."'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLIII, 33, refers to the passage which contained the statements thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 10, XIII, 30:'In the twenty-two <a name="fr_1831"></a><a href="#fn_1781"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>sections</i> of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm grievous things are shown about those who do not make offerings unto the sacred beings.' And, again, 'while those nineteen (<i>stanzas of Yas. XLVI</i>) are our offering, which it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm should be my own, the strength and power of the sacred beings shall become more considerable, and the destroyer more perishable.'</p>
