 <p>1. The tenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yâ-<i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothanâ <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is about the complaint of the spirit of fires to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> owing to seven descriptions of people. 2. First, owing to domestics considering <i>it</i> as contemptible and <i>in</i> an unresisting state (a<i>g</i>angîh), molesting <i>it</i> immoderately, and making use of it with unwashed hands; also the damsel who <i>has</i> introduced fire into the sole of <i>her</i> foot, and the bursting of the blister (âvilag); and a weapon brought out into <i>its</i> splendour. Second, the complaint owing to the carriers of fire from that abode [where the provision of care for fire is as a law to them, to that abode] <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">2</font></a> where the provision of care for fire is not as a law to them. 4. And there, owing to the arrival and preparation of the demons, it lay stupefied, like a powerful youth <i>who is</i> feverish and in a languid state; and its cure from that sickness (ayôyakîh) was by bringing forward to it their pure sandalwood, or benzoin, or aloe-wood, or pomegranate <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>whatever <i>there</i> was of the most odoriferous of plants. 5. Third, the complaint owing to the hussy <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">1</font></a> unto whom it happens, through menstruation, <i>that</i> the stench and filth owing to the menstruation is brought to it (<i>the fire</i>); and <i>its</i> sickness and stupefaction owing thereto are as written above. 6. Fourth, the complaint owing to the hussy who, dropping <i>her</i> knee on to the fire-stand, arranged <i>her</i> curls; the falling of damp and moisture from <i>her</i> head, with the hair and filth therefrom, into the fire; the consumption <i>of it</i> discontentedly, <i>and</i> the sickness and stupefaction owing thereto. 7. Fifth, the complaint owing to the father, <i>or</i> guardian, of a child for not keeping the child away from the fire; and the bodily refuse and other unlawfulness that come upon it from such children. 8. Sixth, the complaint owing to the adversity which the unpurified infidel (agdênô) may bring upon it, by blowing the breath of <i>his</i> mouth upon it in directing <i>its</i> use, <i>and</i> it becomes incalculable. 9. Seventh, the complaintwhich, <i>one</i> says, is more awful and more grievousowing to those who use it as an ordeal for a falsehood, and, when it is made evident thereby as to the acquitted and convicted, they become of a different opinion about it.</p>  
 <p>10. At the place of complaint that which is polluted is put forward together with that which is pure, and the increase of it (<i>the fire</i>) is through lawful and unlawful operation; <i>its</i> burning alone</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>and increasing are such as when both would be as a necessity for it, and undesired and rapid burning and increasing <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">1</font></a> are those which are polluted by burning <i>and</i> insatiably consuming; and in that which is an operation unlawfullythe burning alone <i>and</i> increasing <i>being</i> [such as when] <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">2</font></a> both would be as a necessity [for it]the increase is troubled.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, he <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">3</font></a> says: 'I am not <i>of the world</i> here, and from here I <i>will</i> extricate <i>myself</i>, from the earth up to the sky; I am also thy son <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">4</font></a>, more to thee <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">5</font></a> than any of the other creatures.' 12. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to him thus: 'So thou shouldst stand over the fire, in thy proper duty as [a spirit <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">6</font></a>], carrying that club; [it is a substantial means, because I produce it, through which] thou turnest off [the whole bodily existence], some to the endless light, and some to the endless darkness.'</p>  
 <p>13. This, too, that <i>he</i> who shall provide care for, fire has paid the greatest reverence unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 14. The propitiation of the righteous is the best <i>thing</i>, and their vexation is the worst; when pleased they favour one, <i>and it is</i> the law of the sacred beings that they promote; [when vexed they wound, <i>and it</i> is the demon that they restrict.</p>  
 <p>15. It is righteousness <i>that is</i> perfect excellence.] <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_551">186:2</a> The words in brackets are omitted in B by mistake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_552">186:3</a> The traditional equivalents of the four sweet-scented vegetable substances, Av. urvâsna, vohû-gaona, vohû-kereti, and hadhâ-naêpata, which are mentioned in Vend. VIII, 2, 79, IX, 32, XIV, 3, <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a> XVIII, 71 as acceptable fuel for the sacred fire, or scent for fumigation; their Pahlavi names are merely corruptions of these Avesta words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_553">187:1</a> The word <i>g</i>êh, 'courtezan,' is used here and in § 6 merely as a general opprobrious term for a woman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_554">188:1</a> As in the case of a destructive conflagration.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_555">188:2</a> The words in brackets are supplied by guess, to fill up a blank space left by the repairer of B on one of his patches. In K the passage is shorter, and stands as follows:'and in that which is unlawful operation <i>it is</i> troubled by the increase.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe37060.htm#fr_556">188:3</a> The spirit of fires mentioned in § 1. This dialogue seems to be a quotation from the original Pahlavi version of the Nask.</p>
