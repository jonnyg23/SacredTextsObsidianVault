 <p>worship is good thinking. 2. This, too, that Vohûman and the liturgy are lodging in the body of him in whose body the religion is lodging; <i>and so is</i> the spirit of goodness, which is peace (pa<i>d</i>mân). 3. This, too, that the good religion is taught in word and deed by him who shall achieve the giving of thought (mîni<i>s</i>n-dahîh) <i>to</i> Vohûman <i>in</i> the ceremonial. 4. This, too, that the archangels become lodging in the body of him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because their lodging is in light, purity, and perfume, and the body is illuminated, purified, and perfumed by Vohûman.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in the performance of good works by him who shall provide gifts for the doers of good works. 6. This, too, that by him who loves the beneficial way <a name="fr_1517"></a><a href="#fn_1478"><font size="1">1</font></a>, even others are put <i>in</i> the same way <i>and</i> taught. 7. This, too, that he gives his daughter in daughterhood to <i>his</i> fatherhood <a name="fr_1518"></a><a href="#fn_1479"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who teaches to the daughter reverence towards <i>her</i> father; even for this reason, because she is made steadfast in daughterhood by him. 8. This, too, that the authority of Vohûman is taught by him who keeps the talent which is his for virtue; even for this reason, because from the authority of goodness arise the advantage <i>and</i> freedom from strife of the sciences (hûnarânŏ).</p>  
 <p>9. This, too, that a daughter is given to a father for womanly service (nê<i>s</i>manîh <a name="fr_1519"></a><a href="#fn_1479"><font size="1">2</font></a>), <i>and</i> so also a wife to another man, by him who teaches reverence, towards father and husband, to the daughter and the other woman; and so, too, <i>by him</i> who instructs</p>

 <p>the wife of a man in housewifery; because the advantageous womanly service of a woman <i>for</i> a man arises through reverence towards <i>her</i> husband and good training in housewifery. 10. This, too, that even the reverence <i>of</i> a wife towards a husband is produced by him <i>who</i> gives a woman unto a man; because the giver of possession (khû<i>d</i>îh) becomes praiseworthy even by the act of <i>having</i> given that possession.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, that origin and effect (bûn va-bar) are produced for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who gives <i>what</i> is necessary unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and teaches perpetual preservation; <i>what</i> is properly necessary <i>being</i> the origin of the preservation <i>which is</i> the effect of <i>what</i> is properly necessary. 12. This, too, that dominion is acquired for the house of him who keeps the door of the house an opening for the wise; the house <i>being</i> the body, <i>and</i> the door of the house <i>being</i> the ear, eye, and mouth.</p>  
 <p>13. It is the excellence <i>of</i> righteousness <i>that is</i> perfect.</p>
