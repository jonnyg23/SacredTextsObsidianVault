 <p>1. The fourteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>-fravakhshyâ <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1402"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is <i>that</i> whatever is instruction is to be listened to <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1403"><font size="1">4</font></a> here as much as is possible, <i>and</i> he who is not to be</p>

 <p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>  
 <p>taught is allowed an opportunity <i>for</i> listening by Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>2. This, too, that by him who would be a causer of procreation for performers of labour, the perfect nature of the performance of the first next-of-kin marriage <a name="fr_1437"></a><a href="#fn_1404"><font size="1">1</font></a> is praised; because causing the procreation of performers of labour is the fatherhood of mankind, the proper fatherhood of mankind is through the proper production of progeny, the proper progeny of the producer is through the accomplishment of progeny among his own, according to the disposition of the first creatures, and the accomplishment of progeny among one's own is next-of-kin marriage; and that which <i>occurs</i>, when a causer of the procreation of performers of labour praises the fatherhood of mankind, <i>is that</i> next-of-kin marriage is also praised by him. 3. This, too, that by him whose creatures are in virtue, owing to his virtuous nourishment <i>of</i> the creatures, the performance of next-of-kin marriage <a name="fr_1438"></a><a href="#fn_1405"><font size="1">2</font></a> is taught, <i>and</i> the virtue is his virtue; even on this account, because, for the sake of keeping the creatures in virtue, he allows (and<i>â</i><i>z</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) for the virtuous disposition pertaining to the multitude, <i>and</i> that which is born he produces (dahê<i>d</i>ŏ) as lineage from the next-of-kin marriage pertaining to the multitude.</p>  
 <p>4. This, too, that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is in daughterhood <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1406"><font size="1">3</font></a> to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is taught by him whose wisdom is through complete mindfulness; even for this reason,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a></p>  
 <p>because <i>his</i> wisdom <i>and</i> complete mindfulness are within limits which are Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, the wisdom <i>being</i> that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the complete mindfulness that of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, and the complete mindfulness <i>being</i> the offspring of the wisdom just as Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and, owing to this, the assertion is reasonable that, by him whose complete mindfulness is connected with wisdom, it is taught <i>that</i> Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is in daughterhood to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. This, too, that thus the exercise of that daughterhood is taught by him whose righteousness is through complete mindfulness, and whose ceremonial is also through complete mindfulness; that is, he shall perform the ceremonial and other good works fully mindfully.</p>  
 <p>6. This, too, that mankind are attracted to religious good deeds by him who shall provide benefit for the people through actions <i>and</i> words; even for this reason, because those actions are religious good deeds, and, when instituted by him, <i>others</i> are also taught by him. 7. This, too, that reverence for Vohûman <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1407"><font size="1">1</font></a> is taught by him who shall make that which is contaminated obvious to the eye, so that what is dark <i>becomes</i> light; even for this reason, because the display of the work of Vohûman thereby has also taught the offer of reverence <i>for</i> Vohûman. 8. And this, too, that the ceremonial is taught with complete mindfulness <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1408"><font size="1">2</font></a> only <i>by him</i> who teaches words and actions with complete mindfulness.</p>  
 <p>9. Perfect righteousness is excellence.</p>
