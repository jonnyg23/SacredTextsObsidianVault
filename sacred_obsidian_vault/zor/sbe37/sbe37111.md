This, too, that the deeds of complete mindfulness are practised <a name="fr_1458"></a><a href="#fn_1425"><font size="1">4</font></a> and taught by him who becomes himself completely mindful. 3. This, too, that <i>whoever</i> shall openly perform good works becomes a nourisher of good works.</p>  
 <p>4. This, too, that the spirit of fatherhood becomes lodging in him who nourishes the creatures with propriety <a name="fr_1459"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 5.

 <p>7. This, too, that whoever shall justly inflict sentence and judgment, really according to the declaration regarding <i>one</i> acquitted <i>or</i> convicted <a name="fr_1462"></a><a href="#fn_1429"><font size="1">1</font></a>, becomes praiseworthy; even for this reason, because the origin of the judgment is the ritual of the ordeal. 8. And this, too, that by him who gives to him who is wise that which is needful for him, an immense <a name="fr_1463"></a><a href="#fn_1430"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>and</i> strong foundation for learning is produced, <i>and</i> the knowledge in the world is augmented.</p>
