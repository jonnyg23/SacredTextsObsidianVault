 <p><a name="fn_500"></a><a href="sbe37053.htm#fr_503">175:3</a> This third formula is chiefly recited at the end of most of the hâs in the Yasna, and consists of fifteen Avesta words, as follows:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>Yê<font size="-1">N</font>hê hâtãm âa<i>d</i>, yêsnê paitî, vanghô<br> mazd<i>a</i>u ahurô vaêthâ, ashâ<i>d</i> ha<i>k</i>â,<br> y<i>a</i>unghãm<i>k</i>â, tãs<i>k</i>â t<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>â yazamaidê.</dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> This may be translated as follows:'Of whatever male of the <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a> existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant, through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those males and those females we reverence.'</p>  
 <p>The Pahlavi version explains it as follows:'Whoever of those existing is thus in worship as regards a good <i>being</i> [that is, shall celebrate a ceremonial for that good <i>being</i> who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the lord], Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is aware of <i>it</i>, owing to the accompaniment of righteousness [<i>and being</i> acquainted with the reward and recompense of whatever are, severally, the duty and good works that any one has performed, he grants <i>them</i>]. I reverence those of the assembly, males and females [the archangels; because the male <i>of</i> them are good, and the female <i>of</i> them].'</p>  
 <p>The Pahlavi translator evidently read vanghô in the first line of the text, as printed above, and not in the second, as in the present MSS.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_501"></a><a href="sbe37053.htm#fr_504">176:1</a> So in K, but B has 'seventy.' The text seems to allude to the beginning of old age, of which three grades are mentioned in the Avesta (Vend. III, 19, 20): the hanô, zaururô, and pairi<i>s</i>tâkhshudrô. The Pahlavi version defines the age of each grade, but the ciphers given are corrupted in the MSS. extant. The Far. Oîm, p. 5, ll. 9, 10, gives fifty years as the age of the zarmân (Av. zaururô), seventy years as that of the hân (Av. hanô), and ninety years as that of the pâ<i>d</i>îrânŏ-shûsar (Av. pairi<i>s</i>tâkhshudrô); but whether this arrangement of the ages is compatible with the different order of these epithets in the Avesta is doubtful, though it shows that old age was considered to begin at the age of fifty years.</p>
