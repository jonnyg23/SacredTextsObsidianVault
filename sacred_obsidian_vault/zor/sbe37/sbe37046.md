About the accumulation (gan<i>g</i>îh) of sin through the expedients of the wrathful (garmakân), which are connected with much destruction of the righteous. 7.

 <p>15. About the production <i>and</i> arising of even that property which a liberal person <i>has</i> not seen, <i>if</i> there be any one who <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>has</i> not lived liberally.</p>

About a mother <i>being</i> guardian over a living father, owing to <i>their having</i> a son. 19.

About the sin of a father through not satisfying the menstrual excitement of a daughter who <i>has</i> attained the capability of <i>having</i> a son (be<i>r</i>man ra<i>d</i>îh); what it is when, through not satisfying the menstrual excitement of the daughter, <i>he is</i> sinful; and how it is when the daughter herself is sinful; also the symptoms of attaining the capability of <i>having</i> a son.</p>  
 <p>21. About where <i>and</i> which is that sin on the committal of which inadvertently <i>one</i> attains to deliverance thus, when it comes to his knowledge <i>it is</i> through a determined renunciation it goes away from <i>its</i> source; <i>also</i> which is that committal inadvertently which does not occur through him who is intelligent. 22. About the four more heinous <i>forms of</i> demon-service (<i>s</i>êdâ-y<i>a</i><i>z</i>akîh), and the three worst sins wherein they shall perform <i>them;</i> the ten existences that are furtherances, and the nine that are destroyers, <i>of</i> the world.</p>

About driving the bestowable benefit of the spiritual <i>existence</i> away from the world, when he who is destroying a righteous <i>man</i> walks openly in the world; how one section <i>of</i> the spirit's earth is that of a people <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">1</font></a> destroying the righteous <i>man</i>, and the complaint of the spirits of fire, water, and plants, owing thereto; <i>also</i> how the bestowal of the allotment of a leading man is upon<i></i> his inferiors. 25. About the three kinds <i>of</i> righteous men; one that is greater than water <i>and</i> earth, animals <i>and</i> plants, one that is equal <i>to them</i>, and one that is less; and what is the arrangement ofas <i>it were</i>the conjoined formation of those who are somewhat outside of the three kinds.</p>  
 <p>26. About the grievous bridge<i>-judgment</i> for carrying forth dead matter to water, or to fire, with which <i>there</i> is evidence; and the heaviness of the spirit due to dead matter in the water. 27.

 <p><i>or</i> that of the serpent <i>or</i> frog, out of the water. 28. About the destruction of the serpent and frog, and other aquatic noxious creatures, in the water when it is <i>only</i> thus possible, <i>and</i> carrying <i>them</i> out from it when it is possible. 29. About the gratification of the spirit of the world, <i>and</i> the vexation of the demons, owing to the destruction of them.</p>  
 <p>30. Where <i>and</i> what are the tokens of the good <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">1</font></a> management and well-operating drinking-party (tô<i>s</i>tîh) of a neighbour not of the same district (ahamshat<i>r</i>ô nazd). 31. About the sin of him who, after joining a drinking-party from sunset (hû-frâshmôkdâ<i>d</i>ŏ), pulverizes the road (râh tekhnunê<i>d</i>ŏ), keeps the door opened, <i>and</i> would unlawfully make an uproar.</p>  
 <p>32. About Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>having</i> produced the bodies <i>and</i> members of animalsthrough <i>having</i> created the body of the sole-created ox with satisfaction, as assistance for mankindbecause <i>they</i> are repeated for protection, and also <i>for</i> the ceremonial for sacred beings specially declared. 33. About the reason of making offerings (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>ŏ) to the sacred beings, for the increase of power of the allotters of destiny in the allotment of destiny; the connection of that acknowledgement (pa<i>d</i>îri<i>s</i>nŏ) and <i>of</i> the benefit <i>and</i> advantage of the recompense thereof; the proper maintenance <i>of</i> that acknowledgement, through the means <i>and</i> efficacy <i>of</i> the spiritual bridge<i>-judgment</i> of sin, and the fear of worldly disaster and harm from not properly maintaining the perpetual acknowledgement in force</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (dên patûkîh), <i>and from</i> the setting up even of ruin thereby; the reasonable control of the offering to each one of the sacred beings therein is for the skilful member of the community (hûnarîk dâhm) of whatever kind, <i>and</i> is not produced by intrusting the consecration to the violent, more particularly to those whom <i>one</i> specially enumerates; the sin and retribution owing to <i>having</i> given <i>it</i> to those who are of that class; <i>and</i> more upon the same subject.</p>  
 <p>34. About the damage and injury of the world owing to greed (<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ) and its fellow-miscreations, <i>and</i> him who is their supporter and abettor, the idolator (dêvîyastô), also the wolf of many kinds and noxious creatures of various species; because the occurrence of their fiendishness is due to the original fiend, <i>and</i> the means for strengthening their fiendishness are <i>derived</i> from the destruction of all mankind <i>and</i> the other primary worldly creations which are aiding mankind. 35. Advice to mankind about smiting and destroying the evil domination (dû<i>s</i>khshasarînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the world <i>by</i> those <i>injurers</i>, and the merit manifest for them<i>selves</i> therein; the object <i>and</i> spiritual reward for smiting <i>and</i> killing each one of the wolves <i>and</i> noxious creatures, <i>and</i>, as regards the same reward, the perfection of that for destroying a two-legged wolf <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject.</p>  
 <p>36. About advice as to not reverencing the evil spirit and demons, whereby the observing (var<i>z</i>ŏ) of the several ceremonies and gratifications of the sacred beings <i>would be</i> more particularly irregular in <i>any</i> manner whatever, and the damage and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>harm <i>owing</i> to those <i>who are</i> irregular <i>and</i> ill-observant, through being inclined for that irregularity <i>and</i> ill-observance, <i>would</i> become an oppressive presidence (pa<i>d</i>gahîh) of the demons over the creatures; also the vice of clamorous talking (drâyân gôgîh) <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the damage owing thereto, <i>and</i> the pleasure of the demons due to the same <i>and</i> other <i>things</i> which are irregular. 37. Advice about the reason, habit, <i>and</i> primitive practice of not chattering, and other good customs, during eating <i>and</i> drinking; the gratification of the sacred beings owing to that primitive practice of good customs <i>by</i> mankind, and the unself-devoting (a-khvê<i>s</i>-dâk) is he who is not maintaining <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>38. Through the ceremonial of which sacred being is the greater welcome (mâhmânŏtarîh) of a high-priest <i>and of</i> any good work <i>of</i> each one of the five periods of the day and night; the reward and advantage owing to celebrating the ceremony of each of them separately in its own period, and also other means <i>and</i> regulations in the same statement.</p>  
 <p>39. It is righteousness <i>that is</i> perfect excellence.</p>

It appears from this section that the dead matter of an evil creature, such as a snake or frog, was considered to pollute the water as much as that of a good creature. § 28, however, admits the expediency of killing noxious creatures in the water when it is impossible to take them out beforehand; and this is in accordance with Vend. V, 35-38 (W.) which teaches that an apostate defiles no one when dead (any more than a dried-up frog that has been dead a year), because he defiles while living. This rule was evidently intended to remove all scruples as to killing such creatures, but it applies to them only when recently killed; hence the necessity of removing them, from any place liable to <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a> pollution, as soon as possible after death, common sense being preferable to logical consistency.</p>
