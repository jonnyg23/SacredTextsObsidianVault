 <p>1. The thirteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Ta<i>d</i>-thwâ-peresâ <a name="fr_1417"></a><a href="#fn_1385"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is <i>that</i> the obeisance <a name="fr_1418"></a><a href="#fn_1386"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the archangels is performed by him who is educated in the recitation <i>for</i> the archangels of <i>one</i> learned in the religion, which is when <i>he has</i> to understand the recitation and to maintain the recitation of revelation with propriety, which is when an enumeration, or form (âînakŏ), as to the qualities of the archangels exists, which is the obeisance <i>for</i> the sacred beings. 2. For, on this subject, one mentions seven kinds <i>of men</i> <a name="fr_1419"></a><a href="#fn_1387"><font size="1">3</font></a>, educated, or well-educated, or ill-educated, who are connected with it in statements by those of the world; the merely educated <i>man</i>, particularly also the physician, explains this which is not mentioned <i>and</i> does not occur, that <i>it is</i> well, or ill, disposed <a name="fr_1420"></a><a href="#fn_1388"><font size="1">4</font></a>; the merely well-educated <i>man</i>, particularly also the physician, explains this which is mentioned <i>and</i> occurs, that <i>it is</i> well-disposed; the merely ill-educated <i>man, and</i></p>

 <p>also the physician, explains this which is mentioned <i>and</i> occurs, that <i>it is</i> ill-disposed; and the merely uneducated <i>man</i> explains anything whatever that is really life <a name="fr_1421"></a><a href="#fn_1389"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 3. <i>One</i> educated in the recitation <i>for</i> the sacred beings, who whenon account of the necessity of speaking evil about a learned man<i>he</i> is mischievous (anâg), so that he keeps in viciousness, <i>and has</i> remained in the obeisance <i>for</i> the sacred beings, is called not ransomed (la tâkhtîk). 4. <i>One</i> ill-educated in the recitation <i>for</i> the sacred beings, which is when <i>it happens</i> that he keeps in viciousness, becomes even an apostate who is acquainted with the religion. 5. <i>One</i> uneducated in what <i>pertains to</i> the sacred beings is of two kinds, either good <a name="fr_1422"></a><a href="#fn_1390"><font size="1">2</font></a> and void of learning, or an evil <i>one</i> who is void of knowledge; the good <i>and</i> void of learning worships the sacred beings unobservantly with the proper rites, and the evil <i>one</i> who is void of knowledge thinks to worship the sacred beings un-observantly with improper rites, and <i>has</i> no means of trustworthy reliance upon the religion of the sacred beings and their obeisance. 6. And <i>one</i> well-educated in what <i>pertains to</i> the sacred beings, through the three words of the connected series (ham-pa<i>d</i>vandi<i>s</i>nîh) which is good (khu) and learned <a name="fr_1423"></a><a href="#fn_1391"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and through what <i>pertains to</i> the sacred beings, expounds faithfully the object of the obeisance <i>for</i> the sacred beings.</p>  
 <p>7. This, too, that, by him who teaches to mankind that thing which becomes their hope of eternity, mankind are taught to come to the religion of</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p>the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the Vohûmanic attainment <a name="fr_1424"></a><a href="#fn_1392"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the religion of the sacred beings is to be required wisely for them, its requirement wisely for them is a benefit for the steadfast and becomes a consideration (mînîh) for them, and the consideration of the benefit of the steadfast is through hope of the eternity which is provided for the benefit, on account of which the hope of eternitywhich is the basisis the reason even of the acceptance of the religion.</p>  
 <p>8. This, too, that the perfection of the first among the existences <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1393"><font size="1">2</font></a> is taught by him who <i>has</i> retentively remembered his words; even for this reason, because remembrance is the acme of every perfection. 9. This, too, that he becomes a nourisher of good works who shall perform good works publicly; even for this reason, because others are taught thereby, and good works increase in the world. 10. This, too, that by him who has fruit in the possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the development of the world in virtue <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1394"><font size="1">3</font></a> is taught; even for this reason, because a lawful preserver and a producer of liberality arise through the fruit, they enlarge the root of the power of the angel <i>of</i> liberality, and pluck <i>its</i> fruit; the world is improved thereby, <i>and</i> mankind are taught about <i>it</i>. 11. This, too, that, through complete mindfulness, words <i>and</i> actions <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1395"><font size="1">4</font></a> are truly taught by him whose ceremonial is for complete mindfulness; even for this reason, because there are both words <i>and</i> actions in the ceremonial.</p>  
 <p>12. This, too, that the sagacious creativeness (far<i>z</i>ânak dahîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is taught, which is</p>

 <p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a></p>  
 <p>the exposition, to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1396"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of the production of the renovation; even for this reason, because the advantage of the sagacity of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the consequence of its beginning, and <i>its</i> middle is through the power of the goodness and knowledge of him himself, and because <i>it is</i> destiny as regards the creations; and whoever possesses that power for the assistance of the renovation, is extolled for that sagacity, and <i>people</i> are taught thereby. 13. This, too, that the reward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is appropriated by him who decides about duty and opinion <a name="fr_1429"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">2</font></a>; even for this reason, because, through that discrimination, <i>he is</i> similar to Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>14. This, too, that the recitation of revelation is performed <i>for</i> mankind by him who extends the propagation of the religion <a name="fr_1430"></a><a href="#fn_1398"><font size="1">3</font></a>; even for this reason, because, owing to the gratification of virtuous practisers, virtue increases. 15. This, too, that the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is made progressive <a name="fr_1431"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">2</font></a> by him who shall perform the ceremonial of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because through that performance of his occurs the blessing of the provider of the rite (nîrangînî<i>d</i>âr). 16. This, too, that that perfectly righteous <i>man</i> of just judgment is protected from the annoying spirit <a name="fr_1432"></a><a href="#fn_1399"><font size="1">4</font></a> by him who possesses the resemblance (ângûnagîh) unto Vohûman that they behold and resources through virtue; even for this reason, because the vexation which is partaken by him (<i>the spirit</i>), owing to the just judgment among those of the nature (<i>k</i>îharîkân) of mankind, is redoubled (dôkânî-aîtŏ) by their pleasure owing to the Vohûmanic resemblance, <i>and</i> the annoying spirit</p>

 <p>is disabled (akârî-hênd) <a name="fr_1433"></a><a href="#fn_1400"><font size="1">1</font></a> by that accumulated vexation <i>which</i> occurs for his annoyance.</p>  
 <p>17. This, too, that the exploits of the archangels are taught by him who is really capable in what <i>pertains to</i> the archangels; even for this reason, because they become the hope of a consoling (vê<i>d</i>var) end, and are also indicative of the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, the hope of a virtuous end. 18. This, too, that the words of him who is Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that '<i>people</i> shall become supplicant,' are taught by him who is for the benefiters; even for this reason, <i>because</i> they who are benefiters, on account of an inclination for the religion, make others eager for the religion, and make them mount for prayer. 19. And this, <i>too</i>, that by him who gives anything to a righteous man, this is also done that some one else <i>may</i> give even to him who is vile; even for this reason, because a foundation of liberality is thereby prepared for him <a name="fr_1434"></a><a href="#fn_1401"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>20. Perfect righteousness is excellence.</p>
