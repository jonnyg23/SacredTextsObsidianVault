 <p>1. The twentieth fargar<i>d</i>, Vohû-khshathrem <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is about the oppressive actions of the sovereignty which Dahâk <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">2</font></a> exercised over the earth of seven <i>regions</i>, and the forward progress of his commands owing to a surrounding of terrors.</p>  
 <p>2. About Dahâk's enquiry of the members of the assembly, regarding the reason of the affliction of the collected people, after the cutting <i>up</i> of Yim <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the accession (khû<i>d</i>âyih) of Dahâk; and the people's saying, <i>in</i> reply to Dahâk, that Yim had kept away want and destitution, hunger and thirst, decay and death, lamentation and weeping from the world, <i>besides</i> the cold and heat of the immoderate mingling of the demon with mankind. 3. And this, too, that <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">4</font></a> 'a giver of comfort was Yimthat is, those things <i>were</i> produced by him which are the comfort of mankindand he was a giver of desire for them, so that his happiness <i>was</i> through the gratification producedthat is, mankind gratified him through virtue. 4. And Aû<i>d</i>ak <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">5</font></a>, who made</p>

And this, too, that 'those who look <i>for</i> a son <i>are</i> made devoid of pregnancy by thee; evil-destined is the monster (<i>s</i>îpist) self-made, the uncompleted demon that it is impossible to seek a remedy for, who does not extend (lâ vâlê<i>d</i>) from <i>himself</i>, that is, no lineage proceeds from him. 6. And thou <i>art</i> a sheep that is a wide-traveller, <i>and</i> keeps the dog <i>away</i> from mankind; thou <i>hast</i> snatched away from us the bright radiance of Yim the splendid <i>and</i> rich in flocks, who came out on every evil contingency, at the approach of</p>

 <p>every winter, <i>or</i> scorched by extreme heat, so as to act for the benefit of his place <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 7. Thou art intelligent, O Bêvarâsp <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">2</font></a>! do thou even tell how this opinion is so, that a bad ruler is a thing which is so bad; he who is a good ruler is our desire, we <i>will</i> give the revenue <i>of</i> taxation (bâhar-i madam-dedrûni<i>s</i>nîh) to him, and anything which is necessary <i>for</i> good government when he shall achieve <i>it</i>.'</p>  
 <p>8. About the smiting <i>by</i> Frê<i>d</i>ûn <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the sake of killing Dahâk; the striking of <i>his</i> club upon the nape of the neck <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">4</font></a> (pilîk), the heart, and even the skull; and Dahâk's not dying from that beating. 9. Then smiting <i>him</i> with a sword, and the formation (va<i>s</i>tanŏ) of noxious creatures of many kinds, from the body of Dahâk, at the first, second, and third blow. 10. The exclamation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Frê<i>d</i>ûn thus: 'Thou shouldst not cut him who is Dahâk, because, if thou shouldst cut him, Dahâk would be making this earth full of serpents, toads (khan-galâk), scorpions, lizards, tortoises, and frogs;' with the mode <i>of</i> binding <i>him</i> with awful fetters, in the most grievous punishment of confinement <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, <i>that</i> when <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk was bound, the report of the same proceeded thus through all the regions, which are seven, that down-stricken is <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk, but he <i>who</i> smote <i>him</i> is Frê<i>d</i>ûn the Âspîkân <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the exalted <i>and</i> mighty. 12.

 <p>tenth winter those particulars <i>were</i> believed, and thus they spoke, that <i>it was</i> owing to <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">1</font></a> Yim that <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk is now smitten by them, because the tidings which are good are not yet gathered unto all the regions, which are seven, and those which are evil do not mention <i>A</i><i>z</i>, nor demand the virtuous maiden (<i>k</i>arâtîk) with importunity, nor even coveted wealth <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 13. This, too, that, when information came to him of women, <i>or</i> property, that seemed to him desirable to possess, <i>they were</i> then admitted by him into a golden cage <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and that, which was completely impregnable (aîrî<i>s</i>tŏ), came on through immaterial space (maînôg-dîvâkîh) to the den (grêstakŏ) of <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk.</p>  
 <p>14. This, too, that, though <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">4</font></a> he who smote him <i>were</i> his brother, or descendant, or kinsman, or any one whatever <i>of his</i> nearest relations, it did not seem to them as that which is grievous, and <i>it was</i> not thought <i>of</i> in their minds, so that it did not occasion them even a reminiscence again; and thus they talked, that <i>if</i> a householder <i>be</i> he <i>that</i> smote, <i>he is one</i> for whom all the fires of the religion are suitable, <i>but</i> that householder <i>being</i> a monarch, he <i>that</i> smote is <i>one</i> who is every way their ruler. 15. This,</p>

 <p>too, that <i>at</i> every place where he came on, <i>and</i> upon which <i>his</i> horse's hoofs (safô) fell, the dense fire from them <i>was</i> for the protection of the horse's body. 16. This, too, that through his confused (gûm<i>ê</i><i>z</i>akŏ) practising <i>of</i> good deeds <i>arose</i> even the evil deeds of <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk.</p>  
 <p>17. About those of the Mâzendarân <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">1</font></a> country <i>having</i> consulted, after the smiting of Dahâk, as to turning (gâ<i>s</i>tanŏ) to Khvanîras <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and driving out Frê<i>d</i>ûn therefrom, <i>and</i> as to the residence offered <i>by</i> the same place through the great number fallen; also, on account of their tallness, there are <i>parts</i> of the wide-formed ocean <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">3</font></a> that come up to <i>their</i> mid-thigh, there are <i>others</i> that <i>are</i> up to the navel, and the deeper places <i>are</i> up to the mouth. 18. And, when they have come to this region, <i>their</i> producing grievous harm and destruction <i>to</i> the poor <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and the coming of the people with complaints to Frê<i>d</i>ûn, and <i>their</i> speaking thus: 'Why didst thou smite <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk, who was a good ruler as to prerogative, so that danger <i>was</i> kept away by him, and an inquisitor (vi<i>g</i>ôyî<i>d</i>âr) from him protected this region from those of the Mâzendarân country?' 19. And they also said this, about the vileness of the Mâzendarâns, and the wretched state of the people of this region as regards them, that is, they then speak thus: 'Since their habits are thus, since they</p>

 <p>20. About the encountering of Frê<i>d</i>ûn with those of the Mâzendarân country on the plain of Pê<i>s</i>ânîgas <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and disputing with them thus: 'You are of the Mâzendar country, <i>and</i> I (anmanŏ) <i>have</i> destroyed <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk by the swiftest ruin, <i>him</i> who was a grievous sovereign of every one, demons <i>and</i> men; for that smiting of him I am produced <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> more overpowering than his limbs made paralyzed by his own enmity, and then you destroy this country of mine, you who are of the Mâzendar country.'</p>  
 <p>21. And the Mâzendarâns thought slightingly (s<i>a</i>pûkŏ) of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, <i>and</i> spoke in a tone of derision thus: 'Should it be so, that thou destroyedst <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk by the swiftest ruin, <i>him</i> who was a good sovereign of both demons and men, and thou art produced <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for that smiting of him, more overpowering than his limbs, even then we <i>will</i> settle in this <i>place</i> and <i>will</i> stay in this <i>place</i>; and <i>it is</i> not thou that <i>art</i> exalted, who <i>art</i> an overgrown (kabed-ârôyi<i>s</i>nŏ) huge sheep with the speech of a hero among other people, <i>and</i> we would not admit thee here.'</p>  
 <p>22. This, too, that 'nevertheless <i>they</i> afterwards fled, and the victorious Frê<i>d</i>ûn pursued <i>them</i> to the</p>

And he made it rush up on the ascent, whereby they are made figures of stone, and they who <i>are</i> of the Mâzendar country are destroyed by him through the smiting of fifties, the smiting of hundreds, the smiting of thousands <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the smiting of myriads, and the smiting of <i>multitudes</i> innumerable <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>24. 'Thus <i>there</i> are destroyed by him, the victorious <i>and</i> mighty Frê<i>d</i>ûn, two-thirds <i>of</i> those of the Mâzendar country, and one-third came out beaten and sick; and never afterwards, O Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! have they who <i>are</i> of the Mâzendar country marched upon this region of Khvanîras, and <i>it has</i> not <i>been</i> imagined by them, even in thinking about <i>it</i>, that they <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">4</font></a> should go <i>there</i>, except those <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">5</font></a> whose names were thus, S<i>p</i>îtîyô<i>s</i>, <i>son</i> of S<i>p</i>ânsnâyô<i>s</i> <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and Arezrâs<i>p</i>âh, <i>son</i> of S<i>p</i>ânsnâyô<i>s</i> <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">7</font></a>, who have wandered (ta<i>g</i>-î<i>d</i>ŏ)</p>
