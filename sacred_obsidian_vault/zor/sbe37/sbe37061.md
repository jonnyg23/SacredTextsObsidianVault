 <p>1. The eleventh fargar<i>d</i>, the Yasna <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is about the assembly of the angels of the spiritual <i>existences</i> on account of the complaint of fire; and the complaint of fire in the assembly, with <i>its</i> statement of this, too <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">2</font></a>: 'I am not <i>of the world</i> here, and from here I <i>will</i> extricate <i>myself</i>, from the earth up to the sky, and there I <i>will</i> shine on to the earth of seven regions, like the moon and sun and even the divinely-produced stars when they shine with their own light.' 2. The words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> about the just complaining of fire as regards the contamination <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the creatures, the impossibility of keeping the fire undisturbed, and satisfying the fire concerning the creation of the creatures for the worldly <i>existence, along</i> with the disturbed condition of fire, too, owing to the impossibility of maintaining <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">4</font></a> the uncreated state which, with the freedom from disturbance of fire also, was better; <i>likewise</i> proclaiming the care <i>of it</i>. 3. And the speech of the fire <i>was</i> thus: 'If <i>there be</i> not that one mode whereby I <i>may</i> thus shine, owing to those that <i>have</i> acted according to my request <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">5</font></a>, thou art aware, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! <i>there</i></p>

 <p><i>are some</i> among the creatures that I cannot grant so much <i>to</i>; therefore carry me away, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! then give me away there! and be thou carrying <i>me</i> away into the midst of Aîrân-v<i>ê</i><i>g</i> <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'</p>  
 <p>4. The propitious <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">2</font></a> fire is from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and it is produced by him in a dwelling, without <i>being</i> handled (ba<i>r</i>â sû<i>d</i>akŏ) <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">3</font></a>, by aid of bringing together <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5. And so he spoke in words thus: 'Such is thine own growth, thou who art my fire! in every dwelling where thou comest, and <i>in</i> every village, every community, and every province; and as exalted as thou are the water and plants, and <i>he</i>, too, who is a guardian spirit of the righteous, when they shall bring forward holy-water for delivering up <i>to</i> thee <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">5</font></a>; <i>and</i>, when they shall bring forward to thee firewood which is dry, a personthrough the light which he observes<i>has</i> spoken of it thus: "This is the Gû<i>s</i>n-as<i>p</i> <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">6</font></a> fire."'</p>  
 <p>6. About so much reward of the hewer and inspector and kindler of the firewoodwhen all three shall do <i>it</i> for the sake of affectionas <i>they</i></p>

 <p><i>are</i> possessing righteousness. 7. About the character <i>and</i> reward of the washer (âsnôtâr) and the producer of the purity and cleansing of that which the fire <i>has</i> dropped <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>of</i> the introducer of the firewood and the washer upwards <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>of</i> the stirrer of the fire and the carrier-away of the firewood, who are strictly directed; the lawful work done with a <i>cooking-</i>pot <i>and</i> such-like, and the sin of him who is a disturber of it. 8. About the destroyer of that which the fire <i>has</i> dropped, and the introducer of damp firewood into it. 9. About the blessing of fire for people by whom <i>it is</i> satisfied.</p>  
 <p>10. About advice as regards not bringing to the fire that which is due to theft, <i>or</i> the power of extortion, and the grievous bridge-judgment <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">3</font></a> of him who is bringing <i>it; also</i> the defilement (âlû<i>d</i>an) and hurting of the fire from that which <i>occurs</i> when he likewise consecrates his hoard (hanbari<i>s</i>nŏ), owing to the corruption by the demons <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">4</font></a> thus arisen. 11. This, too, that <i>it is</i> owing to want of attention to fire when <i>it is</i> not at every menstrual excitement they produce, <i>in</i> a woman assisted by a propensity</p>

 <p>for a son (pûs ra<i>d</i>îh), <i>that</i> the progeny is a son. 12. And about the penalty for <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">1</font></a> the progress of other impropriety which occurs to fire; also <i>about</i> the person who has attained to the guardianship of fire and does not lawfully control <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>13. About an admonition to Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to consecrating <i>to</i> the sacred beings anything whatever which <i>one</i> eats, and not eating <i>what is</i> unconsecrated. 14. About the wish of the evil spirit that no one shall be performing (vadîdûnâñ-â<i>d</i>ŏ) worship and obeisance to the sacred beings, and <i>that the people</i> shall possess no ruler and high-priest, so that no desire of theirs shall arise for any virtuousness. 15. About an admonition as to indispensably worshipping the sacred beings with the best ceremonial, that of a priest (âsrûkŏ) without sin; <i>or with</i> an average <i>one</i>, that of a priest whose sin is not more than one Aredû<i>s</i> <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">2</font></a> without a basis (<i>a</i>-bûn); <i>or with</i> the lowest <i>one</i>, that of a priest whose <i>sin</i> is not more than one Khôr <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">3</font></a> on a basis (pavan bûn). 16. Whoever, in a village of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, <i>has</i> not chanted the <i>sacred</i> hymns after fifteen years <i>of age</i>, through sinfulness, is as a dog they <i>have</i> thrown provisions <i>to</i>, and it <i>has</i> occurred for a basis of the sin of unseasonable chattering <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">4</font></a>; also the inadmissibility of his soul by Mânsarspend <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">5</font></a>,</p>

 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. About the coming of Ast-vîdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">1</font></a>, at all times, to mortals whom death has reached <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and also whom <i>it has</i> not. 18. About the ideas of the wicked, that the best existence does not exist, <i>that</i> the production of the renovation <i>of the universe</i> does not occur, <i>that there are</i> no dead whom they raise up thereby, and <i>it is</i> not that change <i>one</i> attains. 19. This, too, that is false, for the same <i>reason</i> they observe, <i>being</i> wicked; because the best existence exists, <i>there</i> occurs a production of the renovation which is good, they raise up the dead thereby, and thus <i>one</i> attains that change.</p>  
 <p>20. About an admonition as to not making lamentation and weeping over those passed away; and, after the passing away of every righteous <i>one</i> of the religion to the spirits, <i>one</i> is not to augment the distress of the very spirit of life by making lamentation and weeping over the departed. 21. And this, too, that the guardian spirits of the righteous claim no lamentation and weeping after their own ceremonial and the blessing of righteous men. 22. This, too, that the body of every one is not of like will with the soul; food is the desire of the body, and also a store of wealth; righteous action is the desire of the soul, and also the gifts which they give away.</p>  
 <p>23. About an enquiry of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to who it is who has banished (<i>â</i>pârinî<i>d</i>ŏ) all goodness and perfection from his own <i>self, but</i> thinks <i>them</i> not banished, and does not complain of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>that loss <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 24. And the reply of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that it is he <i>who</i> is deceived <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">2</font></a> by his own tongue through the utterance of words, so that, through speaking falsely, he has become worthy of death. 25. This, too, that for him it is the weapon of the evil spirit; <i>even</i> so complete mindfulness is the reign of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and thus a liar is more a power for the religion when a man, on account of dulness of thought, <i>gives</i> no reply, so that he <i>may</i> not speak falsely through dulness of thought.</p>  
 <p>26. This, too, that he worships the demons with thousand-fold holy-water, who establishes him who is not a member of the community <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">4</font></a> in the Zôti duty <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">5</font></a>, sooner than him who is a wise Zôti. 27. And this, too, that thou shouldst fetch him who is a member of the community for the Zôti duty, not him who is not a member of the community, for thus thy advance is to the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânŏ). 28. Also this, that a bad Zôti is worse from the Zôti duty.</p>  
 <p>29. This, too, that that which is the earliest controller (ayûkhtâr) of sin is thought <i>which</i> is subdued <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">6</font></a>, then forgiveness, then shame, and then listening; and, afterwards, through the sinfulness of the fiend <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">7</font></a>,</p>

 <p><i>one</i> becomes a promise-breaker. 30. This, too, that they shall bring every man who is a wounder before the convocation <i>composed of</i> any priest who is a controller of recitation (srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ ayûkhtâr), any priest who is of the district (âdehîk), any priest who is of an out-district (aû<i>z</i>dehîk), and any priest who is <i>the man's</i> own kinsman.</p>  
 <p>31. 'Thus say I unto thee, O Spîtâmân! let <i>there be</i> no breach of promise; neither when the conversation, that they would make a support, <i>was</i> with the wicked, and there is no great judiciousness in it; nor when <i>it was</i> with those of thine own religion, the righteous, as to anything <i>of</i> great judiciousness; because both of them are promises, both <i>with</i> the wicked and the righteous <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>32. It is the excellence <i>of</i> righteousness <i>that is</i> perfect.</p>
