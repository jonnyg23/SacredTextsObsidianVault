 <p>1. The fifteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Kamnamaêza <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">4</font></a>, is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>about the arrival of Ast-vîdâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">1</font></a> upon the spot, and the insecurity of any one from him; also the non-continuance of the mortal body and decaying (farsâvand) wealth of any one of the mortals summoned is death <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 2. And this, too, that Ast-vîdâ<i>d</i> shall carry off all mortals by that awful and proclaimed marvel, and they are not saved from him <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">3</font></a>; each one, indeed, saves only <i>that</i> which is the soul. 3. This, too, that the soul alone sees the reward and bridge <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the spiritual <i>existence</i>, and embodied it does not see such <i>things;</i> if, <i>when</i> embodied, it could have seen like that, then it would not have committed the sin really originating with it, even for anything whatever <i>of</i> the ease and comfort of the worldly existence, nor shrunk (mansî<i>d</i>ŏ) from the first good work.</p>  
 <p>4. About the hideousness and frightfulness of the body of man after death, and only that which is considered by every one the most precious of desirable things is undecaying (<i>a</i>farsâk). 5. As regards the casting away of the dust, and also living people, that which is more nearly connected therewith is</p>

 <p>uninhabitableness <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">1</font></a> and its duration. 6. And when, too, this way, the consciousness is in the vicinity of the body <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the dog and bird go forth for the dismemberment of the body, the frightening of the consciousness by them is like <i>that of</i> a sheep by a wolf; also <i>its</i> disputing with the dog and bird about the dismemberment of the body, the reciting (mâr<i>d</i>anŏ) of words spiritually <i>at</i> first repelling them, thinking the body is alive. 7. And, afterwards, when the body is dismembered by them, the hastening of the consciousness to the vicinity of the dismembered body, just like a female (dênû<i>d</i>akŏ) sheep when it hastens on to <i>its</i> young ones; <i>and its</i> noticingwith grievous unhappiness <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">3</font></a> for the bodyand recounting where the features (dêmagânŏ) of that body were in happiness, and to what misery it has now come. 8. And, when that body became sinful in <i>its</i> lifetime, about its not accepting, during that lifetime, that which the consciousness repeatedly well-endeavoured to promote for that body, as regards abstaining from sin and practising good works.</p>  
 <p>9. This, too, that thy time of worldly happiness <i>has</i> occurred, and that of misery is long. 10. This, too, that the people who live on, in the worldly <i>existence</i>, a hundred years are less than those who do not live a hundred years; the progress of a lifetime, little <i>by</i> little, and the rushing on of a lifetime; wife and property and the rest <i>of</i> worldly <i>things</i> all</p>

 <p>leaving you at once, and coming to another person. 11. And this, too, thatwhen mankind mostly keep up any statement (nisang-i<i>k</i>) <i>or</i> register (aêvar<i>g</i>-ŏ) which they have drawn out (na<i>z</i>î-hênd) <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">1</font></a> about ordainable supplies in a friendly <i>or</i> inimical (patyân-mônd) way, which is more particularly expedient for thema supply, suitable for the discreet, of the rest of that which is constantly desirable, is to be extracted therefrom, and <i>one</i> is to keep up<i></i> its preparation with his own.</p>  
 <p>12. About the seven immortal rulers who are produced in the region of Khvanîras <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and also about the ordaining of their glory and the goodness, too, of <i>their</i> assistants living <i>and</i> privileged in both existences. 13. The tree opposed to harm <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">3</font></a> is on Aîrân-v<i>ê</i><i>g</i> <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">4</font></a>, in the place of most excavations (frêhnigânân gâs). 14.

 <p><a name="fn_606"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_611">200:1</a> See Chap. XII, 17. The connection of the demon of death with Yas. XLVI is that the first few words of that ha are supposed to be repeated by the wicked soul in despair after death (see Yt. XXII, 20, W.; Mkh. II, 159; AV. XVII, 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_607"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_612">200:2</a> K has mar<i>d</i>ûm, 'human (?).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_608"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_613">200:3</a> B has the whole of this first clause thus:'And the unconsumed (<i>a</i>pakhshînŏ) property of him who is surprised by the invisible marvel that he shall endure, they have not saved from him.' This marvel is probably the supposed casting of a noose by Ast-vîdâ<i>d</i>, around the neck of the dead to drag him to hell, which only the righteous are able to cast off.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_609"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_614">200:4</a> See Bk. VIII, Chaps. XIV, 8, XXIV, 10.</p>

All these forms of the name imply that he was a king, or master, of oxen; and Mkh. describes him as a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping minotaur on the sea-shore, probably the Caspian, or the river Oxus, as Bd. makes him a brother, or nephew, of Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i> the Turânian. His country is called S<i>a</i>ukavastân in Bd., and Gôpatŏ in Dd.</p>

But K, by omitting the negative prefix, places it <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a> 'within the countries of Irân;' and Mkh. makes Gôpaîtŏ a chief of Aîrân-v<i>ê</i><i>g</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_620"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_625">203:2</a> A fortified settlement, to the east of Irân (see Bd. XXIX, 10), formed by Sîyâvakhsh (see Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 14) who was first cousin of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's great-grandfather (see Bd. XXXI, 25, 28, 29).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_621"></a><a href="sbe37065.htm#fr_626">203:3</a> Who are expected to be led into Irân by Pêhshôtanû in future times, when he is summoned by the angels to restore religion to the world after the conflict of the nations (see Byt. III, 25-42).</p>

III, 59-62). It may be connected with the vairi Pisanangh of Yt. V, 37, where Keresâspa offered sacrifice, and with the Pi<i>s</i>în valley south-east of Qandahâr; but Chap. XXI, 20 seems to place it between Mâzendarân and Irân, and Mkh. LXII, 20 also describes it as near Mount Dimâvand. Its name is variously written Pê<i>s</i>inâ<i>s</i>, Pe<i>s</i>ânsih, Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî, Pê<i>s</i>ândas, Pê<i>s</i>ânîgas, &amp;c.</p>
