 <p><a name="fn_927"></a><a href="sbe37082.htm#fr_934">261:5</a> Ibid. 6 a. It is said, in Bd. XXX, 30, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> comes to the world as Zôti, or chief officiating priest, with Srôsh as assistant priest, just before the renovation. Here it is not absolutely certain whether Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, or Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is meant as Zôti on this first occurrence of the word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_928"></a><a href="sbe37082.htm#fr_935">261:6</a> Reading min A<i>ê</i>-zemnôân pavan zôt gâs; Ayazem being an ancestor of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, eleven generations back, the grandfather of Spitama, and the name being variously written Aiazemn, Ayâzem, Nayâzem, and Aizim in different MSS. Another reading is min 3 zamôn khûpŏ zôt gâs, 'from three-fold <i>procreation, has</i> the happy position of Zôti,' referring to the legendary account of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's origin, as detailed in the seventh book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>. The position of the Zôti is at the north end of the ceremonial area.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_929"></a><a href="sbe37082.htm#fr_936">262:1</a> This and the two following persons are the Vohvasti <i>son</i> of Snaoya, Isva<i>d</i> <i>son</i> of Varâza, and Saêna <i>son</i> of Ahûm-stû<i>d</i>, of Yt. XIII, 96, 97.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_930"></a><a href="sbe37082.htm#fr_937">262:2</a> In the great ceremonies of ancient times the Hâvanân appears to have been the priest who attended to the Hôm-mortar, and his position was near the north-west corner of the ceremonial area; the Âtarevakhsh was the priest who fed the fire, and his position was near the south-west corner; the Frabar<i>d</i>âr was the priest who brought the necessary utensils, and his position was near the northeast corner; and the Srôshâvar<i>z</i> was the priest who kept general order, his position being at the south end, facing the Zôti at the north end. Besides these five priests, mentioned in our text, there were three others enumerated in Vîsp. III, 1; Vend. V, 58, VII, 17, 18, the water-bringer near the south-east corner, the washer on the west side, and the cleanser on the east side. In modern times the Zôti retains his ancient duties of chief priest, while the Râspî (Bk. VIII, Chap. VII, 5, 9) combines the duties of the seven others, being called by the Zôti (in Vîsp. III, 1) to take the place of each of them in succession.</p>
