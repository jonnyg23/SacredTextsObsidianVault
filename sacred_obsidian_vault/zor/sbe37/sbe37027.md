 <p>1. The first section of the <i>last</i> thirty-five is the Stôristân ('<i>beast-of-burden code</i>'), particulars about the sin, affecting the soul, due to unlawfully striking and wounding as regards beasts <i>of burden and</i> cattle; <i>and</i> the retribution and compensation for it to one's own cattle, that in case of a beast <i>of burden and</i> that in case of a sheep (anûm<i>â</i><i>ê</i>), during life. 2. That which <i>arises</i> when <i>one smites</i> them with a brand (dakhshak); that when <i>one</i> smites them on the flank, <i>and</i> that when <i>it is</i> in front of them; that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>when their flanks are so smitten is complete smiting. 3. Of the smiting, too, <i>of</i> other members, the smiting in front, though the smiting <i>be</i> such as when <i>one</i> so smites for smiting on the flank, is not complete smiting. 4. And that which amounts to as much as a complete smiting, when <i>one</i> so smites as for smiting on the flank, is such as that when <i>one casts off</i> the skin, and that when <i>one</i> casts off the flesh, thereby, that when <i>one</i> is cutting it, <i>or</i> that when wounds (khîmân) or serpent-scourging (mârvanô) <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">1</font></a> are <i>upon</i> it.</p>  
 <p>5. It is also about making the dog which drives the sheep (pasû<i>s</i>-haûrvô) dumb. 6. About bruising the limbs and plucking the feathers of birds, such as the <i>case</i> when <i>it is</i> complete smiting, and such as that when <i>it is</i> not complete smiting. 7. And unlawfully destroying as regards fish, such as when it would make their flesh uneatable. 8. An account as to noticeably and worryingly beating cattle, about decrees of whatever kinds as to each separate beating worryingly that is to be considered as noticeable beating, <i>and</i> many decrees as to whatever is on the same subject. 9. About the retribution for making clothing of skins and woven <i>wool</i> (ta<i>d</i>akŏ), and the sin of any one owing to kindling a fire therewith, <i>or</i> roasting flesh which is stolen <i>or</i> plundered.</p>  
 <p>10. About the good work <i>of</i> all that is wise activity, and the reward of the happy place <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">2</font></a>; the sin of every<i>thing</i> that is ignorant activity, and the</p>
