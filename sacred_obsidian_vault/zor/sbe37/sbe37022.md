 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="sbe37022.htm#fr_155">44:2</a> These two kinds of injury, usually written bâîô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>ŏ and kâîtyôk-<i>g</i>a<i>d</i>ŏ in the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, are mentioned in Farh. Oîm, pp. 32, l. 8-34, l. 2, as follows:'<i>Av</i>. baodha<i>g</i>a<i>d</i> = <i>Pahl</i>. bô<i>d</i>ô-zê<i>d</i> <i>and</i> <i>Av</i>. baodhô-var<i>s</i>tahê = <i>Pahl</i>. bô<i>d</i>ôk-var<i>s</i>t are as <i>it were</i> "observantly assaulted," and <i>one</i> mentions <i>them</i> most about the assault and injury of anything which is noticeable. Through falsehood other noticeable sin is small, <i>and</i> is subdued through <i>being</i> devoid of an injurer, as the assault <i>and</i> injury of anything through wear is a small sin. Kâîtyô-ge<i>d</i> is a sin for mankind, which is a degree of Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>, <i>but</i> less; so also the decree (dastînak) is different from Bô<i>d</i>ôk-var<i>s</i>t. The principal Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>, that of animals with observance, the Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i> through wear, <i>and</i> the Kâîtyôk-zê<i>d</i> sin towards people are sins which are hamêmâlân ("affecting accusers"). The dissipating weapon for sin dissipates the sinfulness of the other sin, which is called rûbânîk ("affecting the soul").'</p>

Oîm, pp. 34, l. 8-35, l. 1: '<i>Av</i>. ha<i>n</i>dereiti, <i>Pahl</i>. handeretŏ, is that when, owing to negligence, <i>one</i> keeps any one exhausted; when <i>one</i> would make him fallen who is of the ruined, or him who is a master of arms, and <i>has</i> imprisoned him, the causing of much anguish thereby is the committal of incarceration.'

 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="sbe37022.htm#fr_165">49:2</a> According to Vend. IV, 35, if a man wounds another so that the blood comes, and does this for the <i>fourth</i> time, he becomes an outcast and receives the maximum punishment. Also, when a person walks without the sacred girdle or shirt (Vend. XVIII, 59), it is at the <i>fourth</i> step that the demons possess him.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="sbe37022.htm#fr_171">51:1</a> A Hâsar (Av. hâthra) is a measure of distance, as well as of time. This is stated in Farh. Oîm, pp. 41, l. 11-42, l. 3, thus:'Of the Hâsar there are also several kinds that express measurement. A medium Hâsar on the ground, which they call also a Parasang, is a thousand steps of two feet which have to walk. With the lapse of time of a medium Hâsar the day and night are computed.' Again, p. 43, ll. 1-3 state that 'of twelve Hâsars is the longest day; that day and night in which is the longest day are twelve of the longest Hâsars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the least.' From this it appears that an average Hâsar of distance is a thousand paces, or Roman mile; and an average Hâsar of time is one hour and twenty minutes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="sbe37022.htm#fr_172">52:1</a> Possibly hûmat, hûkht, hûvarst, 'good thoughts, good words, and good deeds,' which would be accepted as a sign of repentance.</p>
