 <p>1. The seventh fargar<i>d</i>, Tâ-v<i>e</i>-urvâtâ <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is <i>that</i> by him who possesses advantage through virtue, the world of righteousness is <i>freed</i> from <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">3</font></a> destruction <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">4</font></a>; even for this reason, because the possession of advantage through virtue arises through the non-participation of the demons <i>and</i> the vile therein, and the participation of, the sacred beings <i>and</i> the</p>

 <p>good; and, when <i>one</i> shall act so, the advantage of spiritual origin becomes more powerful through guarding the advantage from the destroyers. 2. This, too, that, by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in <i>his</i> person, apostates are likewise forced to make the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> progressive <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">1</font></a>; even for this reason, because owing to <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1268"><font size="1">2</font></a> the apostasy of apostates <i>being</i> a religion produced by Aharman, <i>they are</i> only able to make the religion progressive through the appellation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; apostasy <i>and</i> priesthood, <i>and</i> the apostates <i>and</i> priests, are fraternal opponents, and whenever the priesthood and multitudes of the priesthood are triumphant, multitudes of the apostates of apostasy perish (aôshênd), and when the multitudes of the apostates of apostasy are bold, the priests of the priesthood are weak; and the priests are superior <i>in</i> power <i>and</i> success when their priesthood is properly limited, and their properly-limited priesthood, toowhich can arise through mankindconsists in the welcome precedence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>3. About the completeness (s<i>p</i>ôrîkîh) <i>of</i> the priesthood in that quality now, when the priests of the multitude are the habitation (mêhônŏ) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, <i>and</i> the power of the priests of the priesthood <i>has</i> increased, the valour of the apostates of apostasy is smitten, and the apostates are defeated <i>by</i> the abundant splendour of the priests, also their power as regards making the religion of Aharman progressive through the appellation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is fettered, <i>and</i> they keep apostasy concealed <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1269"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 4. And then also they, with the appellation of priests, truly speak and teach the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and make <i>it</i> progressive, just as it is solemnized and made easy by them, even Though the will <i>of</i> the sacred beings <i>be</i> unheard <i>and</i> undesired through apostasy.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, that he proclaims the miraculousness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1270"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who shall appoint for ordeal that which is certainly a doubt; even for this reason, because, through accomplishing an ordeal, that which is doubtful is forcibly rendered visible (vên<i>â</i><i>v</i>dahakî-aîtŏ) to the eyes, as certain clearness, through the power of the spirit, <i>which</i> is itself a miracle of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 6. This, too, that by him who shall make a public decision thereon, <i>as to</i> the acquitted and convicted <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">2</font></a>, gratification is afforded to him whose maintenance of the dispute <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">2</font></a> is righteous; even for this reason, because the needful is delivered by him to its own requirer <i>who</i> thereby becomes even renowned. 7. This, too, that even the rite of ordeal [is produced] <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">3</font></a> by him [who is an advantage to the righteous; for this reason, because the rite of ordeal is for the advancement of the ordeal, and the religious ordeal] proceeds through sovereignty; these righteous are those of the good religion, and their advantage is that belonging to the multitude, which is the sovereignty now, <i>and</i> every one who is given for that advantage, to the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>righteous <i>of</i> those of the good religion, becomes the performer of any rite of ordeal really produced, because the origin of that giving of advantage is even the rite of ordeal. 8. This, too, that by him who gives a priest and righteous <i>man</i> for propagating the religion, the rite of ordeal is also proclaimed; even for this reason, because the teacher and one rightly merciful (hû-âmûr<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>âr) give <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">1</font></a> the sacred text by which even the rite of ordeal is declared.</p>  
 <p>9. This, too, that <i>he</i> who recites the revelation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and who shall do <i>it</i> with exceeding goodness, becomes an increaser of wisdom; even for this reason, because the wisdom of a man increases in these two ways, either he speaks <i>and</i> teaches himself, or he exemplifies the excellence of a portion to the wise who become speakers and teachers of wisdom. 10. This, too, that his homage is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who thoroughly teaches a righteous employer <i>of</i> animals and human beings (kî<i>r</i>â vavîr) that he considers <i>him</i> as their controller (dastôbar); because, since the productiveness of the completion of the creatures is produced through the nourishment of the creatures <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> through his fulfilling his own productiveness, that righteous employer <i>in</i> the world is <i>intended</i> for the nourishment of his creatures, owing to that outward subjection and propitiation of theirs, <i>and</i> the righteous employer is connected with <i>their</i> subjection and propitiation <i>for</i> the creator.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the soul is given to Zaratû<i>s</i>t;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>even for this reason, because with a man's <i>having</i> given thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is connected the receiving of his soul <i>by</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t for preservation from hell. 12. This, too, that by him who teaches the nature of the sacred beings to mankind, consultation with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is also further taught; even for this reason, because the nature of the sacred beings is consulting a spiritual lord, <i>and</i> becomes also the consulting of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>13. This, too, that by him who keeps the produce of sheep as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, a sheep is given to him who is diligent <i>and</i> moderate <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">1</font></a>; even for this reason, because produce kept as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is for <i>being</i> given for good works, <i>being</i> given for good works is <i>being</i> truly kept as a beginning for the possession of produce, and a beginning truly kept is kept even through a sheep, as a beginning of excellence, in the control (dastôbarîh) of him who is a diligent <i>and</i> moderate shepherd <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 14. This, too, that by him who is liberal to the liberal the increase owing to developers is brought into the world; even for this reason, because a liberal <i>man</i>, on account of even that gift given back to the worthy, becomes even for usthrough the development of the worldhim who is first praised therein with the sacred beings. 15. This, too, that whoever shall form a store for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development <i>of</i> sheep <i>by</i> the creator; because, on account of the increase of sheep through the existence of nourishment for them <i>having</i> arisen, whoever has arranged nourishment for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>of</i> sheep <i>by</i> the creator. 16. This, too, that by him who teaches <i>inward</i> prayer (v<i>â</i><i>k</i>akŏ) to the good, it is also taught <i>to</i> eaters; even for this reason, because, everything connected with eating <i>being</i> declared by the religion, when the religion is taught by <i>any</i> one to the good, in which even that information is proclaimed, even eaters are taught about it. 17. This, too, that whoever maintains a sheep, <i>or</i> human being, as our property, is taught to maintain it through the high-priest of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; even for this reason, because it <i>is</i> so maintained as the property of the sacred beings, when he maintains <i>it</i> as the property of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>18. This, too, that by him who gave predominance to those of the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the sovereignty also of those of the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is desired; even for this reason, because the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i> is the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 19. This, too, that when <i>one is</i> alone among rulers a way of speaking to the rulers such words <i>as are</i> really true is thereby provided; even for this reason, because the utterance <i>of</i> blessings <i>by</i> a solitary <i>person</i> is for advantage. 20. This, too, that by him who keeps the sovereignty which is his within the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the best thing is done unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because a sovereignty is so kept within the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> when he who is the ruler gives to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the individuality in which is the sovereignty, and when its proximity and closeness have given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> that thing which is best <i>and</i> supreme.</p>  
 <p>21. This, too, that when <i>one</i> teaches the sayings</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (v<i>â</i><i>k</i>akŏ) <i>of</i> the benefiters, the information which is owing to the religion is illustrated <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">1</font></a> by him to his own; even for this reason, because the knowledge of religion, which is in <i>its</i> causing liberality by him, is increased even by the repeated enquiry of disciples. 22. This, too, that by him who teaches an applicant the virtuous way and doctrine (pand) the liturgy is then taught; even for this reason, because knowledge arises through the virtuous course of the liturgy <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 23. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of virtue, the liturgy is maintained <i>and</i> taught with virtuousness <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">2</font></a>; even for this reason, because the maintenance of the liturgy with virtuousness arises through virtuous thinking.</p>  
 <p>24. This, too, that whoever shall provide the nourishment of creatures with propriety, his Vohûman (<i>good thought</i>) is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s progeny <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and whoever properly maintains those which are in his keeping, his position becomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s fatherhood of Vohûman <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">4</font></a> even for this reason, because every proper nourishing is that in which the nourished becomes an offspring such as Vohûman unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and every proper protection of the creatures, over those which are protected by it, is a fatherhood such as <i>that of</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> over Vohûman. 25. This, too, that by him who shall provide nourishment with propriety <i>for</i> the creation which is good, it is taught <i>that</i> the good creation <i>was</i> produced <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because from the nourishment of the creation with propriety, <i>together</i> with the discriminating action of the nourisher, the goodness of the nourished is also</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>evident, from the goodness of the nourished creation the goodness <i>of</i> him who is its creator is evident, and the creator of the good creation is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself.</p>  
 <p>26. This, too, that whoever shall spiritually make Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the ruler over <i>his</i> own person becomes a ruler as to actions <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1281"><font size="1">1</font></a>; even for this reason, because whoever is making Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> ruler over his person is a leader of wisdom, a leader of wisdom is a decider taking account of sin and good works, taking account of sin and good works is abstaining from sin <i>and</i> practising good works, and owing to abstinence <i>from</i> sin and practising good works one becomes a ruler over actions. 27. This, too, that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1282"><font size="1">2</font></a> is given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who is as reverent unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter unto a father; even for this reason, because the Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic nature (S<i>p</i>enda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>îh) is provided by him <i>for</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>28. This, too, that for him <i>who</i> thinks of the care of cattle <i>there</i> arises that wisdom <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1283"><font size="1">3</font></a> which the control (patîh) of cattle gives; even for this reason, because the nature of the wisdom <i>for</i> a production of cattle is provided in mankind, and, when mankind apply <i>their</i> thoughts to seeking that wisdom, they obtain <i>it</i>. 29. This, too, that by him who is admitting the male <i>to</i> cattle at the <i>proper</i> time, the care of cattle is also thought of; even for this reason, because the admittance of the male becomes productiveness, and whoever <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1284"><font size="1">4</font></a> would cause productiveness thinks also of nourishment.</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. This, too, that by him who <i>has</i> prepared <i>him</i>self for the priests the way to yonder <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1285"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>world</i> is taught; even for this reason, because the way to yonder <i>world</i> is declared by the religion, and its indicator is the priest; therefore, by him who is prepared for the priests, through discipleship, that way is known and is made known. 31. This, too, that <i>in</i> him who shall do that which is something that is an assistance to the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, thoughts of the bounty (dahîh) of the creator arise; even for this reason, because creativeness is through thinking of the renovation, thinking of the renovation arises through the renovation, the renovation arises through anything which is done that is an assistance of the renovation, the doing of anything that is an assistance of the renovation is through thinking of sagacity, and thinking of sagacity becomes thoughts of the bounty of the creator.</p>  
 <p>32. This, too, that by him who loves the affairs of the archangels a heart and mind <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>for</i> not being misled from the way of the sacred beings, are recommended to mankind; even for this reason, because from the religion of the sacred beings being loved <i>arises</i> increasing power of the sacred beings, from the increasing power of the sacred beings <i>arises</i> their greater authority among mankind, <i>and</i> from the greater authority of the sacred beings among mankind arises the resistance of heart and mind of mankind, even in their not being misled by the very demons. 33. This, too, that whoever shall act with reverence <i>to</i> Vohûman sees the sin which is concealed in <i>him</i> mingled with good works</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a></p>  
 <p>thereby <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">1</font></a>; even for this reason, because reverence for Vohûman becomes submission (hêrîh) in virtuousness, with virtuous submission are connected freedom from Kîkship and from Karapship <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1288"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and with freedom from Kîkship and from Karapship <i>is connected one</i> sound of life <i>and</i> eye, whereby <i>he is</i> an observant decider, and atonement <i>for</i> sin arises from good works.</p>  
 <p>34. This, too, that by him who shall provide liberality for the liberal, the giving of a loans to mankind is also taught; even for this reason, because liberal giving by any one is accounting for his own debt, and he endeavours to repay <i>it</i> fully observantly and with complete gratification; besides that, the power of liberality becomes extendible among mankind, <i>and</i> through loans and other gifts <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1289"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>of</i> generosity (dahi<i>s</i>nîkîh) they become ardent. 35. This, too, that by him who pays homage (franâmê<i>d</i>ŏ) to the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as much as he is able, the non-injury of the innocent is also taught; even for this reason, because to intertwine further (frôv<i>â</i>ftanŏ) with the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as much as possible, is first <i>to commit</i> no sin <i>and</i> to perform as many good works as possible, <i>and</i> abstaining from the essentials of sin is non-injury of the innocent. 36. This, too, that by him who possesses a ruler and high-priest Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a></p>  
 <p>spiritually made ruler over his person <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">1</font></a>; even for this reason, because, through the requirement of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the angels are lord and master of the worldly <i>existence</i> of that <i>man</i>.</p>  
 <p>37. This, too, that whoever decides duty and opinion becomes also an informer of others; even for this reason, because it informs others that <i>he is</i> possessing wisdom, and this is what is said, that 'the wisdom of a man is evident from <i>his</i> deciding as to affairs.' 38. This, too, that whoever shall provide nurture with propriety becomes also an indicator (dakhshakînî<i>d</i>âr) <a name="fr_1316"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>for</i> others; even for this reason, because the happiness of the nurturer becomes also a happy indicator even <i>for</i> thee; and this, too, is what <i>one</i> says, that 'always good, happy, <i>and</i> free from serfs <a name="fr_1317"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">3</font></a> is he who is not a master of vagabonds (pa<i>d</i>ŏ-î pûân).'</p>  
 <p>39. This, too, that by him who is a ruler who, by a command given, appoints him who is liturgical (mânsarîk), and gives anything to him which it is desirable to give, the necessary demeanour for true <i>and</i> virtuous statements <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">4</font></a> is taught; even for this reason, because the uttering of true <i>and</i> virtuous statements, in fearlessness <a name="fr_1319"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">4</font></a> of rulers, is owing to a well-established sovereignty, and their well-established sovereignty is more particularly through these two <i>things</i>, good commanding and helpfulness; when they establish that liturgical <i>one</i> by a command given <i>it</i> is good commanding, and when they give</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a></p>  
 <p>anything to him which it is desirable to give the helpfulness is provided; also, owing to their good commanding, the helpfulness is a good establishment <i>of</i> the sovereignty, owing to a well-established sovereignty <i>there</i> is fearlessness also in uttering true <i>and</i> virtuous statements, and, owing to freedom from concealment in uttering true <i>and</i> virtuous statements, the necessary demeanour for true and virtuous statements arises. 40. This, too, that <i>he</i> who gives personal service unto the king of kings, and who considers the product (bar) as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is empowered for indicating the acquitted and convicted <a name="fr_1320"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>by</i> the spirits, his indicators of the acquitted <i>and</i> convicted; even for this reason, because the person <i>being</i> given in service to the king of kings is the preparation (nîvâri<i>s</i>nŏ) of subjection, and the product <i>being</i> considered as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is to consider the innocence of <i>its</i> origin (bûn) and to make the product well-selecting (hû-<i>k</i>înakŏ) through virtuousness; owing to the progress of these two, the virtuousness in the world becomes great <i>and</i> increasing productiveness for all the good spiritual and worldly <i>existences</i> which are in it, even those who are angels indicating the acquitted and convicted.</p>  
 <p>41. This, too, that by him who becomes immortal progress <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">2</font></a> for him who is immortally progressive, complete progress <a name="fr_1322"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">2</font></a> is given to him who is completely progressive; and its routine (dâ<i>d</i>istân), too,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a></p>  
 <p>is even this, that by him who wishes <a name="fr_1323"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">1</font></a> to make that which is his own soul immortal, <i>and</i> would afford <i>it</i> assistance, every benefit is given to him who is a supplicant <i>for</i> every benefit <i>and</i> becomes a giver of every benefit which he begs, which becomes an assistance to him whom he asks in attaining thereto. 42. This, too, that whoever gratifies that which is enjoyment renders <i>his</i> soul immortal; even for this reason, because the soul subsists through good works, and good works are all those which gratify enjoyment. 43. This, too, that whoever keeps himself always in good works <a name="fr_1324"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">2</font></a> has produced perfection and happiness by any goodness <i>and</i> worthiness of his; even for this reason, because keeping oneself always in good works becomes perfect diligence in industry, within perfect diligence in industry is also comprised opposition to any harm whatever, and it is opposition to harm and perfect goodness that are worthy of every happiness.</p>  
 <p>44. This, too, that by him who possesses wealth as high-priest of the priests, predominance as their high-priest is maintained <a name="fr_1325"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>and</i> taught; even for this reason, because the provision of sovereignty and <i>its</i> progress are really through wealth. 45. This, too, that by him who would act for the pleasure of others, owing to virtue, the growth <i>and</i> increase owing to Vohûman <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">4</font></a> are produced; even for this reason, because that which has given virtuous pleasure is the nourishment of the creatures by the producer of increase and growth.</p>  
 <p>46. This, too, that by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>
