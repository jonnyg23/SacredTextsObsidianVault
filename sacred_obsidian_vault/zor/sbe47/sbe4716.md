 <p>son of Farukhzâ<i>d</i>, the leader of the orthodox, about several significant questions that <i>are</i> the wonder of the moderns, which <i>are</i> like the friendly words, spoken by him <i>as to</i> those of the ancient tribe <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a> (kâmon-ramân) who call <i>it</i> really their Gyêmarâ, which <i>are</i> obtaining <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">2</font></a> a like wonder for them openly accessible to him <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. About the unswerving <i>and</i> co-operating chieftainship of those forefathers who went in mutually-friendly command of troops, <i>and</i> the complete enclosure of that tribe within the military control of Bûkht-Narsîh <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 5.

And the orthodox belief in the rude particulars <i>of</i> religious custom in the mutual deliberation of those of the tribe, the acquaintance with religion of a boor (durû<i>s</i>takŏ-1), the difficult arrangements, and the enquirer doubtful of the religion after the many controversial, deliberative, and cause-investigating questions and answers adapted to the importunities of that wordy disciple <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. About how the accepting of this religion <i>by</i> the prophets before Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>occurred</i> <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">4</font></a>, how the pure <i>and</i> saintly Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas came <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and who <i>will</i> afterwards come as bringers of the same pure and good religion <i>here</i>after <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 8. That is, of the prophets, apostles, and accepters of the religion, <i>there</i> were <i>they</i> who accepted <i>it</i> concisely <i>and</i> completely <i>such</i> as Gâyômar<i>d</i> was, from whom <i>came</i> irregularly (durû<i>s</i>takŏ) <i>such</i> as Masyê and Sîyâmak, Hâôshâng, Tâkhmôrup, Yim, Frê<i>d</i>ûn, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, the Sâmân, the Kayân, and also many other leaders in <i>those</i> times <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">7</font></a>. 9. And their acceptance expressly at various times is produced for action, and thereby the adversity of the creatures is removed, benefit</p>

 <p><a name="fn_333"></a><a href="sbe4716.htm#fr_337">119:1</a> He was the leader of the orthodox about A<i>D</i>. 815-835, and held a religious disputation with the heretic Abâli<i>s</i> in the presence of the Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A. n. 813-833), as detailed in the Mâ<i>d</i>îgân-î Gu<i>g</i>astak Abâli<i>s</i>. He was also the first compiler of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, probably of its first two Books, which are not yet discovered, as well as of some of the materials for the other Books. (See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 411, n. 1.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_334"></a><a href="sbe4716.htm#fr_338">119:2</a> The name of this MS. can be only guessed. It occurs three times in each of the two MS. authorities, B and K43, and the simplest reading of five of these six occurrences would be Sîmrâ, so that the remaining one (Sarmâ) may be neglected as a corruption. A final â in Pahlavi is a very certain indication of a Semitic word, for if a final of similar form occurs in an Irânian word, it represents either h or kh; so if the name were Irânian, its most probable reading would be Sîmurkh. But, in § 3, it is intimated that the MS. belonged to an ancient tribe, or congregation (ram); it also seems, from Chap. IV, 8, 9, that the religion of this tribe was not so inconsistent with Zoroastrianism, as to prevent its members being taught that orthodox faith; and §§ 4, 5 of the present chapter appear to quote from that MS. some <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a> particulars regarding the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. From these circumstances we may suspect that Âtû<i>r</i>-farnbag, while collecting materials for his Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, had asked some Jewish friends what information their MSS. contained regarding the old Persians, as the two peoples had been in contact, more or less, ever since the time of the Achaemenian dynasty. If he did so enquire, the Jews would naturally search in the Talmud, in which references to the Persians still survive, though the text is no longer complete. The question is, therefore, whether the MS., whose name has been provisionally read Sîmrâ, can have had any connection with the Talmud. It will be at once evident to any Pahlavi student that Pahl. sî may be read gyê equally well, and that we have no better reason for reading Sîmrâ than for the Gyêmarâ, which has been put into the text, as a suggestion that Âtû<i>r</i>-farnbag was really referring to the Gemarâ of the Jews, the supplement to their commentary upon Scripture. Whether this can be clearly proved remains to be seen, and positive evidence seems scanty.</p>
