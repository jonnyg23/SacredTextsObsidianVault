 <p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested and is openly specified after the collapsing of the sovereignty of Irân <i>and</i> the country of Irân; <i>also</i> the end of the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar the descendant of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. There is this marvellousness, really overthrowing the blessedness of the knowledge of former government, revealed by the Avesta about the ninth and tenth centuries, that which is an indicator of circumstances (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) now visible, <i>such</i> as the dispersion of the sovereignty of Irân from the country of Irân, the disturbance of just law <i>and</i> custom, the predominance of <i>those with</i> dishevelled hair <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and</i> the haughty profession of ecclesiastics <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Also the collection and even connection of all their four systems of belief (v<i>â</i><i>v</i>arî-hastanŏ) <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">4</font></a> together</p>

 <p>for the upper rank; the coming of <i>one</i> working with the sacred beings to the inferior, the transient, and the captive of the period; and the dispersion and downfall of dependent and public men in their time.</p>  
 <p>4. The disappearance of a disposition for wisdom from the foreigners <i>in</i> the countries of Irân, which is an indication of shame <i>at</i> the truth of the religion, and <i>at</i> the praise, peace, liberality, and other goodness whose provision <i>has</i> lodgement in a disposition for wisdom. 5. Also the abundance <i>of</i> the decisions of apostasy, the falsehood, deceit, slander, quarrelsomeness, fraudulence, ingratitude, discord, stinginess, and other vileness whose real connection is a disposition to devour, neglecting heedfulness for the archangels of fire, water, and worldly <i>existence</i> <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 6. The oppressiveness of infidelity <i>and</i> idol-worship, the scarcity <i>of</i> freedom, the extreme predominance of avarice in the individuals (tanŏ) of mankind, the plenitude of different opinions about witchcraft, <i>and</i> the much inclination of many for paralyzing the religion of the sacred beings.</p>  
 <p>7. The annihilation of the sovereignty of mankind one over the other, the desolation of localities and settlements by severe actual distress, and the evil foreign potentates who <i>are</i>, one after the other, scattering the valiant; the destruction among cattle <i>and</i> the defilement <i>of</i> the spirit of enjoyment, owing to the lodgement of lamentation and weeping <i>in</i> the countries of Irân, the clamour of the demon-worshipper in the country, <i>and</i> the unobtainable stature, non-existent strength, blighted destiny, and short</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p>  
 <p>life of mankind. 8. Also the abundance of ordinances (âyinŏ) <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">1</font></a> of various descriptions, the approval of the apostate among tyrants and the non-approval of the Zoti <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">2</font></a> who is well-disposed and wise, the coming of the Zoti to want, <i>and</i> all the other adversity, disruption, and running astray which <i>are</i> over-powering even in districts <i>and</i> localities of the countries of Irân.</p>  
 <p>9. The maintenance of no ritual (<i>a</i>pandîh) of the religion of the sacred beings; the weakness, suffering, and evil habits of those <i>of</i> the good religion; the lamentation and recantation (khûstûkîh) of the upholders of the religion; <i>and</i> the wickedness and extermination of good works in most of the countries of Irân. to. Also much other misery in these two centuries is recounted in the Avesta, which passed away with them and is also now so visible therein, and manifestly occurs in them.</p>  
 <p>11. This, too, is a statement (nisang-1) as to them, <i>which</i> revelation mentions thus: 'That is the age mingled with iron (that is, from every side they perceive <i>it is</i> of iron) in which they bring forth into life him who is a sturdy praying apostate. 12. This is their sturdiness, that their approval is unobservant of both doctrines (âînakŏ); and this is their praying, that whenever <i>it is</i> possible for them they shall cause misery to others; <i>also</i> when an old man publicly advances into a crowd (galakŏ) of youths, owing to the evil times in which that man who is learned is born, they are unfriendly <i>to him</i> (that is, they are no friends of the high-priests of the priestly assembly). 13. They are freely speaking (that is,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p>  
 <p>they utter phrases smoothly), they are wicked and are fully maliciously talking, so that they shall make the statements of priests and high-priests useless; they also tear asunder the spiritual lordship <i>and</i> priestly authority, and shall bring the ruler <i>and</i> priestly authority into evil behaviour as vicious, but they bring together those <i>who are</i> singular. 14. Anything they say is always mischief (agîh), and that district which had a judge they cast into the smiting precinct, into hell; it is misery without any intermission they shall inflict therein, till they attain unto damnation (darvandîh) through the recitation they persevere in, <i>both</i> he who is the evil progeny disseminated by the apostate <i>and</i> he who is the villainous wolf full of disaster <i>and</i> full of depravity.'</p>  
 <p>15. 'Here <i>below</i> they fight, the friend with him who is a friend, they also defraud (zîvênd) him of his own work (that is, whenever it is possible for them, they shall seize upon his property), and they give it to him from whom they obtain prosperity in return; if not, they seek him who is acting as a confederate (nishîn-gûn), and they make that other <i>one</i> defraud the poor <i>man</i> (so that they shall seize upon his property); they also cheat him when he shall make complaint. 16. I <i>shall</i> not again produce such for thee, no friend here for him who is a friend, no brother for him who is a brother, no son for him who is a father, nor yet a father <i>for</i> him who is a son; admonished, <i>but</i> not convinced, they become the abode of the will of the place, so that they subsist in every single place where it is necessary for them <i>to be</i>, in each that is necessary for them they march on together, and on the way they reflect upon the path of blessedness and the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>manifold learning they utter owing to knowledge of me <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>17. 'These three, our increase, learning, <i>and</i> reward, we fully understand through the ascendancy <i>of</i> him who is ignoble, <i>and</i> through the downfall <i>of</i> him who is noble <i>and</i> superior to him of little thorough instruction who, in every thing, <i>will</i> be at the foot of the tyrant. 18. Thinking of a priest <i>one</i> becomes spiritual, thinking of a tyrant one becomes a Kavîg <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">2</font></a>; a demon <i>in</i> disposition is an incipient demon, a Kavîg <i>in</i> disposition is himself attracted towards a youth.'</p>  
 <p>19. Then, when character and wisdom recede from the countries of Irân (that is, they depart), so <i>that</i> destitution and also winter, produced by demons who are worshipping the demon, rush together from the vicinity of disaster (vôighn) on to the countries of Irân, where even rain becomes scanty and pestilence is secretly advancing and deceiving, so that deaths become numerous; thus even <i>he</i> of perverted wisdom, who is wicked, and the apostate also, who is unrighteous, rush together in companionship. 20. As what <i>one</i> says they <i>all</i> exclaim thus: 'Consume and destroy, <i>O</i> ruler! for <i>it</i> is to be consumed and destroyed by thee; destroy even the fire, consume even as food those who are the protection of the association enforcing <i>religious</i> obedience, and those leading on the poor <i>man</i> of the righteous dispensation by their guidance.' 21. So that they shall make him thoroughly detached and smite him;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>likewise wisdom is the wealth they bring him, <i>and</i> it is when property is being carried off by them, <i>that</i> the wisdom conveyed by them arises.</p>  
 <p>22. 'And in that age, <i>O</i> righteous <i>one of</i> the Spîtâmas! the coming of my desire is not purely for thee, nor is a thorough belief <i>of</i> the departure of life, so that the bringing <i>and</i> conducting of a speaker of promises (mit<i>r</i>agôv) is not necessary; those of the perfect apostate injure this discourse of thine, the Avesta and Zand, so that they shall make <i>it</i> thoroughly weak; <i>and</i> those of the perfect apostate harass their own souls, for love of the wealth which he produced.'</p>  
 <p>23. And about the ninth and tenth centuries this also it says, that, '<i>as</i> that age proceeds, this is what occurs, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! when many apostates utter the righteousness of priestly instruction and authority, <i>which</i> is wickedness towards me, they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence which is due to the manifestation of righteousness.'</p>  
 <p>24. Again Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of him thus: 'What do they so produce by that, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! when they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence due to the manifestation of righteousness?' 25. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'They so produce those <i>things</i> among them, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when they mention a greater reward for bantlings <i>and</i> relations than that of their own souls (that is, they talk more concerning their allowance, where it is that for their own). 26. Moreover, they give to the Kîgs <i>and</i> Karaps, for some repute <i>with</i> the shepherd people of the husbandman, and with the swift-horsed people <i>of</i> the warrior, as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>though they would provide us <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a> here <i>below</i> with a large share of meat, that they would make our privilege, just as we <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a> here supply him with meat whom we render greatly precious. 27. The property <i>of</i> even a wicked <i>man</i> here <i>below</i>, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! in the average opinion among the disorganized (anârâstânŏ) is a dignified provision (that is, we form a strong opinion, the approval <i>of which</i> is more to be asserted as <i>being</i> the opinion of a poor righteous <i>man</i>, about a worthy righteous <i>man</i> whose manifest righteousness is a homage (franâmi<i>s</i>nŏ) to duty <i>and</i> good works).'</p>  
 <p>28. Again he enquired of him thus: 'Is there so perfect a manifestation here <i>below</i>, in the age of the worldly existence of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers (that is, is there a lodgement of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers in any one)?' 29. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'It is so, among those men of mine <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! for here <i>below there</i> are priests who are eloquent, and they, too, are men voluble and requisite in the embodied existence, all-beneficent and producing the destruction <i>of</i> harm and the wizard; the people of the wicked tyrant say also regarding them, <i>that</i>, excepting thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! they rightly practise righteousness more largely, more powerfully, <i>and</i> more volubly. 30. Blind are those <i>of</i> the fiend, who are consulting with thee and are unaware of the tyrant; and observant are also those <i>of</i> the fiend who consult with them and think of <i>their</i> intelligence, and oppose the imbecile (anâkâsîh-aûmônd) apostate who is near them, so that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>they say <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">1</font></a> this, namely: "<i>As to</i> this which thou tellest us, <i>it</i> is evidently not so as thou sayest," of which they speak thus: "This duty of thy man is not mine (that is, it is not necessary for me to perform) nor thine (that is, it is not necessary even <i>for</i> thee to perform), because <i>it</i> is not this which is righteousness (that is, not a good work)." 31. For this <i>one</i> is produced for these words <i>and</i> thoughts of thine, <i>of</i> whom thou, too, art aware, he who is whatever is here <i>below</i> of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">2</font></a> of thoughtful controversy, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! for he brings into notice, through the intermingling of his own soul, <i>him</i> who is righteous, or has not become <i>so</i>.'</p>  
 <p>32. This, too, he says, namely: '<i>Of</i> those, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! who come in the ninth and tenth centuries, I tell thee that they are <i>of</i> the fiend <i>of</i> Greed (Âzî); it is in <i>her</i> womb that they are to be fashioned, they who assist those who would be vicious, through pre-eminence in leader-ship, or through excellence in subserviency.'</p>  
 <p>33. And this, too, it says about them: 'Those men are much to be destroyed;' so it is said by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> that 'these who are righteous, who carry away a corpse in this world, distress their fire, according to every high-priest <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and even long-flowing water; their bodies, which are really cesspools <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">4</font></a> of a terrible character, become very assisting for the tormentors whose corpses are grievously wicked. 34. Concerning them I tell thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the Spîtâmas! that, in the ninth and tenth centuries, <i>there</i> come those who are the brood of the fiend and the wound-producer (reshgâr) <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the evil spirit; even one of them is more to be destroyed than ten demon-worshippers <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">2</font></a>; they also produce extermination for these who are mine, for these of my religion, whom they, call a provision for destruction (that is, when it is possible to live in our way, and <i>ours</i> are wicked, they diminish in superiority). 35. Even the iniquity that they shall commit in leadership and subserviency, the sin which is smiting thee, they call a trifle (khalakŏ), <i>O</i> pure <i>one</i> of the Spîtâmas! and the smiter, they say, is <i>he</i> whom these of thy religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers smite. 36. Besides thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! they distress those <i>duties</i>, too, which <i>are</i> to be acquired <i>by</i> thy people (lagânŏ); they think scornfully of this ceremonial of thine, scornfully of <i>thy</i> worship, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! <i>and</i> they think scornfully of both the two blessed utterances <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the Avesta and Zand, which <i>were</i> proclaimed <i>to</i> thee <i>by</i> me who am the most propitious of spirits. 37. They foster villainous outrage, <i>and</i> they say the best work for mankind is immoderate fighting whose joyfulness is due to actions that are villainous; those, too, <i>that</i> they exterminate are the existences <i>due to</i> the spirits, they exterminate their own souls, they exterminate the embodied existences <i>of</i> the world; <i>and</i> they produce lamentation for the soul, and even the religion, as regards what is the mode of controlling orthodox people <i>together</i> with the iniquitous of the same period.'</p>  
 <p>38. And this, too, it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: 'So what <i>shall</i> we prescribe for those who are not capable, through <i>being</i> poor (that is, they have no means), nor have they troops, nor a protector over <i>them</i>, and they have many persecutors?' 39. <i>And</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'The strong-minded <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">1</font></a> man, through understanding, is a token of the development of those who, not being in the army, are capable; their persecutors also are many, and the passing over of authority is owing to the iniquitous of the same period.'</p>  
 <p>40. This, too, it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired thus: 'Is he, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who is a Kai <i>or</i> a Karap, or he who is a most evil ruler in authority, mingled again with the good?' 41. <i>And</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'Even he <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>42. Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>also</i> enquired thus: 'Is he, too, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who is <i>one of</i> those of the good sovereignty, mingled again with the good; or these, <i>such</i> as the Kaîsar and Khâkân <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">3</font></a>?' 43. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'Even that <i>former</i>, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t!'</p>  
 <p>44. About the same iniquitous <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">4</font></a> this, too, he says, namely: ‘When they are aware and understand about the sayings (galimakŏ) due to righteousness, they are pleased, so that a bribe seems better to them than duty and good works; they love the darkness <i>rather</i> than light, the existence they love</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the worst existence <i>rather</i> than the best existence, <i>and</i> they promote difficulty. 45. Concerning them, too, I tell thee that they are more to be destroyed than the leaping (shas<i>p</i>ŏ) serpent which is like a wolf <i>or</i> a lion, and they ever advance in malice <i>and</i> persecution from that <i>time</i> till when that man arrives who is Kitrô-mêhônŏ <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a> the righteous, with the victorious club. 46. He <i>has</i> marched with fifty triplets of men <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a> who are disciples, powerful and tall, looking after duties and ordinances, wide-shouldered, stout-armed, <i>and</i> very hairy (kabed-milîh), so that their appearance is rough and of a black colour <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a>, wherefore the demon and the iniquity <i>proceeding</i> from him fear them. 47. He also smites the evil spirit, <i>together</i> with <i>his</i> creatures; <i>and</i> those three manifest branches, that worship the fiend with simultaneous worship, are really these who march for eminent service on horses, even the Turkish demons with dishevelled hair; the Arab, and also She<i>d</i>âspô <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">4</font></a> the ecclesiastical Arûman.</p>

 <p>48. 'And he <i>has</i> then to attract men, contented and discontented, mostly through the incentive of duty; he who is not contented (that is, not agreeing with what he says) contentedly pays respect to him, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! (so that he brings him into the religion). 49. Likewise, through that club, he makes <i>one</i> press in the same manner; so that <i>one</i> is distressed by his hand to hold <i>others in</i> contempt, through the valiant arm and through the youthful bodily organs. 50. And he attaches power and triumph to his religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and through that power and triumph they become ever respected thenceforth, when those arrive who are the sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who shall pro-duce the renovation in an existence undecaying <i>and</i> immortal, hungerless and thirstless, the long-continued perpetuity including all.'</p>  
 <p>51. And about the separation (burînakŏ) of the ten centuries in the one millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> the tidings of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">1</font></a>, son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, it says also this, namely: 'When that century fully elapses which is the first of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, from <i>the time when</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t came forward to <i>his</i> conference, what is the separation of <i>this</i> first century?' 52. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <i>itself</i>' 53. 'What is the separation after the second, third, fourth, <i>fifth</i>, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, <i>or</i> tenth century?' 54. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <i>itself</i>.'</p>  
 <p>55. Then, when thirty winters of the tenth century are unelapsed (that is, thirty winters <i>are</i> remaining) a maiden, who is Shemig-abû <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">2</font></a>, walks up</p>

 <p>to the water; she that is the mother of that famous Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, and her former lineage is from Vohû-rô<i>k</i>ô-î Frahânyân <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the family of Îsa<i>d</i>vâstar, the son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>that</i> is brought forth by Arang. 56. Then she sits in that water <i>and</i> drinks it, and she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the third <i>of</i> the last that the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>was</i> dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer <i>of</i> Righteousness <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 57. Though <i>she</i> is fifteen years old, the girl (kanîg) <i>has</i> not before that associated with men <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">3</font></a>; nor afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, <i>has she done so</i> before the time when she gives birth.</p>  
 <p>58. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith (bâlistŏ) of the sky <i>for</i> the duration of ten days <i>and</i> ten nights, and it arrives again at that place where it <i>was</i> first appointed by allotment, where it occupies one finger<i>-breadth</i> out of the four finger<i>-breadths</i>, and it shines over all the regions which are seven. 59. So, too, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! of them themselves, their declaration is thus, that they know that the separation of the millennium, which this religion <i>has</i> heard about by listening, is thus; <i>and</i> of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.</p>  
 <p>60. Then, when that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers <i>and</i> good providers; <i>on</i> the morrow, in the daylight of the day, <i>it is</i> moreover manifest, when the <i>embodied</i> existence is thus undistressed—without</p>

 <p>a Kaî and without a Karap (that is, not deaf and blind to the affairs of the sacred beings), and is to be appropriated (that is, has not made its own self apart <i>from</i> the affairs of the sacred beings), and is produced full of life—that it has become extending (vâlân), and remains again great <i>in</i> various places in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> where the good Dâîti <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">1</font></a> is.</p>  
 <p>61. These are the characteristics as regards the two centuries which are the ninth and tenth; the accuracy of what <i>was</i> to come has continued <i>and</i> this has happened, and both are declared as regards the accuracy which is stated on evidence as to what <i>will</i> happen.</p>

VIII, xiv, 11, 12:—'<i>And</i> about the nature of the advancement of the people of the period, the separation <i>of</i> centuries and millenniums, <i>and</i> the signs, wonders, and perplexity which are manifested in the world at the end of each millennium in the world. Also as to the birth <i>and</i> arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the first millennium, and a report of him and his time, <i>and of</i> the many destroyers of the organizers of the period between Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium and the coming of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe4712.htm#fr_270">94:2</a> This meaning for vi<i>g</i>ârdŏ-vars is chiefly based upon the use of vi<i>g</i>âr<i>d</i> in AV. XXXIV, 5, for a woman's hair being 'combed.' These invaders of Irân from the east, at the end of the first millennium of the religion, are mentioned in Byt. II, 22, 24, 28; III, 1, 6, 13. They are called 'Turkish demons' in § 47.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="sbe4712.htm#fr_276">98:1</a> So far, this statement (§§ 11-16) seems to be ascribed to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; but what follows (§§ 17, 18, 20) appears to represent the sentiments of some Irânians of those later times.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe4712.htm#fr_292">104:1</a> So spelt here, but in Dk. IX, xli, 6, it is <i>K</i>itrag-mêhônŏ, and other slight variations occur in the best MSS. of Bd. XX, 7, 31; XXIX, 5; Byt. III, 25, 26; Dd. XC, 3; but they can all be traced to an, original <i>K</i>itrô-mêhan = Av. <i>K</i>ithrô-maêthanem, 'of the racial home,' a title applied both to the river and the immortal sacerdotal ruler of Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i>.
