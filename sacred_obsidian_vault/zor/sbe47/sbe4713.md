 <p>1. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, until the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh; and as to tidings of the same period.</p>  
 <p>2. The marvellousness of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar as to birth <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">2</font></a>, glory of person, sayings and actions; the standing of the sun ten days amid the sky <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">3</font></a>; the perishing of the fiend of the four-legged race; the production of a three-spring cloudless influence <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">4</font></a> for vegetation; the weakening of superfluity <i>and</i> destitution; the extreme strengthening of alliance; the gratification <i>due to</i> the good friendship of foreigners; the great increase of the wisdom of religion; and the praise</p>

 <p>of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar's smiting <i>with</i> a serpent-scourge of several kinds <i>in</i> the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.</p>  
 <p>3. The mightiness of the resources in the fifth century of the same millennium; the manifestation of the wizard Mahrkûs <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">1</font></a> for seven years, in the year which is reported in all the regions which are seven; the coming on <i>and</i> arrival of the winter of Mahrkûs, the perishing of most <i>of</i> mankind <i>and</i> animals within three winters and in the fourth, through the awfulness <i>of</i> those winters <i>and</i> the witchcraft of Mahrkûs; and the dying away of Mahrkûs of scanty progeny (ga<i>s</i>ûkŏ-zahi<i>s</i>nŏ), during the fourth winter, through the Dâhmân Âf<i>r</i>în <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 4. The opening of the enclosure made by Yim, the coming of mankind <i>and</i> animals therefrom, <i>and</i> the complete progress of mankind and animals again, arising specially from them.</p>  
 <p>5. After those winters, the abundant and great increase in the milk of cattle, and the abundant nourishment <i>of</i> mankind by milk; the less distress of body <i>in</i> cattle, the fullness and prosperity <i>of</i> the world, the celebrity of assembled mankind, <i>and</i> the great increase of liberality. 6. Also the feebleness</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>of</i> poverty among mankind, <i>just</i> like what revelation mentions thus: 'Even so he, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! though he be more unfortunate than he who is accepting <i>from him</i>, is like the creator whose bounty of permanent liberality does thus, in the embodied existence, remain in his dwelling.'</p>  
 <p>7. And this, too, it says, namely: ‘When that winter passes away, <i>of</i> which <i>it is</i> said that <i>it is</i> boisterous and destructive <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then a wild beast, black and wide-travelling, walks up to the. Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, and thus it thinks, that they <i>who</i> worship Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a <i>will</i> therefore not finally hate us more than him who is their own progeny, the son whom they thus bring up <i>as</i> a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper here <i>below, in</i> fondness <i>and</i> freedom from malice towards well-yielding cattle.</p>  
 <p>8. ‘Then Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô calls out to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers from the upper region, <i>and</i> thus he speaks: “You are for the worship of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a; let no one <i>of you</i> become such a slaughterer of cattle as the slaughterers you have been before. 9. Recommend increase in gifts, recommend neighbourliness in person; are you worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a? do you slaughter cattle? do you slaughter those of them which give you assistance, which speak to you thus: 'On account of your helpfulness <i>one</i> tells you that you are worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a <i>and</i> you <i>may</i> eat?' I <i>am</i> in neighbourliness before that, until <i>the time</i> when you exclaim: 'Mine <i>are</i> the serpent and toad.'</p>  
 <p>10. ‘“And you recommend increase, you recommend neighbourliness, <i>and</i> the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, even those of them who give them</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>assistance, so that you are worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a <i>and</i> you eat; I <i>am</i> in neighbourliness before that, until <i>the time</i> when you exclaim: 'Mine <i>are</i> the serpent <i>and</i> toad.'</p>  
 <p>11. '"Contentedly the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, contentedly the cattle of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers let <i>them</i> butcher <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and contented are the cattle when they do not butcher <i>them;</i> contentedly the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers eat cattle, <i>and</i> contented <i>are the cattle</i> when they eat them. 12. And then, when <i>there</i> are spirits, the slaughterers and whatever they slaughter, the butchers and whatever they butcher, <i>and</i> the eaters and whatever they eat <i>are</i> alike watched <i>by them</i>."'</p>  
 <p>13. And this, too, it says, namely: 'When that century fully elapses, which is the fifth in the second millennium as regards the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, then of all those who <i>are</i> upon the earth, the existences which are both wicked and righteous, two-thirds <i>in</i> the land of Irân are righteous and one-<i>third</i> wicked; and so likewise the Tûrânians <i>and</i> those who <i>are</i> around Irân remain non-Irânian around Irân; the chief increase in dwellings here <i>below</i>, of those in the embodied existence, remains <i>just</i> as now.'</p>  
 <p>14. And this, too, it says, namely: 'When that millennium <i>has</i> fully elapsed, which is the first of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, what is the separation after the first century?' 15. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <i>itself</i>.' 16. 'And what is the separation after the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, <i>or</i> tenth</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>century?' 17. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <i>itself</i>.'</p>  
 <p>18. Then, when thirty winters of the tenth century <i>are</i> unelapsed (arânako), a maiden, who is Shapîr-abû <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">1</font></a>, walks up to the water; <i>she</i> that is the mother of that good Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and her former lineage is from Vôhû-rô<i>k</i>ô-î Frahânyân <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the family of Îsa<i>d</i>vâstar, the son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>that</i> is brought forth by Aran<i>g</i>: 19. Then she sits in that water <i>and</i> drinks <i>it, and</i> she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the second <i>of</i> the last that the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>was</i> dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer <i>of</i> Worship <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">4</font></a> (that is, he augments liberality). 20. Though fifteen years old, the damsel (zihânakŏ) <i>has</i> not before that associated with men; nor yet afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, <i>has she done so</i> before the time when she gives birth <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>21. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith of the sky <i>for</i> the duration of twenty days <i>and</i> nights <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">6</font></a>, <i>and</i> it shines over all the regions which are seven. 22. So, too, the declaration of them themselves is that they know</p>

 <p>that the separation of the millennium, which this religion <i>has</i> heard about by listening, is even thus; <i>and</i> of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.</p>  
 <p>23. When that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers <i>and</i> good providers; <i>on</i> the morrow, in the daylight of the day, <i>it is</i> moreover manifest, when the embodied existence is <i>thus</i> undistressed—without a Kai and without a Karap (that is, not blind <i>and</i> not deaf to the affairs of the sacred beings), and is to be appropriated (that is, has not made its own self apart <i>from</i> the affairs of the sacred beings), and is produced full of life—that it has become extending, and is again great <i>in</i> various places in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> where the good Dâîtî <i>is</i>.</p>

II, 49 (Sp.) the evil winter which was foretold to Yim is called the winter of Markûs. In later times this name has been understood as Heb. Malkôs, 'autumnal rain;' so the idea of the fatal freezing winter of Mahrkûs, the intender of death, was abandoned for that of the deluging rain of Malkôs, as in Mkh. XXVII, 28. In Dd. XXXVII, 94, both snow and rain are mentioned as produced by Mahrkûs or Markûs (as it is always written in Pahlavi), and in Sd. IX, 5 only his name is stated.
