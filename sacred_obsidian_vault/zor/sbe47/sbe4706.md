 <p>1. About the marvellousness of the manifestations before <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">1</font></a> the birth of that most auspicious of offsprings from <i>his</i> mother <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is declared, that the creator passed on that glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the material existences of the creatures <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">3</font></a> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; when the command arose from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the coming of that glory from the spiritual <i>existence</i> to the worldly, and <i>to</i> the material substance (mâ<i>d</i>îyâtŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is manifested <i>as</i> a great wonder to the multitude (va<i>l</i> kabedânŏ). 3. <i>Just</i> as revelation mentions <i>it</i> thus: 'Thereupon, when Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> had produced the material (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the glory then, in the</p>

 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, fled on <i>towards</i> the material of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on to that germ; from that germ it fled on, on <i>to the light which is endless</i> <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a>; from the light which is endless <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">2</font></a> it fled on, on to that of the sun; from that of the sun it fled on, on <i>to</i> the moon; from that moon it fled on, on to those stars; from those stars it fled on, on to the fire which <i>was</i> in the house of Zôî<i>s</i> <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <i>and</i> from that fire it fled on, on to the wife of Frâhîmrva<i>n</i>ã-zôi<i>s</i> <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">4</font></a>, when she brought forth that girl who became the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.'</p>  
 <p>4. Of that splendour, escaped at the same time into the earth <i>and</i> into the sky, the father-in-law's ignorance is declared, so that it is said by those in the village of the more instructed and invoking Zôî<i>s</i> <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">5</font></a>, as to the self-combustion <i>which</i> burns the fire, that fuel is not necessary for its use. 5. Then they went on to the governor (kê<i>d</i>ŏ), and he explained <i>to</i> them concerning that same (that is, he spoke to them) thus: 'The full glory of embodied existence</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the glory of life <i>apart</i> from the body, so that all diligence devoid of this is only movement.'</p>  
 <p>6. And <i>it is</i> declared that the demons, on account of their defeat by that glory in maintaining <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">1</font></a> adversity for the girl, <i>were</i> bringing on to that district three armaments (hênô), winter, the demon of pestilence, and oppressive enemies; and <i>a suspicion was</i> cast by them into the minds of those of the district, that this harm happened to the district owing to the witchcraft of this girl; so that those of the district quarreled dreadfully with the parents, as to the witchcraft of antagonism <i>in</i> the girl, and about putting <i>her</i> out from that district.</p>  
 <p>7. And the father of that girl spoke even these <i>words</i> to those of the district, with much reason, about the unjust assertion of witchcraft relative to the girl, that is: 'When this girl <i>was</i> brought forth among those of mine, her whole destiny (vakhsh) was afterwards set forth <i>by</i> that manifest radiance of fire, where it brought out radiance from all over her in the dark night. 8. When this girl sits in the interior of the house, wherein there is no fire, <i>and</i> in the chamber (sarâî) of fire they increase <i>its</i> intensity (bûr<i>z</i>ŏ), it is lighter there, where <i>and</i> when this girl sits, than there where they increase the intensity of the fire; <i>one</i> is dazzled by the radiance from her body, <i>and</i> that of a wizard <i>would</i> not <i>have</i> been so glorious.'</p>  
 <p>9. Even then, owing to the influence (sârîni<i>s</i>nŏ) of the demons, and the Kavîg and Karap <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>district, they did not become satisfied; <i>so</i> the father ordered the girl to go to Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the father of a family in the country (matâ) of the Spîtâmas, in the district (rû<i>d</i>astâk) of Alâk; and the girl obeyed the command of <i>her</i> father. 10. That disturbance which the demons caused, with evil intention, for the expatriation of that girl, the sacred beings assiduously made the reason for the coming of the girl for marriage to Pôrûshâspô, the father of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through <i>her</i> father sending the girl to the dwelling of Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô, the father of Pôrûshâspô.</p>  
 <p>11. One <i>marvel</i> <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a> is this which is declared, that when that girl, in going to that family, stood on the loftiest place in the country of the Spîtâmas, and <i>it</i> is surveyed by her, a great wonder is manifested to the girl, <i>just</i> as revelation mentions: 'It is their <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>  
 <p>voice is carried away to her from them; "do thou proceed to that village which is theirs; it is very depressed in height and very wide in breadth, in which he who is living and the cattle mostly walk together; besides, for thy assistance that village is divinely fashioned <i>and</i> compassionate."' 12. Thereupon that damsel stopped, and also fully observed that <i>their</i> recital seems <i>to be</i> for the conveyance of this statement, that my action <i>should be</i> such as <i>was</i> ordered me <i>by</i> my father also. 13. Then that damsel thoroughly washed <i>her</i> hands, and proceeded from them to that village which was Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô's, and the glory came to Pôrûshâspô, the son of Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô.</p>  
 <p>14. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is declared, that the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> passed on the guardian spirit (fravâhar) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to the parents of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through (le-<i>k</i>adôn) Hôm <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a>, by a marvel produced by cultivation. 15. Again, too, revelation says that, when the separation (burînŏ) of the third millennium occurred, at the end of the 3,000 years of spiritual existence without a destroyer, (after the creatures <i>were</i> in spiritual existence, <i>and</i> before the arrival of the fiend); then the archangels framed Zaratû<i>s</i>t together, <i>and</i> they seated the guardian spirit within, having a mouth, having a tongue, and the proclaimer <i>of</i> the celestial mansions.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. Then the three millenniums of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>were</i> the number manifest to them through observation by the eye, <i>and</i> it seemed that he became just like an archangel through bodily contact with (hamkerpîh) <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">2</font></a> the archangels. 17. And when the separation of the third millennium occurred, after the framing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t together, and before the conveying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t down to the worldly <i>state</i>, at the end of the 3,000 years <i>of</i> worldly existence with a destroyer, then Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> argued with Vohûmanô <i>and</i> Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">3</font></a> thus: 'Is his mother beheld by you, so that we may produce Zaratû<i>s</i>t?'</p>  
 <p>18. And Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô spoke <i>in</i> reply thus: 'Thou art aware even of that, O propitious <i>one!</i> about the Zaratû<i>s</i>t we <i>shall</i> produce, <i>and</i> thou and we have produced, thou knowest, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! <i>and to us</i> who are the other archangels do thou announce the place, because its appearance thou knowest, <i>thou</i> propitious spirit Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>!'</p>  
 <p>19. Then Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> argued with Vohûmanô and the reminding by A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">4</font></a>, Shatraver, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>, <i>and</i> Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">5</font></a>, <i>saying:</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'The conveying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t down does not seem <i>to be for</i> me, because, having a mouth <i>and</i> having a tongue, <i>he will be</i> a proclaimer to the world of embodied beings. 20. If we convey Zaratû<i>s</i>t down on to the world of embodied beings, having a mouth <i>and</i> having a tongue, <i>as</i> a proclaimer <i>of</i> the celestial mansion, this is evident: they <i>will</i> say, concerning the origin <i>of</i> him who is my righteous man, <i>that</i> we frame him together with the water, with the land, with the plants, <i>and</i> with the animals <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 21. Therefore we <i>will</i> carry off there, to the village of Pôrûshâspô, him whom they <i>will</i> call Zaratû<i>s</i>t of good lineage of both natures, both <i>of</i> Nêryôsang <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">2</font></a> who is of the archangels, and <i>of</i> Yim who is of mankind.'</p>  
 <p>22. Then the archangels framed together a stem of Hôm the height of a man, excellent in colour, <i>and</i> juicy where fresh; also to carry off the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to that stem of theirs, the archangels made it go forth thither from that endless light, and gave it up there also to the instinctive intellect (âsnô vîr). 23. Likewise their carrying off <i>was</i> manifest around, and a wall <i>was</i> openly displayed round them, but a restless one; the Hôm <i>was</i> constantly provided with a mouth, where it was suitable, <i>and</i> sap constantly oozed from the Hôm where it was moist.</p>  
 <p>24. And when thirty <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">3</font></a> years of the 3,000 years of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>well-disturbed <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">1</font></a> worldly existence remained, Vohûmanô and Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô then associated their pre-eminence together, <i>and</i> turned off into the embodied existence; there they came up to where two birds had settled in quest of progeny, <i>and</i> seven years before the serpents devoured the inexperienced progeny. 25. For their <i>own</i> designs, Vohûmanô <i>and</i> Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô went on, and those birds consulted <i>them</i> thus: 'We have to offer homage, and our want is that Hôm.'</p>  
 <p>26. The circumstances of those associated together in pre-eminence and the request of these <i>for</i> that Hôm <i>were</i> a double marvel; Vohûmanô seized one of those <i>birds</i> by both legs, and the other <i>by</i> one; he also brought them that Hôm, and gave it up to them there, on that tree within <i>their</i> nest. 27. And they uncovered above the serpents, that have gone up to the progeny of the birds; then that guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t started up, and the serpents on the tree rushed also from them away towards the demons; <i>but</i> that guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t smote them on the jaws, <i>and</i> the serpents fell down <i>and</i> expired, which <i>events</i> have also occurred among them till now, <i>having</i> been requisite as regards a depriver of life (<i>g</i>ân-gîr) and <i>any</i> one of that species. 28. And that Hôm <i>was</i> connected with that tree; and on the summit of that tree, there</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>where the nest of the birds was, it grew constantly fresh and golden-coloured <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>29. After the coming of her who bore Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to Pôrûshâspô for marriage, Vohûmanô <i>and</i> A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô, thus associated together in their pre-eminence, came up there to Pôrûshâspô in the cattle-pasture of the Spîtâmas, and their thoughts <i>were</i> confined to that Hôm brought by them. 30. Then Pôrûshâspô walked forth, with spiritual desire, up to the water of the Dâît <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">2</font></a>, because the requirement of the spirits is the spiritual knowledge <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">3</font></a> that spirits are ever-beneficial; and that Hôm <i>was</i> also seen by him, when it had grown on that tree, on the inside of the nest. 31. Then Pôrûshâspô thought thus: 'It is for me, really (madam-<i>î</i><i>k</i>-am) to proceed and, even as <i>there</i> is no reaching by me up to that Hôm, that tree must be cut down, for apart from that, <i>O</i> Hôm of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! thou seemest fresh, so that the benefit of something from thee <i>will be</i> advantageous.'</p>  
 <p>32. Then Pôrûshâspô walked on and washed their clothes acquiescently (patâsîg), and here a great wonder was manifest to Pôrûshâspô. 33. About this it says that, all the while that Pôrûshâspô washed their clothes, Vohûmanô then proceeded from the uppermost third of the tree unto the middle of it, whereon <i>it was</i> the desire of Pôrûshâspô</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>to be conveyed. 34. Then Pôrûshâspô, <i>having</i> washed the clothes, walked up to it and, thereupon gathering up the whole of that <i>Hôm</i>, all of it <i>was</i> then also appropriated by him through assistance like that of that <i>archangel, just</i> as what thou offerest for the food-sustenance of a friend's son of two years <i>or</i> three years <i>of age;</i> and it seemed to him that <i>archangel's</i> joyful payment.</p>  
 <p>35. Carrying off their Hôm, Pôrûshâspô spoke of it to <i>his</i> noble (mas) wife thus: 'So thou, <i>O</i> Dûk<i>d</i>âûb! shouldst keep their Hôm in custody, all the while that their Hôm fulfils duty and routine.'</p>  
 <p>36. One <i>marvel</i> is this <i>which is</i> declared, that the coming of the nature (gôhar) of the body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through water <i>and</i> vegetation, to the bodies of <i>his</i> parents, is manifested <i>as</i> a great wonder of the creator to the multitude. 37. As revelation mentions <i>it thus:</i> 'Thereupon, when Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> had produced the material (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the nature of <i>his</i> body then, in the presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, fled on <i>towards</i> the material of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.'</p>  
 <p>38. About Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Mû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">2</font></a> bringing the cloud-water down in a compassionate manner ever anew, drop by drop, <i>and</i> completely warm, for the delight of sheep and men, <i>and—with</i> as much seed as the roving of two rampant bulls <i>would</i> thereby <i>cast</i> upon the plants <i>which</i> have grown, all of every species—<i>they are</i> casting <i>it</i> upon those other plants at that time, even upon the dry <i>ones</i>; and the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t came from that water to those plants.</p>  
 <p>39. One <i>marvel</i> is this <i>which is</i> declared, that, in order that the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t shall come unto <i>his</i> parents, after <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a> the mounting of the archangels Pôrûshâspô drives six white cows, with yellow ears, up to those plants. 40. And here is manifested a great wonder, <i>such</i> as revelation mentions thus: Two <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a> of those cows, unimpregnated, <i>had</i> become full of milk, and the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t came from the plants to those cows, and is mingled with the cows' milk; it is owing thereto <i>that</i> Pôrûshâspô drove those cows back. 41. And Pôrûshâspô spoke to Dûk<i>d</i>âûb thus: '<i>O</i> Dûk<i>d</i>âûb! in two of those cows, <i>which are</i> unimpregnated <i>and have</i> not calved, milk <i>has</i> appeared; do thou milk those cows, which are the splendour <i>and</i> glory of the cows <i>and of</i> any embodied existence whatever.' 42. And Dûk<i>d</i>âûb arose and, taking that pail of hers which had a four-fold capacity, she also milked from them the milk which <i>was</i> in them, and a great <i>part</i> of what they gave up to her she had to throw away; and the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in that milk.</p>  
 <p>43. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is manifested in the struggle of the adversary for concealing and spoiling that milk, <i>just</i> as revelation mentions thus: Thereupon, at that time, the demons formed <i>themselves</i> into an assembly, and the demon of demons growled thus: 'You demons become quite unobservant: that food is really supplied fresh, so that the formation is settled which <i>will</i> extend as far as to that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>man who <i>will be</i> the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t; which of you <i>will</i> undertake his destruction, all the while that he exists for mankind, so as to make <i>him</i> more contemptibly impotent?' 44. <i>K</i>êshmak <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">1</font></a>, astute in evil, growled thus: 'I <i>will</i> undertake his destruction.' 45. Astute in evil, he rushed away with thrice fifty <i>of</i> the demons who are Karaps of <i>K</i>êshmak; and that village <i>was</i> partly uprooted and partly destroyed <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">2</font></a> by him, fellow-workers <i>were</i> ruined, and the number of fellow-eaters of broken victuals, attending the great, <i>was</i> not broken up, among whom was he that had repelled his authority.</p>  
 <p>46. <i>It is</i> declared that, afterwards, Pôrûshâspô asked again <i>for</i> that Hôm from Dûk<i>d</i>âûb, and he pounded it, and with that cows' milk <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">3</font></a>, into which the nature of the body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t had come, he here mingled the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and the nature of the body came at once into union with it.</p>  
 <p>47. One <i>marvel</i> is this <i>which is</i> declared, that Pôrûshâspô <i>and</i> Dûk<i>d</i>âûb drank up that Hôm and milk, when they were mingled together and announced to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and here occurred a combination of the glory, guardian spirit, and bodily nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t into a man<i>child</i>. 48. And a great wonder is manifested to both of them, through that which revelation mentions thus: Thereupon, both have embraced the first <i>time</i> <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">4</font></a> with desire</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>for a son, <i>and</i> the demons shouted out unto them, in the villainous speech <i>of</i> sinfulness, thus: 'Why shouldst thou act like this, vile <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">1</font></a> Pôrûshâspô?' whereupon they started up like people who <i>are</i> ashamed. 49. A second <i>time</i> they have embraced, and the demons shouted out unto them, in villainous speech; whereupon they started up like people who <i>are</i> ashamed. 50. A third <i>time</i> they have embraced thus, with desire for a son; and the demons shouted out unto them, in villainous speech; whereupon they started up like people who <i>are</i> ashamed. 51. And they spoke with one another about <i>it, and</i> continued at this duty, and accomplished it <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>saying</i>: 'We will not so stop without accomplishing something, not <i>even</i> though both Râk and Nô<i>d</i>ar <i>should</i> arrive here together <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' 52. Then that man<i>child</i> who <i>was</i> the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t became complete, and here <i>below there</i> came together the nature of the body, the guardian spirit, and the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the womb <i>of his</i> mother.</p>  
 <p>53. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is declared, that, after the combination of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the womb <i>of his</i> mother, the demons strove anew wonderfully</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>  
 <p>to cause the death of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in <i>his</i> mother's womb, and she who bore him <i>was</i> rendered sickly by them through the sharpest of sharp and afflictive pain, until she wished to ask the wizard physicians for a desirable remedy. 54. And here is manifested a great wonder, just as revelation says: 'It is then a voice of theirs is carried away there to her from the higher region, from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and from the archangels, thus: "Thou damsel who goest! do not proceed thither, because anything <i>of</i> theirs is destruction through wizard medical treatment; <i>for</i> healthfulness wash <i>thy</i> hands thoroughly, <i>and</i> those hands shall take firewood, and upon it thou shalt offer meat for the sake of the infant, thou shalt offer up cows' butter <i>to</i> the fire for his sake; thou shalt likewise heat <i>it</i> at the fire for his sake, and shalt quaff (pâîmês) <i>it</i> off at the <i>proper</i> time for his sake, and thou <i>wilt</i> become well."' 55. Then at once that damsel washed <i>her</i> hands thoroughly, and she did just as <i>she had</i> heard, and became well <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>56. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is manifested to the multitude when three days remained to his coming <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>forth</i>; in the manner of the sun, at the approach of <i>its</i> uprising, when its first advancing twilight is diffused, <i>his</i> body is then announced as revelation says: 'It is then when in those last three nights during which Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in the womb, where he still subsisted three days till afterwards born, <i>that</i> the village of Pôrûshâspô became all luminous. 57. Then spoke the horse-owners and cattle-owners of the Spîtâmas, in running away, thus: "It is requisite <i>to be</i> forgiven <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">3</font></a>; the village of Pôrûshâspô, on which</p>

 <p>that fire <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a> is in every crevice, is disturbed by confusion <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">2</font></a>." 58. Then, on running together again, they said: "It is not fully forgiven for the village of Pôrûshâspô; fire is on it in every crevice <i>and</i> it is disturbed by confusion; unto him is born, at his house, a brilliant man<i>child</i>."'</p>  
 <p>59. This, too, is one of the wonders, when the report of the marvellousness of the birth <i>of</i> that man<i>child</i> <i>and of his</i> great glory, is due to statements of Yim and also others, brilliant in carrying on the destiny which had entered them from the sacred beings. 60. Wherein Yim spoke to the demons thus: 'Here <i>below</i> the pure <i>and</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>will</i> be born, who <i>will</i> produce for you who are demons that absence of intercession which is prepared for you (that is, he <i>will</i> produce for you a thoroughly-harassed actual inactivity, an absence of intercession so that you are not able to pray on your own account, <i>and</i> no one prays for you).'</p>  
 <p>61. <i>It is</i> declared that the report about the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and concerning his prophesying, is explained (avazandî-hastŏ) only by the illustrious, <i>such</i> as Yim and Frê<i>d</i>ûn <i>and</i> many learned people; but the sacred beings are also heard through the tongues of the animals scattered in the world, in order that even that witness shall arise as regards his prophesying. 62. <i>Just</i> like that which is declared, that in the reign of Kaî-Ûs <i>there</i> was an ox, and a splendour had come to his body from the sacred beings; and whenever a dispute as to the frontier arose between Irân and Tûrân, that ox <i>was</i> brought, and the boundary between Irân and Tûrân</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>was</i> truly shown by him. 63. And because, when an Irânian <i>had</i> to seek a decision as to a Tûrânian in a dispute <i>and</i> lies occurred, the Tûrânians were constantly convicted through the showing of the boundary <i>by</i> the ox, and happened to be defeated by the Irânians—<i>and</i>, besides that, their envy also <i>arose</i> as to Kaî-Ûs, even of <i>his</i> ownership—therefore, on account of <i>his</i> possession of that wonder, the Tûrânians proceeded about the smiting and destruction of that ox, and through their sorcery and witchcraft the mind of Kaî-Ûs <i>was</i> disturbed about that ox, and he went to a warrior, <i>whose</i> name <i>was</i> Srîtô <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> ordered him to kill that ox; <i>so</i> that man came to smite the ox. 64. And here is manifested a wonder of importance by that ox, <i>such</i> as revelation mentions thus: 'To him spoke the ox, in grave words, thus: "Thou shouldst not murder me, <i>O</i> Sritô! thou seventh <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">2</font></a> of those of this race; you <i>will</i> atone <i>for this</i> malice when Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the most desirous of righteousness among the existences, arrives and proclaims thy bad action in revelation; and the distress in thy soul becomes such as is declared by that passage where <i>it says:</i> 'As death occurs to him, that of Va<i>d</i>ak <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the like occurs.'"' 65. <i>It</i> is declared that that man, when this wonder <i>was</i> thus seen by him <i>proceeding</i> from the ox, did not kill <i>it</i>, but went back to Kaî-Ûs <i>and</i> told <i>him</i> what he <i>had</i> seen. 66. Kaî-Ûs then still, on account of the amazing deceitfulness of the demons and wizards, ordered the same man to smite that ox</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>and that man proceeded also again to the ox, <i>and</i> though <i>it was</i> carrying <i>on</i> still much <i>of</i> that talk, he did not lend an ear to <i>it, but</i> killed <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>67. Regarding the sole-created ox <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">1</font></a>, too, <i>it</i> is declared that, <i>on</i> meeting its destruction by the evil spirit, it bellowed thus: 'Though thou thinkest it as to us, <i>O</i> evil spirit, astute in evil! that thou art <i>in</i> every way a winner by destruction, <i>it is</i> not to our destruction thou art even then an attainer <i>in</i> every way (that is, <i>it</i> is not possible for thee so to annihilate that we <i>shall</i> not arise again); even now I proclaim that that man, Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, <i>will</i> arrive in that last revolution, who <i>will</i> produce distress for the demons, the assistants of the demon, and also the wicked who are bipeds.'</p>  
 <p>68. Likewise the marvellousness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's defeat of the demons, owing to his glory and by means of his sagacity, even before he had come into the world by birth; when Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i>  <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">2</font></a> the wizard is amazingly distressed through seeking that glory of his by desire of the demons, just as revelation <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">3</font></a> mentions thus: 'Thereupon Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i>, the very powerful Tûrânian, rushed away, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! to the wide-formed ocean a first, a second, and a third time; and he wished to obtain that glory which is specially for those <i>of</i> the countries of Irân, <i>for</i> the born and the unborn, and which is <i>for</i> the righteous <i>one; but</i> he did not attain to that glory.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_74"></a><a href="sbe4706.htm#fr_74">19:2</a> The Karaps were apparently idolatrous priests, especially those before the conversion of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp by Zaratû<i>s</i>t; one being called 'a wizard' in Chap. III, 5, 42-44, another 'unsanctified' in IV, 24, <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> a third is 'deadly' in IV, 67, and a demon himself is a Karap in IV, 61, and has Karaps under his control in II, 45. The following Karaps are named in the time of Zaratû<i>s</i>t:—Dûrâsrôbô mentioned in Chap. III, 4-41; Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh in III, 20-34, who is called a Tûrânian in III, 28; Vaêdvôi<i>s</i>t in IV, 21-24; and Zâk in IV, 67. Some others are named by other writers. The Kavîgs, Kaîs, or Kîgs are mentioned with the Karaps in Chaps. II, 9; III, 50; IV, 2, 6, 14, 64, 67; VIII, 26, 40, as equally objectionable, but their avocation as officials is not defined. Both classes seem to have held official rank, but whether their titles were tribal or official is uncertain. The Avesta calls them Karapan and Kavi; the latter word being also the royal title of the Kayân dynasty, of which Vi<i>s</i>tâsp was a member. Compare Zs. XV, 1-4; XXIII, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_75"></a><a href="sbe4706.htm#fr_75">20:1</a> So also in §§ 13, 70. In Bd. XXXII, 1, 2, the two old MSS. of the Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i> have Padtarâsp thrice and Pîrtarâsp once; K 20 has Spîtarsp and Paitiresp; K 20 b has Padirtarâspô and Paitirispô; and M6 has Padirtarâsp and Paitiresp. Zs. XIII, 6, has Purtarâspô.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_77"></a><a href="sbe4706.htm#fr_77">20:3</a> Probably we should read: 'It is the voice of those sacred beings' who are mentioned in § 10. As the word ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân, 'sacred beings,' is exactly similar, in Pahlavi, to shân (in val<i>â</i>shân, 'their' <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a> or 'those'), a copyist would be liable to the blunder of leaving out the final word in writing val<i>â</i>shân ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân. Or the original writer himself may not have quoted enough of the text he was reading, to make his meaning clear.</p>

When a Parsi speaks of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as the first of the Ameshaspends, or archangels, he does not put him on an equality with the rest, any more than we put a commander-in-chief on an equality with his troops when we call him a good soldier.</p>
