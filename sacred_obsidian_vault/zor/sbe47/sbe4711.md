 <p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested after <i>the time of</i> Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the collapse (han<i>g</i>aftanŏ) <i>of</i> the sovereignty of Iran.</p>  
 <p>2. There is marvellousness <i>which</i> is manifested after Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, apart from the blessedness of ordeal, the accomplishment of other Avestic rites, the great power over the sacred fires, <i>and</i> many other religious observances <i>which</i> were connected with the disciples of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>3. Even after the devastation which happened owing to Alexander, those who <i>were</i> rulers after him brought back much to the collection from a scattered state <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>and</i> there are <i>some</i> who <i>have</i> ordered the keeping <i>of it</i> in the treasury of Shapân <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. Likewise there is to be brought <i>forward</i> what <i>there is</i> concerning the names of rulers <i>and</i> high-priests, <i>such</i> as arrive for it at times <i>and</i> periods, which <i>are</i> each consecutive, as organizers <i>of</i> the religion and the world; also of the tyrant <i>or</i> apostate, who is manifest at various periods, for the disturbance of the religion <i>and</i> monarchy and the penance of the world, <i>with</i> the coming of the penitential <i>one</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. <i>Such</i> as Vohûmanô, son <i>of</i> Spend-ad <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of the rulers, about whom it says even this in the Avesta, that <i>he is</i> Vohûmanô, the just, who is the most efficient of the assembly of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 6. And <i>S</i>ênôv <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the high-priests, as about him it says even this: 'The religion becomes a hundred years <i>old</i> when <i>S</i>ênôv is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also the first Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper <i>with</i> a life of a hundred <i>years</i>, <i>and</i> who walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.'</p>  
 <p>7. Also Alexander of the devastators, as it says even this of him in revelation <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">3</font></a>, that <i>in</i> those three winters, which <i>are</i> of like purpose (ham-ay<i>â</i><i>z</i>akŏ), that Aeshm <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">4</font></a> would set up a deadly king in the impenitent world, who is the evil-destined Alexander.</p>  
 <p>8. And of the high-priests <i>are</i> Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the interpretation of whose name is 'the pure word;' Srûtvôk-spâ<i>d</i>âk <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the interpretation of whose name is 'the propitious recitation;' Zrayang,h<i>a</i>u <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the interpretation of whose name is 'the ocean existence' and Spe<i>n</i>tô-khratv<i>a</i>u <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the interpretation of</p>

 <p>whose name is 'the propitious wisdom.' 9. Because it says even this about them, namely: 'I mention thy manifestation, <i>and</i> also the tokens of its publicity when this religion of thy Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers becomes four hundred years <i>old</i> <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">1</font></a>; in this law benightedness (lêlyâîh) arises, <i>and</i> the embodied existences see the manifestation through calculation <i>of</i> the planets and also the stars; and whoever, too, <i>are</i> mine are <i>so</i> for a century, through the average opinion <i>of</i> thirty medium winters for a man <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <i>and</i> the righteous Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk and those three others are they of the most righteous existences, over whom they <i>are</i> the most masterly <i>and</i> most authoritative in that time.' to. And this, too, that they who glorify the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers in the fifth and sixth centuries are they; <i>and</i> no persons save <i>their</i> souls, except <i>those</i> who remain for the arrival of the four <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">3</font></a> interpretations that <i>arise</i> through the authority of these four individuals, Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk, Srûtô-spâdh<i>a</i>u <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">4</font></a>, Zrayang,h<i>a</i>u, <i>and</i> Spe<i>n</i>tô-khratv<i>a</i>u who, all four of them, seek <i>their</i> thoughts, words, <i>and</i> deeds in the <i>sacred</i> text (mânsar).</p>  
 <p>11. Also Rashn-rêsh <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">5</font></a> is the apostate of that</p>

 <p>time, as <i>some one</i> <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">1</font></a> says unto Rashn, <i>one</i> of the sacred beings, and about many besides this <i>one</i>, thus: 'All who are creatures of the beneficent spirit are distressed by their persecution, <i>but</i> put trust in those men, Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk <i>and</i> those three others.'</p>  
 <p>12. And of the organizers of the period is Artakhshatar <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">2</font></a>, son of Pâpak, as it says even this about him, namely: 'Which is that ruler who is powerful, more striving than the Kayâns, <i>and</i> mighty, an embodiment of the <i>sacred</i> commandments and awfully armed <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">3</font></a>; in whose abode Aharî<i>s</i>vang <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the virtuous <i>and</i> radiant, walks forth in maiden form, beneficent and very strong, well-formed, high-girded, and truthful, of illustrious race <i>and</i> noble? 13. Whoever it is that, on the occurrence of strife, seeks prosperity for <i>him</i>self with his own arm; who-ever it is that, on the occurrence of strife, encounters the enemies with his own arm.'</p>  
 <p>14. Tanvasar <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">5</font></a> is also for his assistance, as it says</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>this, too, about them: 'Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked again thus: "Who is he who is the most salutary <i>for</i> a country, which the demons <i>have</i> exhausted of everything virtuous, over which his authority is brought and <i>which</i> is wicked and teaching falsehood?" 15. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "An autocrat (sâstâr), to cure a country, who <i>has</i> not gone <i>mad</i> (that is, he does not annoy the good) and is well-directing (that is, he gives virtuous commands), who is <i>also</i> of noble race, and likewise a priest who is acquainted with war, of a famous province, <i>and</i> righteous, are most salutary <i>for</i> that country. 16. And I tell thee this, that the apostasy of destruction is <i>just</i> like the four-legged wolf which the world gives up to running astray (var<i>d</i>ak-takhshi<i>s</i>nîh) (that is, owing to its action <i>they are</i> leading <i>it</i> off as astray; which is so that even he who is not opulent is rendered sickly, that they (<i>the apostates</i>) may take away his things by the hand of the assassin (khûnyân); and they shall lead the world, the dwelling for <i>his</i> residence, into wandering. 17. But that wicked (<i>a</i><i>v</i>ârûnŏ) strife descended upon that country, besides that wicked demon-worship, besides that wicked slander; and not even that wicked strife, nor that wicked demon-worship, nor that wicked slander, is dissipated from</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>that country until <i>the time</i> when they attach the grant of approval to him, the spiritual leader, the eloquent (pûr-gûftâr), truthful-speaking, <i>and</i> righteous Tanvasar. 18. And it is when they grant approval to the spiritual leader, the truthful speaker of eloquence, the righteous Tanvasar, that those <i>of</i> the country obtain redress (bêsh<i>â</i><i>z</i>agânîh) when they seek <i>it</i>, and no deviation (anâyûînakŏîh) from the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t."'</p>  
 <p>19. As to the nature of the questions <i>and</i> statements of the organizer of the religion, Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a> son of Mâ<i>r</i>aspend, about the connection of the glory with the race, it also says this, that 'though righteousness <i>may</i> arise from the statements and prosperity of the Tûrânians when extracted by questions, <i>it is</i> said that its acceptance occurs there through complete mindfulness <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">2</font></a>; they benefit the embodied world of righteousness, and produce distress for the fiend; in like manner, they rely upon Vohûmanô, <i>and</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t is their delight through the report of the birth <i>of</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t from us who are archangels. 20. This liberality for thee is <i>from</i> us who are archangels, <i>and</i> Âtûrpâ<i>d</i>, the very best well-destined <i>man</i> arose; and this, too, do thou say about him, that it is the steel age in which that man, the organizer of development <i>and</i> organizer of righteousness, Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> son of Mâ<i>r</i>aspend, of the convocation, begets Avarethrab<i>a</i>u <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. This Avarethrab<i>a</i>u, too, is an organizer whose righteous guardian spirit we reverence, and <i>in</i> memory of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, the well-destined, and a progenitor of Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it says that 'only from him <i>comes</i> Avarethrab<i>a</i>u;' and <i>then also arises</i> this <i>one</i> of the adversaries of the religion, the apostate of apostates, whom they have even called the Mazdag-like (Mazdagîg-i<i>k</i>) <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 22. As it says this, too, about them, namely: 'This religion of mine thou dost survey with thoughts of spiritual life, thou dost very thoroughly inspect <i>it</i>, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when many, aware of apostates, call the performance of righteousness and even the priesthood innocence, and few are frank and practising <i>it</i>.' 23. In the revelation of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers is this, namely: 'Thoroughly look into revelation, and seek a remedy for them and any whatever of them who have become disturbing in the embodied existence, and uncaptivated <i>by</i> the orthodox (âyîn-aûmônd) righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences; and so they divide the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers through division of race, they speak regarding the action <i>of</i> their own <i>followers</i>, and give the endowment to their own. 24. They grant supplies of food, so that they <i>may</i> say the food is proportional to the hunger; they speak of procreation, <i>and</i> say that they say lineage is through the mothers; and they approve of wolfishness, so that they would act something like</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>wolves <i>in</i> the performance of gratifying their desires, like that of the wolf's progeny behind the mother. 25. Moreover, they form their lineage through the mothers; buying their women <i>as</i> sheep, they shall carry off for profit even that son <i>or</i> brother who is the progeny, those that we have produced for your companionship; you are not predominant, but <i>have</i> remained in companionship; you do not even believe them, <i>but</i> you do not establish an ordeal, although <i>it is</i> evident that you will be acquitted they lie even to <i>their</i> children, so that the advance of the promise-breaker is through them, and even in their own persons <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>26. Here it speaks about the organization of the religion <i>by</i> the glorified <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a> Khûsrôî, son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, thus: 'Upon their lingering behind, a man is produced who is righteous, the Glorified <i>one</i> <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a>, an approver (khênî<i>d</i>âr) of speech who is wise, whom the convocation, on hearing the words that he utters, speaks <i>of</i> as a high-priest; that is when he gives out penance (srôshîgîh), so that he may effect the punishment of sinners. 27. The constant out-pouring of perplexity (pê<i>k</i> shârî<i>d</i>an) <i>by</i> the perverters is the fear of that hero, as regards that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>convocation, when he casts <i>them forth</i> by expulsion from the vicinity, so that he may make <i>them</i> extinguished very quickly; owing to that, they, <i>whose</i> producer is even he who is a person destroying the righteous man, become gloomy on account of the Glorified <i>one</i>, through <i>his</i> smiting the spiritual life of apostasy; <i>just</i> as now, when he who is gloomy, <i>and</i> of scattered intellect, is gloomy owing to you <i>of</i> the Spîtâmas.' 28. This, too, it states, namely: 'In every way, I tell thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! that their time is mistrustful (av<i>â</i><i>v</i>ar) as to him who is an open friend, <i>and</i> most deceitful both <i>to</i> the wicked and the righteous; the Glorified <i>one</i> is a controller (ayûkhtâr) exalting the creatures, <i>and</i> whoever is possessing the creatures of the righteous <i>ones</i> <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">1</font></a>, so that he remains again at work in the doings of the Glorified <i>one</i>, is <i>he</i> who is a combiner <i>of</i> the actions <i>and</i> an utterer of the true replies <i>of</i> that Glorified <i>one</i>.'</p>  
 <p>29, And about the occurrence of a symptom of the devastators of the sovereignty <i>and</i> religion of the country of Irân one wonder, which is associated with the religion, is even this <i>which</i> it mentions thus: 'Thereupon, when the first symptom of a ravager <i>of</i> the country occurs, <i>O</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! then the more aggressive and more unmerciful <i>in</i> malice becomes the tyrant of the country, and through him, too, they ravage (rêshênd) the house, through him the village, through him the community, through him the province, <i>and</i> through him even the whole <i>of</i> that manifestation <i>in</i> the country <i>of</i> any teaching whatever that occurs <i>through</i> the ravager <i>of</i> the country; and so the country should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>keep a man who is observant <i>and</i> learned on the watch, because information is in his mind. 30. <i>Thereupon, when the second symptom of a ravager of the country occurs, &amp;c.</i> <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">1</font></a> . . . . . . . . . . 31. Thereupon, when the third symptom <i>of</i> a ravager <i>of</i> the country occurs, the priestly people are disturbing the tradition, so that they speak nothing wisely; it is even on this account they do not accept them, and it is not when <i>one</i> speaks truly <i>that</i> the ravager <i>of</i> the country believes them, and through him, too, they ravage the house, through him the village, <i>through him the community</i>, through him the province, and through him even the whole <i>of</i> that manifestation <i>in</i> the country <i>of</i> any teaching whatever <i>that</i> occurs <i>through</i> the ravager <i>of</i> the country; and so, too, the country should keep a man who is observant <i>and</i> learned on the watch, because information is in his mind. 32. Thereupon, when the fourth symptom <i>of</i> a ravager of the country occurs, it upsets the replenishment of the fires, and upsets those men of the righteous, so that they shall not undertake the care of them; and thus they shall not convey the holy-water to him who is a priestly authority, so that they may not produce the seizing upon the stipend <i>of</i> the priestly authorities <i>by</i> him who is the ravager <i>of</i> the country; through him, too, they ravage the house, through him the village, through him the community, through him <i>the province, and through him</i> even the whole <i>of</i> that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>manifestation <i>in</i> the country <i>of</i> any teaching whatever <i>that</i> occurs <i>through</i> the ravager <i>of</i> the country; <i>and</i> so, too, the country should keep a man who is observant <i>and</i> learned on the watch, because information is in his mind.'</p>  
 <p>33. About the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, it also states this, namely: 'That very villain (mar), <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! brings those provinces on to running astray, so that he may make-those quite dissevered which constitute the existence of that powerful sovereignty; and then he is a thorough assailant of the righteous, then he is an assailant <i>of</i> the righteous with eagerness. 34. That same deadly <i>one</i> (mar), <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! does not continue living long afterwards; moreover his offspring disappear (that is, they perish utterly); but his soul falls to the bottom of the gloomy existence which is horrible hell, and upon their bodies every kind <i>of</i> unseemly unhappiness comes from themselves, owing to their own actions when they give approval to the imprisonment of a guardian of spiritual <i>affairs</i> who is eloquent, true-speaking, <i>and</i> righteous. 35. Against that deadly <i>one</i> he contends, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! for the spiritual lordship <i>and</i> priestly authority that I approve <i>as</i> good <i>for</i> the whole embodied existence; also against the preparation of a decree to produce evil decisions, <i>and</i> against the dismissal of litigants, whether heterodox or orthodox, who are of a family of serfs of a far-situated village and are making petitions.'</p>  
 <p>36. 'And <i>as to</i> the land, too, over which he wanders, the evil spirit utterly devastates their country through pestilence and other misery; and, moreover, strife which is tormenting falls upon that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>country, besides demon-worship which is iniquitous, <i>and</i> besides slander which is iniquitous. 37. And the strife which is iniquitous is not to be dissipated (<i>a</i>pâsî-aîtanŏ) from that country, nor the demon-worshippers who <i>are</i> iniquitous, nor the slander which is iniquitous, before the <i>time</i> when they give approval to him, to the priest who is a guardian of spiritual <i>affairs</i>, who is eloquent, true-speaking, and righteous; and it is when they give him approval, that they obtain healthfulness <i>for</i> their country when they pray <i>for it</i>, and not irregularly from him, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! '</p>  
 <p>38. And this which is recounted is a statement that is execrated (nafrîg-aîtŏ) by many, details from the Avesta as to occurrences <i>that will</i> arise after Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the dispersion (ang<i>â</i><i>v</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sovereignty of Irân from the country of Irân; <i>it is also</i> declared that this which is written happened <i>to</i> the knowledge of those of the world. 39. This, too, is about the evidence of the above:—'And if this which is declared from the Avesta, as to <i>what</i> happens after Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the end of the sovereignty of Irân, should not have happened, and <i>it being</i> the pre-eminence of the Avesta which really became this present treasure, it thereby ensues, owing to its position in that <i>former</i> <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the manifest absence of the destruction of those rulers <i>and</i> high-priests from Vi<i>s</i>tâsp onwards in this <i>latter</i> <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that it could not be connected with us <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>

III, cxcviii, 2, this apostate is said to have been an <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a> associate (ham-p<i>â</i><i>î</i>gar) of the Christian ecclesiastic Akvân, and yells out ten admonitions contradicting those of the righteous <i>S</i>ênôv who is mentioned in § 6 (see Peshotan's edition, vol. v, pp. 239, 311). It does not follow that he was a contemporary of <i>S</i>ênôv, and here he seems to be placed fully two centuries later.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_251">85:1</a> Probably Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_252">85:2</a> The founder of the Sâsânian dynasty, who reigned as king of the kings of Persia, A<i>D</i>. 226-241.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_253">85:3</a> Most of these qualities are applied to the angel Srôsh, the personification of obedience (see Yas. LVII, 1); also to Kavi Vi<i>s</i>tâspa and Karsna, son of Zbaurva<i>n</i>t, in Yt. XIII, 99, 106.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_254">85:4</a> Av. Ashi<i>s</i> vanguhi, 'good rectitude,' personified as a female angel; her description is given in Yt. XIII, 107, and is similar to that of Anâhita in Yt. V, 64.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_255">85:5</a> So spelt here and in §§ 17, 18, thrice in all; it is also thrice spelt Tansar, in Dk. III, last chapter, 7; IV, 25, 25, and this mis-spelling has led to the mis-pronunciation Tôsar. It appears, however, that Tanvasar is a transposition of Tanvars, 'hairy-bodied,' <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a> because we are told that Tansar, or Tanvasar, was so called on account of all his limbs being covered with hair (vars). his statement occurs in the introduction to Tanvasar's letter to Gushnaspshâh (Ar. <i>G</i>asnasf-shâh), king of Pa<i>d</i>ashkhvârgar (Ar. Farshvâdgar) and Tabaristân; and is made on the authority of an old Pahlavi copyist, Bahrâm Khûrzâd, whose Pahlavi was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in the middle of the eighth century, and that into Persian early in the thirteenth century (see Darmesteter's edition in Journal Asiatique for 1894, pp. 185-250, 502-555).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_256">87:1</a> A high-priest who was prime minister of king Shahpûhar II (A<i>D</i>. 309-379). He is often mentioned in Pahlavi writings, but in the Avesta he is only alluded to, apparently, by the title Râ<i>s</i>tare-vaghe<i>n</i>t in Yt. XIII, 106.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_257">87:2</a> A translation of Av. spe<i>n</i>ta-ârmaiti, the archangel Spendâ<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_258">87:3</a> So written, all three times in Pâzand. He is the Avarethra-bangh, <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a> son of Râ<i>s</i>tare-vaghe<i>n</i>t of Yt. XIII, 106, better known as Zaratû<i>s</i>t, son of Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> in his old age, for whom the Andar’z-î Âtûrpâ<i>d</i>-î Mâ<i>r</i>aspendân was written.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_259">88:1</a> Whose pedigree is traced back to Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar in Bd. XXXIII, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_258"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_260">88:2</a> Probably some disciple of Mânih, the heretic who had been put to death A<i>D</i>. 276-7. Mazdag was put to death A<i>D</i>. 528. See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 257 n, 278 n.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_261">89:1</a> This quotation, from a Pahlavi version of an Avesta text, would probably be very applicable to the state of the Persian people at many periods in the fourth and fifth centuries, when heresy was prevalent and orthodox Zoroastrianism was by no means universal. Some of the evils mentioned are inseparable from slavery at all times.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_263">89:2</a> Literally 'immortal-soulled,' Anôshak-rûbân, the usual title of king Khusrô I, who reigned A. D. 531-578. Before he became king, A. D. 528 or 529, he had summoned an assembly of priests to condemn the heretic Mazdag, when the last important revision of the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta probably took place (see Byt. I, 6-8, and Nöldeke's Gesch. der Sas. pp. 463-466).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_264">90:1</a> Of the good spirits.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_265">91:1</a> The whole of this section is omitted in the old MS., evidently by mistake. Perhaps the second symptom of devastation was connected with the evil deeds of the warrior class, but this is very uncertain. Passages of four or five words are also omitted by the MS. in §§ 31, 32.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_266">93:1</a> The above declaration from the Avesta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_267">93:2</a> The present Avesta itself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="sbe4711.htm#fr_268">93:3</a> Meaning perhaps that, for some good reason, it could not be communicated to us in the extant Avesta. If § 39 be not a later addition to this chapter, it implies that the prophetical quotations from the Avesta, regarding the history of the religion after the time <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a> of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, were no more extant in the Avesta, when the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> was compiled, than they are now.</p>
