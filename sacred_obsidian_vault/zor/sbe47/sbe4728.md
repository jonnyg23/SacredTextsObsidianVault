 <p>1. About the righteousness of his desires <i>it</i> is thus declared, that when he became fifteen years old, the sons of Pôrûshaspô demanded a portion from <i>their</i> father, and their portions are allotted out by him. 2. Among the clothes <i>there</i> was a girdle, the width of which <i>was</i> four finger<i>-breadths</i>; and of the four <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">2</font></a> portions around and the girdle, which it was possible to bring forth, Zaratû<i>s</i>t selected <i>the latter</i> and tied it on him<i>self</i>. 3. This was owing to the precepts (parvânakân) of Vohûmanô who came into his reason at birth; as to whatever is not the custom <i>his</i> mind <i>was</i> now quite closed, and in that which is the custom <i>it was</i> impetuously exercised by him.</p>  
 <p>4. About <i>his</i> compassionate disposition and the streams of the Arag province <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">3</font></a>, this also is declared,</p>

 <p>that <i>there</i> was a river, <i>and</i> from them the body of a naked woman floated, for the reason that, on account of the strength and swiftness of the river, a woman, except when she <i>was</i> quite naked while she was in it, was not able to pass; and an old person, such as he who is of seventy years <i>and</i> is called in revelation a Hânô <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for want of power (apâ<i>d</i>îyâvandîh râî), was not able to go back through it by his own strength. 5. Zaratû<i>s</i>t came on to the bank of the water, <i>and</i> of women <i>and</i> old people seven persons had come, and are passed on by him, <i>in</i> the manner of a bridge <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">2</font></a>; it was an emblem of the <i>spiritual</i> performers <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">3</font></a> of bridging work, that is, of those providing a passage to heaven.</p>  
 <p>6. About his liberal disposition <i>it</i> is declared, that the fodder of Pôrûshaspô, which was stored for the beasts <i>of burden</i>, <i>was</i> not <i>only</i> for the beasts of Pôrûshaspô in a scarcity, but <i>also</i> for distribution among the beasts of others, which, owing to their hunger on account of the scarcity, then constantly ate off the tails of each other; <i>and it was</i> given to them plentifully.</p>  
 <p>7. About his abandoning worldly desire, <i>and</i> his laying hold of righteousness of way, this, too, is declared, that when he became twenty years old, without the consent (<i>b</i>ên akâmakîh) of <i>his</i> father and mother, he wandered forth <i>and</i> departed from</p>

 <p><i>their</i> house, and openly enquired thus: 'Who is most desirous of righteousness <i>and</i> most nourishing the poor?' 8. And they spoke thus: 'He who is the youngest (kêhistô) son of Aûrvaîtŏ-dih <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">1</font></a> the Tûr, who every day gives an iron caldron (<i>g</i>âmak), which is the height of a horse, full of bread and milk <i>and</i> other food, unto the poor.' 9. Zaratû<i>s</i>t went on to that place, and with his co-operation, for the nourishment of the poor, some of the chief men performed duty by carrying forth food for the poor.</p>  
 <p>to. About his compassion, not only upon mankind, but also his other creatures, this, too, is declared, that a bitch <i>was</i> seen by him, which had given birth to five <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">2</font></a> puppies, and it was three days then that she <i>had</i> not obtained food <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 11. Whomever she saw, she then advanced her mouth towards him, and became as it were prostrated; Zaratû<i>s</i>t provided a remedy, <i>by</i> swiftly bringing up bread for her, <i>but</i> when <i>he was</i> bringing it she had expired.</p>  
 <p>12. About his own desire for the good quality <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">4</font></a> of a wife, on account also of the will of <i>his</i> parents, <i>and his</i> not mingling his own seed before a suitable obtainment, this, too, is declared, that when his father sought a wife for him, Zaratû<i>s</i>t argued with the bride (nêsh<i>â</i>) thus: 'Show me thy face, so that I may find out (barkhâm) its kind of appearance, <i>and</i> this, too, whether its appearance <i>be</i> undesirable, or shall not be gratifying;' and the bride turned away her face from him. 13. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus:</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'Whoever takes away a sight from me, does not practise respect for me.'</p>  
 <p>14. About his <i>having</i> accepted progress even from the iniquitous, <i>that</i> listened sinfully desirous, who accepted so much advantageousness as <i>was</i> manifest, this, too, is declared, that he came into an assembly who were well known in the place for much knowledge, and he enquired of them thus: 'What is most favourable for the soul?' 15. And they spoke thus: 'To nourish the poor, to give fodder to cattle, to bring firewood to the fire, to pour Hôm juice into water, and <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="sbe4729.htm#fn_468"><font size="1">1</font></a> to worship many demons with words, with the words which are called revelation (dênô).' 16. Then Zaratû<i>s</i>t nourished the poor, foddered the cattle, brought firewood to the fire, and squeezed Hôm into water, <i>but</i> never are any demons whatever worshipped with words <i>by</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>

It is <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a> one of the two mythical rivers which were supposed to bound the Irânian world, and seems to represent the Aras as a northern and the Nile as a western boundary.
