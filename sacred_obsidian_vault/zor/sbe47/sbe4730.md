 <p>1. About the seven questionings (7-fra<i>s</i>nŏîh), with reference to religion, of the seven archangels, <i>which</i> occurred in seven places <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. For the occurrence of the first questioning <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">3</font></a>, that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the person of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who <i>was</i></p>

 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>the upholder of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, came out to a conference on the bank of the water of Dâîtîh <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. For the occurrence of the second, <i>which</i> is Vohûmanô's, five animals out of the five species <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">2</font></a> which are the worldly tokens of Vohûmanô, have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference on Hûgar and Aûsind <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and on that day also, before their coming out to the conference, <i>their</i> tongues are fully liberated <i>and</i> spoke with human words. 4. And among the rest <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">4</font></a> is a fish of one species, Arzuvâ <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>by</i> name; of those in burrows (khanŏîgânŏ) <i>are</i> the white ermine <i>and</i> white marten; of the flying creatures (vâyandagân) is the Kar<i>s</i>ipt <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">6</font></a>, a bird like a species of water-fowl; of the wide-travellers (farâkhvŏ-raftârânŏ) is the hare which is showing wild beasts the way to the water; and of those suitable for grazing (<i>k</i>arakŏ-ar<i>g</i>ânîgân) is the white ass-goat; with human words they also accepted the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. With the chieftainship of the five species they are intrusted, so that the like animals also, with their own voices, <i>and</i> as much as their knowledge is capable, shall recount the powerfulness <i>of</i> the religion.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 6. And freedom from assault, exemption from persecution, and proper maintenance of the five species of animals, <i>were</i> prescribed by him <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">1</font></a> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t with seemingly very awful admonition.</p>  
 <p>7. For the occurrence of the third questioning, which is A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô's, the spirits of the fires have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at the Tô<i>g</i>ân water <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and, in that questioning, care for the proper maintenance of the Varahrân fire <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the propitiation of all fires, is explained to him.</p>  
 <p>8. For the occurrence of the fourth questioning, which is Shatvê<i>r</i>'s, the spirits of the metals have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at Sarâî <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">4</font></a>, a settlement on the Mîvân <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">4</font></a>; <i>and he was</i> fully admonished about various proper preservations of the metals, <i>and as to</i> not producing warlike accoutrements of gold.</p>  
 <p>9. For the occurrence of the fifth questioning, which is Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of the regions, frontiers, stations (aûstâmân), settlements (rû<i>d</i>astâkân), and districts, as many as were desirable, have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference <i>where</i> there is a spring (khânîgô-aê) which comes out from the Asnavad mountain <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">5</font></a>, <i>and</i> goes into the Dâîtîh, like those of Satavês who is blowing the Pâîrîgs <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 10. And <i>Zaratû</i>s<i>t was</i> also thus admonished</p>

 <p>by her, about the care and propitiation of the earth: that each district is <i>to be</i> intrusted <i>to</i> a faithful testifier (gôkâs-î v<i>â</i><i>v</i>ar), each settlement <i>to</i> a judge acquainted with the law, <i>each</i> station <i>to</i> an officiating priest (magôpatŏ) of just intentions, <i>and</i> each frontier <i>to</i> a pure priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>ŏ); over all is proclaimed the councillor of the spirits, the supreme priest (magôpatânŏ magôpatŏ), and through him the sovereignty of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is provided.</p>  
 <p>11. For the occurrence of the sixth questioning, which is Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of seas <i>and</i> rivers have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at the Asnavad mountain <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and he <i>was</i> told about the care and propitiation of water.</p>  
 <p>12. For the occurrence of the seventh questioning, which is Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of plants have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference on the precipitous bank of the Dare<i>g</i>a <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">2</font></a>, on the bank (bâr) of the water of Dâîtîh, and different places; and he <i>was</i> informed about the care <i>and</i> propitiation of plants.</p>  
 <p>13. The seven questionings are explained within the length of these winters, which are <i>of</i> five months, <i>and</i> within ten years <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_495"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_499">160:3</a> Av. Hukairya of Yt. XII, 24, and Us-hindu of Yt. VIII, 32, described in Bd. XII, 5, 6, as two neighbouring mountains, for the pure water of Arêdvisûr falls from the summit of Hûgar to Aûsind which stands in the circumambient ocean.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_496"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_500">160:4</a> The remainder of K 35, the MS. brought by Westergaard from Kirmân, is lost; but an old copy of it (BK, see the Introduction) exists in Bombay, which supplies the missing text, as an authority independent of T.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_497"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_501">160:5</a> See Bd. XIV, 26; apparently the same as the Ari<i>z</i>, or Kar, the chief of fish, ibid. XVIII, 3, 5; XXIV, 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_498"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_502">160:6</a> See Bd. XIV, 23; XIX, 16; XXIV, 11.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_499"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_503">161:1</a> By Vohûmanô, as the protector of useful animals.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_500"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_504">161:2</a> Possibly the Te<i>g</i>end river, the Zend or Zôndak of Bd. XX, 7, 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_501"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_505">161:3</a> The Bahrâm, or sacred fire at places of worship.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_502"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_507">161:4</a> Names not clearly identified, and readings uncertain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_503"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_508">161:5</a> In Âtû<i>r</i>-pâtakân, and the Gû<i>s</i>nasp, fire was established upon it (see Bd. XII, 2, 26; XVII, 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_504"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_509">161:6</a> Pahl. 'Satavês-t Pâîrîg damânŏ ânŏ <i>k</i>îgûn.' Referring probably to Yt. VIII, 8, 9. Satavês is the southern chieftain of the stars, as correctly stated in the Iranian Bûndahi<i>s</i> (compare Bd. II, 7; XIII, 12); and the Pâîrîgs are meteors.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_510">162:1</a> See § 9.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_507"></a><a href="sbe4730.htm#fr_512">162:3</a> The Pahlavi is rather vague, but it is clear that Zaratû<i>s</i>t starts for his conference at thirty years of age (Chap. XXI, 1), returns from it ten years later (Chap. XXIII, I), and the conversion of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp occupies two years longer (Chap. XXIII, 5), occurring when Zaratû<i>s</i>t was forty-two years old and thirty-five years before his passing away at the age of seventy-seven (Chap. XXIII, 9).</p>  
 <p>At this point another dislocation of text occurs in all existing <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a> MSS., owing to the accidental interpolation of three loose folios of another text, between this chapter and the next, in some unknown copy written before 1530. In the MSS. the text is written continuously, without division into chapters. But the connection of this chapter with the next one, which is here restored to its proper position, is clearly shown by the reference to the 'ten years' of conference, with which this chapter ends, and the next one begins. The accidentally interpolated text is here classified as Chaps. XXIV and XXV, but its real connections have not yet been traced.</p>
