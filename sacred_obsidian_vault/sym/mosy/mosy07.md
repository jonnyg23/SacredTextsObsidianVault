 <p>That a great number of <i>gammadions</i> have been mere ornaments, monetary signs, or trade-marks, is a fact which it would be idle to dispute. But the uses which have been made of this figure in all the countries which I have just instanced, the nature of the symbols with which it is found associated, its constant presence on altars, tombstones, sepulchral urns, idols, and priestly vestments, besides the testimony of written documents and popular superstitions, afford more than sufficient proof that in Europe as in Asia it partook everywhere of the nature of the amulet, the talisman, and the phylactery. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">3</font></a> Moreover, for the <i>gammadion</i> to have thus become a charm, it must first of all have been brought into contact with a being, or a phenomenon, more or less concrete and distinct, invested, rightly or wrongly, with some sort of influence on the destiny of mankind. Might it not be possible to rind out this original meaning of the <i>gammadion</i> by laying stress on the indications provided by the monuments themselves?</p>

 <p>Many archæologists have thought so, whilst however arriving at different solutions. There is hardly a symbol which has given rise to more varied <a href="errata.htm#0">interpretations</a>—not even the <i>trisula</i> of the Buddhists, which is saying a great deal.</p>  
 <p>I will confine myself to mentioning the opinion of those who have confounded the <i>gammadion</i> with the <i>crux ansata</i> of the Egyptians, the <i>tau</i> of the Phœnicians, the <i>vajra</i> of India, the Hammer of Thor, or the Arrow of Perkun—all of which are signs having a form and meaning too clearly defined for this identification to be maintained without corroborative evidence. If even the <i>gammadion</i> ever replaced one of them—as in the Catacombs it sometimes takes the place of the Cross of Christ—it only did so as a substitute, as the symbol of a symbol.</p>  
 <p>Several writers have ascribed a phallic import to the <i>gammadion</i>, some, like M. J. Hoffman, seeing therein the union of the male with the female principle; <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">1</font></a> others, as Sir George Birdwood, believing that they recognize in it especially the symbol of the female sex. <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">2</font></a> The latter supposition would seem to be sufficiently justified by the position assigned to the <i>gammadion</i> on some female idols from the Troad, as also by its association with the image of certain goddesses, the Persian Artemis, Here, Demeter, Astarte. But the <i>gammadion</i> may very well have furnished a symbol of fecundity, as elsewhere a common symbol of prosperity and of salvation, without therefore being necessarily a phallic sign. In the one case, as in the other, the point in question is to ascertain if this is not a secondary meaning, connected with a less abstract conception.</p>  
 <p>General Cunningham believes that he found in</p>

 <p>the <i>swastika</i> a Pali monogram formed of four characters corresponding to our letters S. U. T. I. <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">1</font></a> But Professor Max Müller maintains that the likeness is hardly striking, and seems to be purely accidental. <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">2</font></a> In any case, the explanation would apply only to the Indian <i>gammadion</i>; an objection which may likewise be urged against Mr. Frederic Pincott's hypothesis, that the <i>swastika</i> is the emblem of the four castes united in the same symbolical combination. <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Waring held that the <i>gammadion</i> was a figurative <a href="errata.htm#1">representation</a> of water, on account of its resemblance to the <i>meander</i>, and also of its frequent occurrence in combination with the wavy line, a well-known symbol for water in motion. <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">4</font></a> However, as we shall see further on, this combination is far from being invariable, and certainly the form of the <i>gammadion</i> has, in itself, nothing which conjures up the idea of running water, or of rain.</p>  
 <p>Others have discerned in it a symbol of the storm, or lightning, because it can be separated into two zigzags or interlaced Z's. W. Schwartz, who, with his usual ability, has upheld this theory,—which conforms with his general views on the meteorological origin of myths and symbols,—draws attention to the numerous points of contact existing between the lightning and the different forms of the Cross not only in the symbolism of many religions, but also in popular language. <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">5</font></a> This agrees with the practice, so common in Catholic countries, of making the sign of the Cross, on the appearance of lightning, to prevent being</p>

 <p>struck, as also with the custom spread amongst our peasantry, especially in Flemish Brabant, of tracing a Cross in whitewash on their houses to preserve them from the same calamity. But it may be questioned if these customs are not owing to the general talismanic value which the Christian symbol receives in the popular beliefs: the sign of the Cross, in fact, is reputed to drive away evil spirits and to call in divine protection. As for Crosses painted on the outer walls, they seem to be held of use not only against lightning, but also against fires, epidemics amongst cattle, and, generally, against all the unforeseen accidents which threaten the dwelling-place.</p>  
 <p>In any case there is here no question of the <i>gammadion</i>, and the popular talk about the flashes of lightning "which cross" is not sufficient to account for the derivation of the form of the <i>fylfot</i>. I am well aware that amongst the ancient Germans, and even amongst the Celts, the <i>gammadion</i> is sometimes met side by side with the symbols of thunder on weapons, amulets, ornaments, and even on altars. But these objects present also to our view the image of the Disk, the Crescent, the <i>triscèle</i>, and many other symbolical figures. <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a> It would seem as if the engraver had simply wished to bring together all the symbols possessing, to his knowledge, a phylacteric, or talismanic character; by a process of reasoning analogous to that which, in the latter period of Greek paganism, prompted the manufacture of pantheian figures.</p>  
 <p>M. Emile Burnouf makes the <i>gammadion</i> the symbol of fire, or rather of the mystical twofold <i>arani</i>, that is to say of the fire-drill, which was used to produce fire amongst the early Aryans. "This sign," he writes, "represents the two pieces of wood forming the <i>arani</i>, whose extremities were</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>curved, or else enlarged, so that they could be firmly kept in place by four nails. At the point where they joined there was a small hole in which was placed the piece of wood, shaped like a spear, whose violent rotation, produced by whipping, made Agni to appear." <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Up till now it has been by no means proved that the lower part of the <i>arani</i> ever had the form of the <i>swastika</i> or even of the Cross. On the contrary there are reasons for supposing that it was usually a mere log of wood in which the point of the <i>pramantha</i> was made to turn. <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">2</font></a> Perhaps, in some cases, it had a circular form; the fire was then produced by making it revolve round a nave. If, as has been maintained, it really assumed, in some Indian temples, the appearance of the <i>gammadion</i>, it had doubtlessly been given this form to imitate the <i>swastika</i>. <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">3</font></a> As for the four points which are placed between the arms of certain <i>gammadions</i>, there is nothing to prove that they represent nails (see our <a href="mosy08.htm#img_pl02">plate II.</a>, <i>litt.</i> B, Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23), and in most cases they do not even touch the branches of the cross which, according to M. Burnouf, they are intended to fasten. Schliemann, who seems not unwilling to subscribe to M. Emile Burnouf's theory, observes that in Troas the <i>gammadion</i> accompanies the linear drawings of burning altars, <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">4</font></a> but—admitting that these are altars—can they not blaze in the honour of some other god than the fire itself? Further, nothing prevents us from supposing that the sun itself has been represented as a blazing altar.</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>In support of M. Burnouf's theory, attention might further be called to the fact that the <i>swastika</i> with branches turned towards the right is, amongst the Hindus, accounted of the feminine gender, which would make it agree with the symbolism of the <i>arani</i>. But it must be remarked that the <i>swastika</i> turned in the other direction passes as masculine. Moreover, according to Sir George Birdwood, it is a common custom in modern India to divide into the two sexes all objects occurring in interdependent pairs.</p>  
 <p>Mr. R.-P. Greg has written, in the Memoirs published by the <i>Society of Antiquaries</i>, London, a very interesting study on the <i>gammadion</i>, in which, whilst striving to deal impartially with the other explanations of this sign, he contends it is especially a symbol of the air, or rather of the god who rules the phenomena of the atmosphere, Indra with the Hindus, Thor with the ancient Germans and the Scandinavians, Perkun with the Slays, Zeus with the Pelasgians and Greeks, Jupiter <i>tonans</i> and <i>pluvius</i> with the Latin race. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a> Unfortunately, the proofs which he adduces are neither numerous nor conclusive. The fact that in India the bull is sacred to Indra, and that on certain monetary ingots the <i>gammadion</i> surmounts an image of this animal, is hardly sufficient to prove that the <i>swastika</i> is a symbol of Indra. <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">2</font></a> It is likewise difficult to admit that the <i>gammadion</i> represents the god of the atmosphere amongst the Greeks because on some pottery from Cyprus there are <i>gammadions</i> which recall the image of birds flying in the air.</p>  
 <p>The above-named writer makes much of the fact that on many incised monuments the <i>gammadion</i> is placed above images representing the earth,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>or terrestrial creatures, and below other images symbolizing the sky, or the sun. But this arrangement is far from being invariable or even predominant. Frequently the <i>gammadion</i> is found on the same level with astronomical symbols; sometimes even it occupies the upper place. Mr. Greg, it is true, gets over the difficulty by asserting that in this case it must represent the god of the ether in the capacity of supreme God. <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The only example I am acquainted with of a <i>gammadion</i> consecrated to Zeus, or to Jupiter, is on a votive altar, where it is incised above the letters I. O. M. <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">2</font></a> But this is a Celto-Roman altar, erected, to all appearance, by Dacians garrisoned in Ambloganna, a town in Great Britain; that is to say, that here again we may be in the presence of a strange god, assimilated to the supreme divinity of the empire, the <i>Jupiter Optimus Maximus</i> of the Romans. Moreover, the <i>gammadion</i> is here flanked by two four-rayed Wheels, symbols which M. Gaidoz has clearly proved to have been, amongst the Gauls, of a solar character. <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lastly, Ludvig Müller, Percy Gardner, S. Beal, Edward B. Thomas, Max Müller, H. Gaidoz, and others, have succeeded, by their studies of Hindu, Greek, Celtic, and ancient German monuments, in establishing the fact that the <i>gammadion</i> has been, among all these nations a symbolical representation of the sun, or of a solar god. I should like here to sum up the respective conclusions of these authors, setting forth, at the same time, the other reasons which have led me, not only to accept, but also to develop their interpretation. This attempt may perhaps be the less superfluous since, judging by the comparatively recent works of M. M. Greg</p>

 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>and Schwartz, the solar, or even the astronomical character of the <i>gammadion</i> is not yet beyond dispute.</p>
