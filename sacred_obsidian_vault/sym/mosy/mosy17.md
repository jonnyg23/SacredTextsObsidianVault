 <p>I have already referred to the importance of the Trident in the symbolism of Hinduism where, under the name <i>trisula</i> (<i>tri</i> three, and <i>sula</i> point, spear, or pale) it occurs amongst the most important attributes of Siva. This emblem exhibits no peculiarity of form here; it might as well figure in the hands of Hades, or of Poseidon. This is not the case, however, with respect to the Buddhist <i>trisula</i> or, at least, the symbol which bears this name amongst the Buddhists.</p>  
 <p>The <i>trisula</i> of the Buddhists, termed also <i>vardhamana</i>, "a crescent," may be described, in its</p>

 <p>simplest form, as an omicron surmounted by an <i>omega</i>.</p>  
 <p>It is, however, rarely met with under such a simple form. The upper arc of the <i>omicron</i>, or rather of the disk, is nearly always flanked by two small circles, or by two horizontal strokes which often assume the appearance of two leaves or small wings (fig. 143 <i>et seq.</i>). The points of the <i>omega</i> change into <i>fleurons;</i> the disk itself rests on a staff or pedestal, and from its lower arc fall two spires similar to serpents’ tails, the ends of which are sometimes curved upwards (<a href="#img_fig143">fig. 143</a>), and sometimes downwards (<a href="#img_fig154">fig. 154</a>).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="green">p. 238</font></a></p>  
 <p>At times the <i>trisula</i> appears to have only an ornamentive significance. Thus we see it crowning balustrades and porticoes, adorning sword-scabbards,</p>

 <p>and forming necklace-pendants and ear-rings. <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">1</font></a> But in most cases it unquestionably discharges the function of a symbol, and even of a religious symbol. Engraved on numerous coins by the side of religious emblems and images, it stands at the beginning and end of votive inscriptions in the caves of Western India. <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">2</font></a> The sculptures</p>

 <p>The oldest representations of the <i>trisula</i> are found—in conjunction with the principal symbols of Buddhism, the <i>swastika</i>, the <i>stupa</i>, the Sacred Tree, and so forth—on the coins of Krananda, <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">2</font></a> a native sovereign contemporary with Alexander or the earliest Seleucid kings.</p>

 <p>Nevertheless the <i>trisula</i> was far from being solely used by the Buddhists. In caves it is sometimes placed near symbols of the solar worship, and on the coins of the Indo-Scythic princes it is not only struck beside images of the Hindu god Siva but, what at first surprises us, beside those of Greek divinities, such as Zeus; <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">3</font></a> it is, moreover, possible that it became a mere monetary sign, as often happens with religious symbols used in coinage.</p>

 <p>with Buddhism, the twenty-fourth and last of the <i>Tirthankaras</i> or legendary saints of the sect has the <i>vardhamana</i> as a symbol; this personage even bears, according to Colebrook, the surname of <i>Trisula</i>. <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>It may be wondered, at first sight, that the innumerable texts left by Buddhism give us no positive information with regard to the meaning and origin of the <i>trisula</i>. Few symbols have given rise, in our own times, to more varied explanations.</p>  
 <p>Some have seen therein the monogram of Buddha; <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">2</font></a> others the symbol of the dharma, the Law, which sums up the doctrine of Buddhism; <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">3</font></a> others again a representation of the <i>tri-ratna</i>, the threefold jewel formed by Buddha, his Law, and his Church. <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">4</font></a> There are those who have discovered in the <i>trisula</i> the juxtaposition of the dharma <i>chakra</i>, the "Wheel of the Law" to the ancient letter <a name="img_24000"></a>
 <img src="img/24000.jpg">, <i>y</i>, which itself is said to stand for the mystic formula <i>ye dharma</i>. <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">5</font></a> Some scholars think they recognize in it the combination of five letters symbolizing respectively intelligence (<i>ma</i>) and the four component elements of matter, air (<i>ya</i>), fire (<i>ra</i>), water (<i>va</i>), and earth (<i>la</i>). <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>Eugene Burnouf thought he found therein the <i>vardhamana kaya</i>, "the Propitious One," one of the sixty-five signs which, according to Buddhist</p>

 <p>tradition, adorn the impression of Buddha's foot. <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Finally, according to some writers, we must seek its origins amongst the less abstract images of the naturalistic forms of worship which preceded Buddhism.—M. Kern, laying stress on the actual meaning of <i>vardhamana</i>, the present participle of a verb signifying "to grow or increase," makes it the image of the "horned moon," and sees in the central protuberance of the <i>trisula</i> the nose with which we ourselves sometimes adorn the representation of the lunar crescent <a name="img_24100"></a>
 <img src="img/24100.jpg">. <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">2</font></a> Edward Thomas seeks therein "an ideal combination of the sun and moon;" the alteration of the primitive form would, according to him, be due to a modification in the forms of worship, or to the overthrowing of the sovereigns termed Lunar by a Solar dynasty. <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Mr. Burgess recognizes therein an image of the Thunderbolt; <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">4</font></a> Sir George Birdwood, a phallic emblem, or else the Tree of Life; <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">5</font></a> Mr. Monier Williams, "the Two Feet of Vishnu, with a star or embossment in the middle." <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lastly, M. Beal takes it for the superposition of the Flame on the Lotus-flower, and M. Senart, of the Trident on the Wheel. <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></a></p>  
 <p>Among all these more or less contradictory opinions the interpretation of M. Senart is not only the simplest and most rational, but it is also strictly confirmed by the evidence of the monuments. There are many <i>trisulas</i> in which the upper part of the figure is separated from the Disk, some again in which it assumes distinctly angular forms <a name="img_24200"></a>
 <img src="img/24200.jpg">, instead of the rounded shape of the <i>omega</i>, ω; there are others, finally, in which it becomes beyond doubt a Trident, as amongst the sculptures of Buddha Gaya and of Boro-Budur. <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Trident superposed upon the Disk is also met with upon the coins of the anonymous prince</p>

 <p>The only point on which I have some doubt is when M. Senart puts forward the Trident as the original feature, and, so to speak, the primitive nucleus of the Hindu <i>trisula</i>,—which would make it, at least in its origin, an essentially Sivait symbol, destined to represent the flash of the lightning.—As for myself, I should be more inclined to seek this nucleus in the Disk, and, consequently, to connect the <i>trisula</i> with the solar symbols.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></a></p>  
 <p>From the most remote times the worship of the sun was widely spread throughout India, and, as nearly everywhere else, the sun was first of all represented there by a Disk, as may be seen from the sculptures of the ancient caves, and the ingots used for bartering before the introduction of coins properly so-called. <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">1</font></a> At a later date the Disk became a Wheel, and the Buddhists, who applied so many solar images and symbols to their form of worship, made it the <i>Wheel of the Law</i>, "formed of a thousand spokes darting out a thousand rays."</p>  
 <p>The secondary character of the <i>omega</i> (or Trident) in the <i>trisula</i> plainly follows from certain figures brought into view by Edward Thomas in</p>  <div align="center">  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">

 <p>his valuable work on the solar symbols of India. These are circles drawn between four <i>omegas</i>. One of these circles exhibits four arrows radiating from the circle between the crescents.</p>  
 <p>These figures indicate clearly the function of the Trident in the <i>trisula</i>. Doubtlessly, in the hands of Siva—as formerly in the hands of Neptune, and, at a still earlier period, in those of the Assyrian god of the air and the storm—the Trident must symbolize the flash of the lightning. But may it not be questioned whether, considered apart, it should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>not be held to be, in a wider sense, the image of a Three-tongued Flame, and, consequently, when coupled with the Disk, an emblem of fire, or of solar radiation?</p>  
 <p>Among the sculptures of Boro-Budur, in the island of Java, the Trident, which in some religious scenes is exhibited above the Disk, or Rosette, is replaced at times by a Three-pointed Flame. <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">1</font></a> Eug. Burnouf had already noticed, in the coloured representations of the Buddhas of Nepaul, that the headdress of the Master exhibits a ball terminating above in a kind of flame, and that on many Singhalese statues this flame takes the shape of "a kind of lyre or trident." <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">2</font></a> Finally, according to Mr. Beal, the <i>trisula</i> personifies, amongst the Buddhists of the north, the heaven of pure flame superposed upon the heaven of the sun. <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>The <i>trisula</i> is then certainly a Hindu symbol. It seems, however, to have felt, at an early date, the influence of the Caduceus. Perhaps even it was in order to approach the latter in appearance that the primitive Trident of the Hindu symbol assumed the rounded forms of the <i>omega</i> and placed itself in direct contact with the Disk.</p>  
 <p>Those who have some hesitation in admitting the possibility of discovering in a complex symbol the traces of a double antecedent—as we find in a child the characteristic features of both its parents—need only cast a glance over the following picture whose contents I have taken from the coinage and figured monuments of India.</p>  
 <p>I wish to call especial attention to the figures d and e. They resemble one another so closely that writers commonly rank the former as a <i>trisula</i> </p>

 <p>when they find it on the coins of certain Indo-Scythic princes. Yet there is no doubt but that it is directly connected with the Caduceus. Moreover,</p>

 <p>Fergusson himself has written with respect to the <i>trisula:</i>—"It bears a singular resemblance to the sign of the planet Mercury, or to the Caduceus of the god who bears this name." <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is also representations of serpents intertwined, closely allied to the Caduceus, which supply us with the earliest type of the lower appendages, in the shape of spires, observed in the <i>trisulas</i> of Sanchi and Amaravati (<a href="#img_fig143">fig. 143</a> and <a href="#img_fig154">154</a>).</p>  
 <p>On the other hand, the most complex forms of the <i>trisula</i> exhibit an unquestionable likeness to</p>

 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>some types of the Winged Globe which have been observed in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia and Persia.</p>  
 <p>In both figures the centre is occupied by a Disk which is sometimes converted into the Wheel, or the Lotus-flower. Does not the upper part of the <i>trisula</i>, which I have termed the <i>omega</i>, recall the horns of the Mesopotamian emblem, if we only take into consideration the knob between the horns caused by the upper arc of the disk (<a href="#img_fig150">fig. 150</a>);</p>

 <p>or else the projection caused by the tuft of plumes which surmounts the disk of certain Winged Globes (<a href="#img_fig151">fig. 151</a>)?</p>

 <p>The shaft, frequently conical, on which some <i>trisulas</i> rest, takes the place of the fan-shaped tail, and the spires traced on both sides of this support correspond with the lines, ending in a loop, which descend on either side of the tail in the ornithomorphic Disks of Western Asia.</p>  
 <p>In order to account for this likeness, I will venture on the hypothesis that these forms of the <i>trisula</i> must have been subjected, during their development, to the plastic influence of the ancient Egyptian symbol which had come to India by way of Assyria and Persia.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>The time is past when, dazzled by the sudden discovery of Vedic literature, and fascinated also by the verification of our relationship to the Aryan races of Asia, we turned towards India to seek them the universal source of symbols and dogmas, myths and gods. Since we caught a glimpse of the great antiquity of the civilizations which had reached their prime on the borders of the Euphrates and the Nile at a period when the ancestors of the Aryans were still wandering over the table-lands of Central Asia, we are far more inclined to locate in Mesopotamia, or even in Egypt, the earliest artistic centres which shed their light over the ancient world, from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.</p>  
 <p>On the other hand, India, up to the Mahometan conquest, did not live in the isolated condition to which historians were long pleased to relegate it. Sir George Birdwood goes, perhaps, a little too far when he asserts, in a general manner, that nearly all the symbols of India are of Mesopotamian origin. <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">1</font></a> But it is none the less an established fact now, that the products of western art and symbolism must have made their way to the valley of the Indus before the appearance of the oldest stone monuments on which ancient India has left us a vestige of its beliefs. <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>Without taking into consideration the intercourse which is supposed to have existed between the dwellers on the banks of the Indus and the most ancient empires of the Euphrates and the Nile, and without laying stress either on the factories which the Phœnicians are said to have established in southern India, I will recall to mind that Darius I</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>had annexed the valley of the Indus, and the actual province of the Punjab, about the end of the seventh century B.C. <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">1</font></a> Such competent authorities as James Fergusson and General Cunningham have shown that India borrowed its earliest style of architecture from the Persians, <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">2</font></a> and in the north-east of the peninsula there have been repeatedly found products of Persian art which date back to Darius and his successors—especially cylinders and coins bearing the Winged Circle. <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">3</font></a> It was in one of these finds that one of the coins of Tarsus containing a Winged Circle so nearly allied to the <i>trisula</i> was found (<a href="#img_fig151">fig. 151</a>).</p>  
 <p>It seems to be now generally admitted that the Indian alphabets are of Semitic origin. <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">4</font></a> Why then should religious symbols not have followed the same paths as the symbols of language and the creations of art?</p>  
 <p>In the centuries following the expedition of Alexander, it was Greek, or rather Græco-Asiatic art which influenced the development of Indian architecture and sculpture. Coins show us first of all sovereigns of Greek origin, who Hellenize Bactria, the Cabul country, and the valley of the Indus as far as the Ganges basin; then Scythic and Parthian princes who maintain, until the second century of our era, the language and traditions of this civilization imported from the West.</p>

 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> For more than two centuries the Greek Pantheon alone supplies images for the coins of western India. At most a few Buddhist emblems occur here and there; the <i>Bô</i> tree and the <i>stupa</i> under Agathocles, and the Wheel under Menander. From the time of Gondophares the representation of Siva alternates with that of Poseidon; yet the type of the two divinities remains so similar that on some coins it is difficult to decide if it is the Greek or the Hindu god. <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>At the same time, however, there occurs in India a veritable invasion of Iranian divinities. Mr. Percy Gardner and M. James Darmesteter, the former through investigating the coins of the British Museum, and the latter through the study of Persian traditions in the Hindu epic poem, came simultaneously to the somewhat startling conclusion that western India, after being Hellenised under the Indo-Bactrians, had been largely Iranised under the Indo-Scythians. <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">2</font></a> On the coins of the latter not only do Zeus, Pallas, Helios, Selene, Poseidon, Herakles, and Serapis alternate with Mithras, Mao, and Atar, as well as with Siva, Lukshmi, and even Buddha, but also the classic forms of the Thunderbolt, the Caduceus and the Cornucopia occur side by side with the Buddhist <i>trisula</i> and Wheel as well as with the Sivait Trident and bull.</p>  
 <p>India has always been the favourite home of religious syncretism; but at no period of its history did it open its portals to so many different forms of worship—even under Akbar, that great Mogul who was willing to combine in a single religion the beliefs of the Mahometans, the Hindus, the Parsees, the Jews and the Christians.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p>How could symbols have escaped an impulse which carried away the gods themselves? At any rate Buddhism would have been unfaithful to the spirit of its whole symbolism if, when acquainted with the emblems by which neighbouring religions represented their great solar divinity, or even their supreme god, it had not sought to appropriate them, either by adopting them as they stood with a new signification, or oftener by assimilating them, through slight linear alterations, with one or other of its favourite symbols.</p>  
 <p>It is, as we have seen, among the sculptures of Amaravati that the <i>trisula</i> assumes the form most closely allied to the ornithomorphic Disk. Now, nowhere else has the general influence of Græco-Asiatic art over native architecture and sculpture been verified in a more obvious manner. Already in the year 645 of our era the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Thsang likened the sanctuary of Amaravati to the palaces of the Tahia, <i>i.e.</i>, the inhabitants of Bactria. <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">1</font></a> The same fact has been recorded in our own times by James Fergusson: "There is," he writes, "so much of what is Greek, or rather Bactrian, in the architectural details of Amaravati that this monument must belong to a period nearer to the Christian era than the character of the inscriptions would lead one to suppose." And the eminent archæologist adds that the study of these sculptures seems to him destined to elucidate especially the interesting question of the intercourse, and even of the exchange of thought, between east and west. <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>moreover, the only factors which have reacted upon the genesis, or at least the development, of the <i>trisula</i>.</p>  
 <p>In an interesting paper, read in 1886 before the <i>Royal Asiatic Society</i>, Mr. Robert Sewell was perhaps the first to seek to the west of the Indus, and even in Egypt, the origins of the <i>trisula</i>, which he connects with the Scarab. The birthplace of a symbol is one thing; the origin of the figures which may have influenced its development is something very different. With this reservation, however, I must admit that there is nothing farfetched in this parallel, especially if, following</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig152"></a>
 <img src="img/fig152.jpg" alt="FIG. 152. (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xviii. (new series), fig. 13.)"></p>  
 <p align="center"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 152.</span><br> (<i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, vol. xviii. (new series), fig. 13.)</small></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Mr. Sewell's example, we interpose between the two figures the type of the Scarab with raised wings and bent legs which surmounts certain Assyrian columns.</p>  
 <p>But in Egypt itself, as M. Perrot shows, the flying Scarab borrowed the outlines of the Winged Globe, <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">1</font></a> by which fact, according to our theory, its resemblance to the <i>trisula</i> is sufficiently explained. It must be observed, moreover, that several of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>these Assyrian Scarabs hold between their fore-legs the Disk adorned with the <i>uræi</i>. <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>It may be noticed, by the way, that among the Egyptians the Trident already occurs in conjunction with the Winged Globe, at least in the texts. The inscription of Edfu, which relates how Horus was transformed into a Winged Globe in order to fight the armies of Set, gives him as a weapon a three-pointed spear. <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>On a number of monuments the Disk of the <i>trisula</i> changes into a Rosette, imitating an expanded lotus-blossom, as on the gate of Sanchi. The same monument further exhibits Lotuses at the ends of two stalks which spring from the basis of the central <i>fleuron;</i> finally, the two extreme points of the <i>omega</i> take a shape which suggests the calyx of a flower. We have already shown the solar character of the Lotus in the symbolism of the Hindus. <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">3</font></a> In the <i>trisula</i> the transformation of the Disk into a Lotus is therefore the equivalent, the plastic rendering of the transformation which, among the Buddhists, substituted the <i>padma mani</i>, or "Jewel of the Lotus," for the <i>sûra mani</i>, or "Jewel of the Sun"; whence the well-known formula:—<i>Om! mani padme</i>, "Oh! the Jewel in the Lotus!" <a name="fr_492"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>Elsewhere the <i>trisula</i> seems to reproduce the Sivait emblem of the <i>lingam</i> between two serpents standing erect. This figure, which when superposed upon the Disk has perhaps a doubly phallic</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>import, certainly seems quite foreign to the original doctrine of Buddhism. Yet here again the Buddhists have shown themselves to be masters in the art of adapting the symbols of other religions. M. Gustave Lebon, in his <i>Voyage au Népaul</i>, quotes a characteristic instance of the fanciful interpretations with the help of which Buddhism brings about or justifies these adaptations. "The <i>linga</i>," he writes, "is likewise adopted by the Buddhists of Nepaul as an emblem of the Lotus in which Adi-Buddha manifested himself, in the shape of a flame, at the beginning of the world." <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>It ought to be mentioned that, in the opinion of some writers, such as Ch. Lenormant and Baron de Witte, the Caduceus among the Greeks symbolized the combination of the two sexes in the</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig153"></a>

 <p align="center"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 153. Caduceus on an Amphora.</span> <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> (From the <i>Elite des monuments céramographiques</i>, vol. iii., pl. xci.)</small></p>  
 <p>same individual, hermaphrodism in fact, <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">3</font></a>—and in the valuable publication of those two archæologists upon the <i>Elite des monuments céramographiques de la Grèce</i> we find a variety of the Caduceus where a vertical projection, similar to the representation of the phallus, springs from the centre of the Crescent, which in this case is somewhat separated from the Disk.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p>On the coins of the Sunga dynasty the <i>lingam</i> placed between the serpents becomes the headdress of Buddha; the Disk stands for the Master's head, and the lateral appendages of the <i>trisula</i> are represented by two projections which stretch out horizontally on either side of this head. <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The <i>trisula</i> is thus seen to be converted into an anthropoid figure. A transformation of the same kind, but still more accentuated, is observable in the three famous idols of Puri which General Cunningham long ago proved to be three ancient <i>trisulas</i> (figs. <a href="#img_fig154">154</a> and <a href="#img_fig155">155</a>). <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p align="center"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 154. Trisula of Sanchi.</span><br> (<i>Musée des moulages</i>, Brussels.)</small></p>  
 <p>These emblems were doubtlessly a great object of popular veneration at the period when Puri was a Buddhist sanctuary. When Brahminism came to establish itself there it contented itself with changing them, by means of a few slight alterations, into the image of Vishnu, or rather Jaganath, and his brother and sister. In thus appropriating the old solar symbol, still discernible in</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>spite of its successive alterations, Vishnu, moreover, did nothing but recover what belonged to him, since he is, in Hinduism, pre-eminently the solar divinity.</p>  
 <p>Finally, the <i>trisula</i>, whose plasticity is only equalled by its power of absorption, borrows forms from the vegetable kingdom with the same freedom as from the human physiognomy. M. Rousselet points out the resemblance of the mystic symbol of the Buddhists to the <i>kalpavriksh</i> or Tree of Knowledge which the Jainas represented</p>

 <p>speaking, of the Trident which surmounts it, is nowhere more evident than among the sculptures of Boro-Budur, where it literally merges into the <i>Bô</i> tree through a series of gradual transformations. "The shape of the points of the <i>trisula</i>," M. Ch. Leemans writes in his able commentary upon the <i>Atlas</i> published under the patronage of the Dutch government, "may sometimes</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig156"></a>

 <p>have been derived from that of a flame, or else from the calyx of a flower, or again from a symbolic tree." <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">1</font></a> The same observation applies</p>

 <p>moreover to the Trident of Siva, which at times exhibits the forms of a lotus calyx depicted in the Egyptian manner (<a href="#img_fig157">fig. 157</a>).</p>  
 <p>Perhaps other transformations of the <i>trisula</i> might still be found at Boro-Budur. I will restrict myself to pointing out a detail which is not without interest: the same Disk which, when transformed into a most complicated ornament, is.</p>

 <p>sometimes crowned by a Trident, is also met with between two serpents—which brings us back to the origin of the Winged Circle—the Globe of Egypt with the <i>uræi</i>.</p>

 <p>Moreover this ornament, between which and certain forms of the <i>trisula</i> the transition is easily traced, commonly surmounts the entrance to the pagodas depicted in the bas-reliefs—in exactly the same manner as the Winged Globe adorns the lintel of the temples in Egypt and Phœnicia.</p>

 <p>It is proper to point out that in the West there are some figures which exhibit an odd resemblance to the <i>trisula</i>. Such is, in the first place, the Cyprian image to which I have drawn attention (<a href="mosy15.htm#img_fig114">fig. 114</a>), as presenting to our view a combination</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the Sacred Tree and the Winged Globe. The upper volutes with the flowered projection bisecting the centre of the arc recall the three points of the <i>trisula</i> with their central <i>fleuron</i>. The pair of volutes whose lower parts are bent downward on both sides of the base, suggest the ophidian appendages which, in the Buddhist symbol, descend on either side of the pedestal. Lastly in both cases, the middle part of the figures shows two leaves which by their position, as well as by their shape, suggest two small wings.</p>  
 <p>Mr. William Simpson, an English artist, well known on account of his archæological work in connection with the monuments of India, has</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig160"></a>
 <img src="img/fig160.jpg" alt="FIG. 160. THUNDERBOLT OF ELIS."></p>  
 <p align="center"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 160. Thunderbolt of Elis.</span></small></p>  
 <p>pointed out the resemblance of the <i>trisula</i> to some representations of the Thunderbolt graven on coins of Elis which date from the fifth century B.C. <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig161"></a>

 <p align="center"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 161. Sculpture of Boro-Budur.</span></small></p>  
 <p>This Thunderbolt especially resembles a somewhat enigmatical figure sculptured among the bas-reliefs of Boro-Budur, where, to all appearance, it plays the part of a <i>trisula</i>. <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>On the whole, there would be nothing remarkable</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>in these similarities, since the Thunderbolt and the <i>trisula</i>, as we have just seen, are both a development of the Trident.</p>  
 <p>What is more singular is to find a kind of <i>trisula</i> engraved on the flank of a lamb which adorns the serpent-shaped scroll on a pastoral staff dating from the Middle Ages. <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Have we here an exchange or a mere coincidence? This is a question which I will not venture to decide, although nothing is wanting in the Christian symbol to make of it a real <i>trisula</i>, neither the Disk, nor the central point imitating a <i>fleur-de-lis</i>, nor the rounded projection of the two lateral points.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>After all, if we have been able to find the antecedents, and, so to speak, the factors of the <i>trisula</i>, and even its probable signification in the creeds which preceded Buddhism, we have not learned much as to the meaning of this symbol in the religion which made most use of it. The fact is, that here the plastic figures cannot make up for the silence of the written monuments. So long as symbols remain images and are applicable to concrete objects, or physical phenomena, it is not impossible to discover the meaning which they in all probability bore. But when, having entered upon what may be called their derived or secondary phase, they become signs and express abstract ideas—which is nearly always the case in Buddhism—the field of interpretation becomes, so to speak, unlimited for critics, as sometimes also for the faithful.</p>  
 <p>The proper signification of the <i>trisula</i> remains then in the suppositive stage, although the purpose of its transformations does not always escape us. The issue of some hitherto unpublished text</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></a></p>  
 <p>can alone reveal to us the general and authentic meaning of this symbol, before which millions of our fellow-creatures have bowed down, but whose name we do not even know with any degree of certainty.</p>  
 <p>My purpose, moreover, was less to solve a problem whose solution has so far escaped the most competent minds, than to trace the transformations of the <i>trisula</i> in the course of its plastic development, and to show once again with what ease symbols of most dissimilar origin merge into one another as soon as, in their form, or in their meaning, there occur points of contact which are sufficient to facilitate this transition.</p>
