                                               Magickal Reveries 
                    Dedicated to Bill Heidrick 
                    ...who opened the door... 
                     
                     
                    I am as the Moon 
                    Our Light is ever changing 
                    Healing, gathering

                    As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                    From the depths of light 
                    As the distant Sun 
                    Begins Her Northward Path 
                     
                    Saturn begins her leaden rainbow dance 
                    Giving form to time 
                    The Gates to Formlessness 
                    Make way for new forms 
                     
                    To emerge out of Saturnian Black 
                    Gates of Formlessness 
                    Are now used by wise souls 
                    Seeking Endlessness 
                     
                    As new forms dance in, wise souls may dance out 
                    To Eternity 
                    To explore timeless states 
                    And spaceless being 
                     
                    Saturn planet of time and timelessness 
                    Space and spacelessness 
                    Of limits and freedom 
                    Is our leaden key 
                     
                    To the golden place of immortality 
                    The Bliss of Saturn 
                    Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                    In dark Capricorn 
                     
                    Agape is subtle wine, holy...pure 
                    While Chubby Eros 
                    Is a belching beer 
                    Good old, sad old lust 
 
 
 
                   
                  Is Thelema will with desire charged 
                    Is Thelema greed 
                    Drunk on yeasty-rich lust 
                    Rapine in her heart 
                    Or is Thelema subtle will, divine 
                    Heaven's Spirit scent 
                    Beyond sight, will or mind 
                    Like good Christian Faith 
                     
                    As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                    From the depths of light 
                    As the distant Sun 
                    Begins Her Northward Path

                    The Gates to Formlessness 
                    Make way for new forms

                    Space and spacelessness 
                    Of limits and freedom 
                    Is our leaden key

                    The Bliss of Saturn 
                    Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                    In dark Capricorn 
                     
                    Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                    Enfold me within 
                    Protect me, Mother, 
                    In my loneliness 
                     
                    Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                    Enfold me within 
                    Lead me to earthly love 
                    Lead me to my Self 
                     
                    Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                    Enfold me within 
                    Surround me with lovers 
                    Who heal me with love 
 
 
 
                   
                  Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                    Enfold me within 
                    Allow me loving friends 
                    Who heal me with love 
                    Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                    Enfold me within 
                    Lead me to earthly love 
                    Lead me to my Self 
                     
                    When bright spark was struck at dark equinox 
                    Hard clarity came 
                    As Sun struck Saturn 
                    In His Earthy home 
                     
                    The Astral Year begins in Saturn's house 
                    In chill mystery 
                    The leaden wheel begins 
                    Her twelve month circle 
                     
                    From Earth to Air to Water to Fire 
                    Then again begin 
                    Spinning wheel of magick 
                    Through time and through space 
                     
                    Twelve stations of the Elemental Cross 
                    Break the calender 
                    Wear tattered calender 
                    Like torn beggar's rags 
                     
                    Twelve mundane months slip over Heaven's Year 
                    Solstice to solstice 
                    Tearing the paper year 
                    With ancient power 
                     
                    Now the dark solstice has come and has gone 
                    Year is born anew 
                    New Year's day ahead 
                    Surly overlay 
                     
                    Vying with our more ancient starry year 
                    The New Roman Year 
                    Trys hard to hide the Gods 
                    Nor can it hide them 
                     
                    For their power is born ever anew 
                    Through the twelve stations 
                    And deep in each month 
                    Their Life births Magick 
                     
                    As Virgo dies the dark Crone encroaches 
                    Hard with Grey Power 
                    Harsh-shrivelled with Wisdom 
                    Of a long chaste life 
 
 
 
                   
                  What seems to be ugly, mean grows in strength 
                    Like a walnut shell 
                    Wrinkled shell, wrinkled nut 
                    Wrinkled wise, old brain 
                    Cruel Death mercifully releases Beauty 
                    Libra roses rise 
                    Gentle Autumn breezes 
                    Pink, red, soft petals 
                     
                    From peak to craggy peak the Horn'd One leaps 
                    Fire in his eyes 
                    Hard shouldered...white-hot chest 
                    Antlered man on high 
                     
                    Blue lightening flashes from his bright-hot thighs 
                    Swift knees crash through trees 
                    In the ancient forest 
                    Of my ancient mind 
                     
                    From those depths my ancient powers rise 
                    Fire in my eyes 
                    Soft heart hardens.  Wisdom 
                    Surges in my thighs 
                     
                    Knees and ankles loosen, muscles tighten 
                    I am the Horn'd One! 
                    I am He!  I am Free! 
                    Ancient One in me! 
                     
                    Affirmation:  I am Pan!  I am Cernunnos!  I am the Horn'd        One.   I am
             Shiva!  I am He!  I am Atman!  I am Free! 
                     
                     
                    Is Peace possible on Battlefield Earth 
                    No.  Not now, Kali 
                    Your Yuga demands War 
                    War is our teacher 
                     
                    Only through War can we learn to escape 
                    Your prison of Time 
                    The only Peace there is 
                    Is hidden within 
                     
                    Each individual heart.  Turn within 
                    Make that your War 
                    Exploit the Battlefield 
                    By turning away 
                     
                    That is War enough in Kali's prison 
                    Of Time and of Space 
                    Learn to reverse the Field 
                    And find your own Peace 
                     
 
 
                                                                                            1885
