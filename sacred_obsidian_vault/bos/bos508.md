               BURNING TIMES/CHANT       
                           -Charles Murphy
                                         
  In the cool of the evening, they used to gather, 'neath stars in
       the meadow, circled near an old oak tree.
  At the times appointed by the seasons of the Earth, and the phases
       of the moon.                      
  In the center of them stood a woman, equal with the others, and
       respected for her worth.          
  One of the many we call the Witches, the teachers and the keepers
       of the wisdom of the Earth        
  The people grew through the knowledge she gave them, herbs to heal
       their bodies, spells to make their spirits whole.
  Hear them chanting healing incantations, calling forth the Wise
       Ones, celebrating in dance and song
                                         
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
                                         
  There were those who came to power through domination, and they
       bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.
  They sought control of the common people by demanding allegiance
       to the church of Rome.            
  And the Pope declared the Inquisition, it was a war against the
       women whose power they feared.    
  In this Holocaust against the nature peoples, a million European
       women died.                       
                                         
  And the tales are told of those who, by the hundreds, holding
       together, chose their deaths in the sea.
  Chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess, a refusal of betrayal,
       women were dying to be free.      
                                         
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
                                         
  Now the Earth is a witch, and the men still burn her! Stripping
       her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.
  While to us the Earth is a healer, a teacher, a mother.
  She's the weaver of the web of life that keeps us all alive.
                                         
  She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.
  She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive!
                                         
  Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna....(repeat ad lib)
                                         
                         *               
                                         
                                         
                                         
 
 
                                                                             2293
