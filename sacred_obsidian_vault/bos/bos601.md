 ---- A WICCANING PART 4 ---
 
 
 
 THE DIVULGENCE OF THE NAMES (explained to the Witnesses):
 
 ANCIENT EUROPEAN PEOPLES BELIEVED THAT YOU MUST HAVE TWO
 NAMES, ONE PUBLIC AND ONE A SECRET NAME THAT ONLY THOSE
 PRESENT AT THE BLESSING CEREMONY KNEW. THIS SECOND NAME
 IS FOR USE AFTER PUBERTY, WHEN THE SOUL CHANGES INTO ITS
 FIRST ADULT SELF, WHEN IT CAN BE UTTERED ONCE MORE, AND
 MADE PUBLIC. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC NAME WAS TO
 DIVERT THE EVIL EYE, TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE FATES, TO
 KEEP AWAY SICKNESS, AND TO HELP THE CHILD REACH ADULTHOOD.
 
 Priestess:
 "Great Spirit of Nature, protect and guide these young souls
 among us. May the Blessings of the wise and joyous Father of the Gods
 far-seeing and far-knowing be upon thee. May the blessings of the Triple
 Goddess, of Maiden, of Mother, of Crone, and all their power
 be upon thee."
 
 
 The following blessings/invocations were spoken and followed by
 the child being immersed in the ocean water of the beach where
 the ritual was held:
 
 ELIZABETH'S DUNKING:
 
 Anna Perenna
 Great Goddess, Mother of All
 Envelope this daughter of yours
 in the waters of Your womb
 Grant her protection from wrong-doing
 Wash away the memories of her pain
 Shower her with Your blessings
 in a life everlasting
 Bless Elizabeth Mae Luzerne.
 So Mote it Be!
 
 
 
 PATRICK'S DUNKING:
 
 Great Goddess, Nurturer and Bearer of all Men, great and small
 Without whose womb they would not be
 Mother of Gods, of Sacrificial Kings,
 Presidents, Emperors, and beggars
 Welcome this son of Yours into Your Light
 and as you have taught us, let him find
 "Beauty and strength, power and compassion,
 mirth and reverence, honor and humility"
 within his heart.
 Wash his fears away with your caress!
 Bless Patrick Howard Lloyd!
 Blessed Be!
 
 
 MORGAINNE'S DUNKING:
 
 Hail, o gracious and most magnificent Lady
 whose slender hand turns the vast wheel of the sky.
 whose triple aspect does see
 the beginning, the life, and the end of all things.
 whose wells of mystery do give
 inspiration and rebirth thoughout eternity,
 receive here this small daughter of yours with blessings
 and with love.
 Bless Morgainne Ellayne!
 So mote it be!
