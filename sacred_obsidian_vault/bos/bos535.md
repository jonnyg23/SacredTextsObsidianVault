                                        A DRAGON TALE
                                         by Kalioppe
                     ====================================================
 
           The Bardess of Caer Sidhe, am I, dropping in to tell you the tale of
           the last living Dragon on Earth - you know - the one who lived over
           the vale. The battle was great 'twixt the Wizard and she.  The Last
           Dragon met her demise.  When the smoke had all settled, the Wizard
           looked 'round; an object caught his sharp eyes...
 
           "Lo! What is that?" sayeth the Wizard.  "Good Goddess!  I think it's
           an egg!"  He scooped it up and sped to the castle, as quick as he
           could on old legs.  Now the townsfolk were thrilled that the Dragon
           was gone. They applauded the Wizard as great...he told not of the egg
           that he cared for so well, as he feared the babe's possible fate.
 
           The egg hatched and the Dragon was healthy.  The Wizard loved him so
           well! But one night as the Wizard lay sleeping, he awoke by the
           tinkling of bells. "Twas the Ancients who came a calling, to tell him
           his time was near.  He thought, with a jolt, "Who will care for this
           babe...the one who has grown so dear?"
 
           Sadly, he called the Council and told of the callers in the night.  He
           told them of the Dragon and then explained his plight.  He told them
           that the Dragon was the symbol of the strong.  He persuaded them to
           care for him... then began his journey long.
 
           All wanted to care for the baby...but then the touble broke out! 
           There were too many squires and not enough peasants...a cauldron of
           trouble, no doubt!!  "I want to feed it!"  "I want to school it!"  "I
           do!"  "No, me! Not you!"  They set up rules so lofty, the work was
           done by only a few...
 
           Jealousy brewed more turmoil, and then the bragging began:  "I gave up
           MY food for the baby...yes, I am a WONDERFUL man!"  "That's NOTHING!"
           said one woman.  "I gave him my ONLY shawl!"  Egos rose and swelled so
           great, they encompassed one and all.  Sadly enough, it got to the
           point with themselves they were duly impressed.  They never saw to the
           Dragon...they were too busy with egos, at best.
 
           The baby died of hunger.  The baby died alone.  The baby died of
           ill-attention, too weak to even moan.  When the folk returned to the
           castle and found their charge quite dead, they looked at each other
           and pointed their fingers, then looked at the sky overhead.  The
           clouds were dark, but from their depths, many voices spake as one: 
           "The first law is love," spake the Goddess, "The second is 'ye harm
           none!'"  Emptiness welled up inside as their tears began to stream. 
           For they had killed the Last Dragon, and their one and only dream...
 
           That is the story I traversed to tell, and to it, I beg, pay great
           heed. Always take time to help one another - the time to do a good
           deed. Everyone is different, though the same at times, it seems. 
           Accept your neighbors differences, and cultivate their dreams.
 
 
                                                                             2363
