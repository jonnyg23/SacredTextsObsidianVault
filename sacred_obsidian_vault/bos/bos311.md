                               Satanism, A Personal Definition 
                                         By Delphine
 
           Please keep in mind that Satanism is a *very* individualistic
           religion,  and if  you  asked 50  Satanists  what Satanism  is,  you'd
           probably get 60  different responses.  As a  solitaire Satanist,  I'll
           have a go at this..  but I'm pretty bad at trying to  summarize what I
           believe, so please feel free to ask me questions.
 
           For me, these are the most important things I believe as a Satanist:
           *I believe in Satan as a literal entity. Many other Satanists do not,
           esp. those from the LaVey school of thought.
 
           *Satan is NOT a fallen angel, or a lesser created being, but instead a
           deity with as much power  (for lack of a better word) as any other. He
           is  the Shadow, a Destroying Deity.. and by such destruction,he purif-
           ies, for death of anything leads  the way for rebirth. He is  a symbol
           of rebellion, of pride, and of righteous anger.  He brings freedom, in
           many different ways.
 
           * My first care  is to myself, for if  I am unable to serve  myself, I
           have no basis by which to judge the actions of others. I strive for
           excellence, in a sense, very close to what Setians call "Xeper".
 
           *I believe in  free will,  with the understanding  that "with  freedom
           comes  responsibility".  I do  not accept  the  threefold law,  or any
           specific prohibitions like "harm  none". In relating to others,  I use
           the rule "do  unto others  AS they  do unto you".  If I  am harmed  or
           treated with  dishonor, I will not continue to treat such persons in a
           way that is more than they deserve. Revenge, at the proper time and in
           a fitting manner, is acceptable behavior. If there are consequences to
           such revenge, I will accept them responsibly.
 
           *I will  endeavor to  be honorable  about my own  actions, and  I will
           expect the same behavior from others.
 
           *I see Satan in Nature, in the floods, hurricanes, volcanoes, and
           tidal waves. I see fundamental laws in Nature, that death is as
           necessary as life. I am humbled and empowered by this, for though it
           blindly destroys, it is yet a part of me, as deity is immanent and
           transcendant to me. Satan the transcendant is that excellence that I
           strive for, Satan the immanent is the spark in me that strives.
 
           * I am polytheistic. The divine, to me, is like a jewel with many
           facets, each a part of us, each with something to teach us. No such
           lesson, to me , is greater or lesser than any other; but are instead
           more or less appropriate for a person at a given time.
 
           There is  a great deal  more I could  say, and in  greater detail, but
           this covers  a large part of Satanism to  me. Of course, I'm sure that
           Diane Vera, Sheryl, Balanone,  and others will have  different beliefs
           than I do.  It seems that individualism and personal  pride seem to be
           the link between most serious Satanists.
