                      Modern Wiccan Concepts based in Literary Satanism 
 
           By: Diane Vera
 
           As I pointed out to Warren Grant in the PAGAN echo recently, Charles
           G. Leland mentions Michelet in the Appendix to _Aradia:_
           _Gospel_of_the_Witches_: "Now be it observed, that every leading
           point which forms the plot or centre of this _Vangel_  [...]  had
           been told or written out for me in fragments by Maddalena (not to
           mention other authorities), even as it had been chronicled by Horst
           or Michelet" (pp.101-102, 1974 Weiser paperback edition).
            .
           In _A_History_of_Witchcraft_, Jeffrey B. Russell writes:
           "Michelet's argument that witchcraft was a form of social protest
           was adapted later by Marxists; his argument that it was based on a
           fertility cult was adopted by anthropologists at the turn of the
           century, influenig Sir James Frazer's _Golden_Bough_, Jessie
           Weston's _From_Ritual_to_Romance_, Magaret Murray's _Witch-
           Cult_in_Western_Europe_, and indirectly T.S. Eliot's
           _The_Waste_Land_" (_A_History_of_Witchcraft_, p.133).
            .
           Russell states further: "Neopagan witchcraft has roots in the
           tradition of Michelet, who argued that European witchcraft was the
           survival of an ancient religion.  This idea influenced Sir James
           Frazer and a number of other anthropologists and writers in the late
           nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The publication of
           Charles Leland's _Aradia_ in 1899 was an important step in the
           evolution of the new religion of witchcraft.   [...]   The doctrines
           and practices of the witches as reported by Leland are a melange of
           sorcery, medieval heresy, witch-craze concepts, and political
           radicalism, and Leland reports ingenuously that this is just what he
           expected, since it fitted with what he had read in Michelet"
           (Russell, p.148).
            .
           As far as I know, it's possible that Michelet's influence on Gardner
           was only indirect, via the other above-named writers.  This would
           not invalidate my point, which is that Michelet played a key role in
           the development of the ideas in question.
            .
           Michelet has had a more direct influence on feminist Goddess
           religion than on Wicca proper.  Michelet's _La_Sorciere_
           (_Satanism_and_Witchcraft_) is listed in the bibliography of
           _Woman,_Church,_and_State_ by Matilda Gage (19th-century Women's
           Suffrage leader and the founder of pre-Wiccan feminist Goddess
           religion) and, more recently, in _Witches,_Midwives,_and_Nurses:_
           _A_History_of_Women_Healers_ by Barbara Ehrenreich and Dierdre
           English (1973).
            .
           In my opinion, Michelet's most important contribution to both Wicca
           and feminist Goddess religion was that, as far as I know, he was the
           first well-known writer (in recent centuries, anyway) to use the
           word "Witch" (capital W) with its present-day positive connotations
           of healing and opposition to tyranny.
