                                                 THE MOONPOOL 
               - 
                 It is a lazy, restful time 
                  here in the forest glade. 
                 The sun is departing, the stars arriving 
                  and the trees are a darkening jade. 
               - 
                 An air of buzzing, drowsing stillness 
                  invades the meadow, lends weight to my head 
                 as I settle down - bedroll, backpack 
                  and strains of music are seemingly played. 
               - 
                 A deep, cool, dark pool is here, 
                  mirror clear, reflections of skies, 
                 as peace fills my mind, my soul 
                  and sleep gently touches my eyes. 
               - 
                 I know not whether I was awake, or in dream 
                  or how much time had passed, 
                 when I felt the magic of this place 
                  camped there, upon the grass. 
               - 
                 No sounds - no crickets? (The Music!) 
                  As the Moon awakens the pool, so bright. 
                 Why this anticipation, premonition, 
                  this magical feeling, this ghost haunted night? 
               - 
                 Then, a siamese cat enters the meadow- 
                  silver grey, regal compusure, flowing lines. 
                 And somehow I know - I see intelligence 
                  and wit, and power, as she looks into my eyes. 
               - 
                 How does she speak without speaking? 
                  But somehow, she communicates good will, and cheer. 
                'Stay quiet, childe of man.', she says. 
                 'Be still - you are but a guest here.' 
 
                Then a parade of feline musicians 
                  wandered in singing from the right. 
                 I shake my head *bedazzled*; Am I dreaming, or mad? 
                  Why me - here to witness this eldritch sight? 
 
 
 
                                      THE MOONPOOL  (cont.)
               - 
                 A troupe of dancing, cavorting gnomes 
                  made their appearence upon a rocky stage. 
                 And following them : silver clad, haughty elves 
                  accompanied by a wizened old mage. 
               - 
 
                 Now, many strange but noble presences made manifest 
                  on that starlit night in June. 
                 And I witnessed and heard sweet music, high magic, secrets 
                  until dawn, with the passing of the Moon. 
               - 
                 And the high bred Queen of Cat Folk 
                  smiled with warmth, and left. 
                 Left me shaking with these visions, 
                  and nodding, I finally slept. 
               - 
                 I return often to these stately woods, seeking 
                  but never finding the sacred pool, so bright. 
                 It makes me sad - very sad to think 
                  that it was but a dream, a peculiar night. 
               - 
                 But sometimes, at the edge of sleep, 
                  soft music slowly beckons, and calls. 
                 And I know with every fiber of my being 
                  that I will again visit these magical sylvan halls 
              
                                                                                            1863
