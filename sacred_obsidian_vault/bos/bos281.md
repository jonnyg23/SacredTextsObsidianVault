                          Practical Applications of the Chaossphere 
 
                                     by Fra.: Neonfaust 
 
            
 
           The Chaossphere is the prime working tool of Chaos magicians and the 
 
           Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT). The physical 
 
           Chaossphere has a vast range of applications of which a few shall be 
 
           briefly delineated here: 
 
            
 
           Meditation employing the Chaossphere: 
 
           1, The Chaossphere is a symbol of the primeval Big Bang, it maybe 
 
           considered as a "frozen explosion" or even as "frozen information". 
 
           Regard the Chaossphere in a relaxed state, using the 180* stare if 
 
           you prefer. After a while shut your eyes and meditate on the 
 
           creative powers of Chaos. Chaos is not disorder let alone entropy 
 
           but rather the sum total of all possibillities incumbent in 
 
           existence and the unmanifest as a whole. In this manner you will 
 
           open the doors to the magickal multiversum for yourself. 
 
           2, Proceed as described above simultaneously meditating on 
 
           Nietzsches Zarathustra admonition: 
 
           "I say unto you: a man must have chaos yet within him to be able to 
 
           give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: ye have chaos yet 
 
           within you." 
 
           You can have this statement read aloud to you by a partner or friend 
 
           during your meditation (or use a cassette recording). Experience 
 
           shows that this will greatly enhance the effect described above 
 
           under item number 1. 
 
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1392
 
 
           Sigil charging employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                In lieu of other charging techniques you can project the magickal
 
           sigil activation into the Chaossphere; banishing (preferably by 
 
           laughter) should follow immediately. Afterwards aim to forget the 
 
           whole magickal operation as thoroughly as possible to avoid 
 
           interference with the sigil`s operation by the unwanted rise of 
 
           consciousness of said operation/sigil and resultant inhibiting 
 
           psychic censor activity. 
 
            
 
           Drawing energy employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                To be  performed preferably  after a  meditation with  the Chaos-
 
           sphere  (see above); regard the Chaossphere in a very intensive manner
 
           for a  while and stretch your  palms in its direction.  Now close your
 
           eyes fully  or halfway and  suck in the  powers of Chaos  through your
 
           palms while inhaling;  exhaling, distribute the energies all over your
 
           body  or store them  in the  Hara centre  (appr. three  fingers` width
 
           below the navel).  You will  probably experience these  energies as  a
 
           warm or cool current, possibly as a slightly tingling sensation. 
 
            
 
           Telepathy employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                During a partner experiment participants concentrate on the 
 
           Chaossphere (can also be performed with different participants 
 
           working on different locations); observe in a very relaxed state 
 
           messages, information and/or images rising from the unconscious. 
 
           Advanced magicians will find that this experiment can be performed 
 
           successfully via great distances even without participants 
 
           practising simultaneously. For Chaos (= pure information) is not 
 
           restricted by space and time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1393
 
 
           Astral projection and lucid dreaming employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                1,  Using the  180* stare  regard the  Chaossphere until  you ex-
 
           perience a strong suction emerging from the sphere and pulling at your
 
           "psychic entrails". This can frequently even be felt as a strong 
 
           physical sensation. Give way to this suction and let your astral 
 
           body emerge gradually. In the beginning this should be practised 
 
           partially, ie. the astral body portion extracted increasing with 
 
           every subsequent attempt. Thus, you may for example only project 
 
           half an arm the first time, the full at the next go etc. Finally the 
 
           astral body should emerge totally. Be aware that astral projection 
 
           may demand weeks` or months`  dedicated practice to succeed, depending
 
           on personal  talent and inhibitions. Incidentally,  the same technique
 
           may be  used to  extract the  magickal doppelganger,  personal daemons
 
           etc. 
 
 
 
                2, Immediately before dropping off to sleep visualize the 
 
           Chaossphere as accurately as possible and continue as described 
 
           above. This will induce either stronger astral projection or lucid 
 
           dreaming or both. This has proved to be an extremely powerful 
 
           exercise, but it is strongly suggested that you attempt it only 
 
           after having acquired a thorough working knowledge with the variaant 
 
           described above under item 1. (If you start off with mental working 
 
           chances are that you will very soon become severely sloppy without 
 
           even being aware of the fact; this may in turn inhibit control of 
 
           magickal powers and could lead to obsession.) You may also want to 
 
           wake yourself up at 4 a.m. and give this exercise a try for a few 
 
           minutes before dropping off to sleep again. Take care to note your 
 
           dreams next thing in the morning, do not - repeat: DO NOT! - rely on 
 
           your memory alone. 
 
            
 
 
                                            1394
 
 
           Activating psychogones/chaoservitors employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                Use the Chaossphere as a "base camp" and "home" for psychogones/-
 
           chaoservitors and/or  as a  form of "launching  pad". In  case of  the
 
           former  the Chaossphere presents itself  as a high  class power recep-
 
           tacle  and storage  battery from  which you  can extract  your psycho-
 
           gones/chaoservitors  into the Chaossphere as  you would with sigils to
 
           be activated; thus,  the Chaossphere will become a gate  to the Sphere
 
           of Chaos  for your magickal  entities in which  (and from  which) they
 
           will become active in accord with your bidding. 
 
            
 
           Charging magical objects employing Chaossphere: 
 
                Magical objects such as talismans, amulets, fetishes etc. can be 
 
           charged with the aid of the Chaossphere by fastening them to the 
 
           sphere or its tip during a ritual, placing them under it etc. while 
 
           directing the energies of Chaos into the objects in question. 
 
            
 
           Combat magic training employing the Chaossphere: 
 
                During combat magical training the Chaossphere is particularly 
 
           suited as a power storage battery out of which the magician draws 
 
           Magis or Mana. It is furthermore used as a combat target while 
 
           practising the kiai or other battle cries and martial arts Chi 
 
           techniques. In the same manner, magickal energy bolts, curses, words 
 
           of powers and strong affections are hurled emphatically into the 
 
           Chaossphere where they may be stored for further use. 
 
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1395
 
 
           Charging the Chaossphere: 
 
                Experience  has shown  that  the Chaossphere  does  not demand  a
 
           special 
 
           charging by ritual etc. Rather, the charging takes place alone by 
 
           its practical application. Should you desire to incorporate magickal 
 
           "condensator" fluids or solids (eg. as used for charging magickal 
 
           mirrors) this can easily be achieved by unscrewing the tips and 
 
           replacing them after filling in the condensator.
