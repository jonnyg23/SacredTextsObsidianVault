                                            Storm 
                
              Lightning flashing, wind howls through trees, 
              Storm is rising, Mortals flee. 
              Like armies marching, clouds parade by, 
              Thunder shaking, rain hides the sky. 
                
              Earth trembles under Titan's fist, 
              As Elementals meet in their violent tryst. 
              Jagged bolts from Heaven descend 
              
              and Tree their goal to rend. 
                
              Fierce are the powers of the storm, 
              Chaos rules and dissolves Reality's form. 
              Fear walks the Earth in the Lightning's stark Kiss, 
              While rain hides the Shadows in Unholy mists. 
                
              But like all things this to must pass, 
              And after a time, storm ceases to harass, 
              The wind abates and the thunder mutes, 
              And Lightning ends it's violent pursuit. 
                
              Sun peeks shyly from behind Thunderhead, 
              And a faint rainbow across the sky does thread. 
              One lone frog begins to sing, 
              And a few bright birds take to wing. 
                
              Slowly the mortal creatures crawl forth, 
              To bask in the Sun's strengthening warmth, 
              But even as the light returns to day, 
              Elsewhere Storm will enter the fray. 
                
              Storm into peace, night into day, 
              This is the circle, the Divine at play. 
              First one then the Other is the cycle of Life, 
              No stagnation, no quiet, just unending strife. 
                
              The Circle of Life is the Game we play, 
              While upon this Earth our bodies decay, 
              And when our storm of Life goes by, 
              Into the Light we must all die. 
                
                
              Life into death, dark into light, 
              This is the Circle, the Divine delight, 
              To experience death, and be reborn from the night, 
              To once again behold Divine Starlight. 
                
              Circling endlessly Eons fly past, 
              But even this too in the end won't last, 
              When the last sparrow falls and night draws to a close, 
              The last to die is one final rose. 
 
 
 
                                         Storm  (cont.)
                
              When all is merged in Divine Bliss, 
              And nothing is left the Divine to kiss, 
              Then up from the wells of Chaos will flow, 
              New Life, new forms the Divine to know. 
                
              Cycle upon cycle, Life upon death, 
              The Eternal cycle, Brahman's breath, 
              Form into Chaos, Chaos into form, 
              This is the Rule to which Life will conform. 
                
              One rule for life, one rule alone, 
              That nothing is Changeless, and Chaos follows form, 
              One Rule for Day and One rule for Night, 
              That Nothing is Eternal in the Eternal's sight.
