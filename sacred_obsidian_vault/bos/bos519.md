                 NOTTAMUN TOWN           
                      -Traditional       
                                         
     In Nottamun Town, in Nottamun Town  
     Not a soul would look up not a soul would look down
     Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
     To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
                                         
     I bought me a horse t'was called a grey mare
     Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
     Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
     Weren't a hair upon her that was not coal black
                                         
     She stood so still threw me to the dirt
     She tore at my hide, she bruised my shirt
     From saddle to stirrup I mounted again
     and on my ten toes I rode over the plain
                                         
     When I got there no one did I see   
     they all stood around me just looking at me
     i called for a cup to drive gladness away
     And stifle the dust for it rained the whole day
                                         
     And the King and the Queen and the company more
     Came a riding behind and a walking before
     Come a stark naked drummer beating a drum
     With his hands in his bosom came marching along
                                         
     Sat down on a hard hot cold frozen stone
     Ten thousand stood round me but I was alone
     Took my heart in my hand to keep myself warm
     Ten thousand was drowned that never was born
                                         
                          *              
 
 
                                                                             2310
