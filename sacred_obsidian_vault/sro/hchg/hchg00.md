 <p>STEPS TO THE   CROWN. Foolscap 8vo, buckram, 2s. 6d. net.</p>   
 <p><font size="-1">"Mr.   Waite has presented his philosophy of life in a series of aphorisms. The   author of this volume is well known as one of the best living authorities on   the history of mysticism, and the point of view here maintained is that of an   initiate. Man's highest destiny lies--as St. Augustine taught many centuries   ago--in his ultimate union with the Divine Nature. There are several hundreds   of aphorisms in this slender volume, all of them terse and pregnant."--<i>The Tribune</i>.</font></p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>
