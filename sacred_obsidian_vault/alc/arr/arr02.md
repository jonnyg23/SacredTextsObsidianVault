 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SMARAGDINE TABLES OF HERMES TRISMEGISTUS</h1>
 <p>said to be found in the Valley of Ebron, after the Flood.</p>
 <p>1<b>. </b>I speak not fiction, but what is certain and most true.</p>
 <p>2<b>. </b>What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is like that which is below for performing the miracle of one thing.</p>
 <p>3. And as all things were produced from One by the Mediation of One, so all things are produced from this One thing by adaptation.</p>
 <p>4. Its father is the Sun, its mother was the Moon, the wind carried it in its belly, its nurse is the Earth.</p>
 <p>5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world.</p>
 <p>6. Its power is perfect if it be changed into the earth.</p>
 <p>7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently and with judgment.</p>
 <p>8. It ascends from earth to heaven, and descends again to earth, thus you will possess the glory of the whole World and all obscurity will fly away.</p>
 <p>9. This thing is the fortitude of all fortitude, because it overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates every solid thing.</p>
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>
 <p>10.<b> </b>Thus were all things created.</p>
 <p>11. Thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in this way.</p>
 <p>12.<b> </b>Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistus, possessing the three parts of the philosophy of the whole World.</p>
 <p>13.<b> </b>What I had to say concerning the operation of the Sun is complete.</p>
