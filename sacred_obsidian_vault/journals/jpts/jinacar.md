 <p>   NOTE.—This recension is based on the following materials, for all of which I have to thank the generosity of Mr. Donald Ferguson, late of Colombo.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   (1) A Singhalese MS., denoted by C<sup><small>a</small></sup>, containing text and commentary. It commonly confuses cerebrals with dentals, and generally writes the nasal with º (anuswāra) before all consonants alike.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   (2) An edition in Singhalese characters (C<sup><small>t</small></sup>), published in Colombo in 1886, which has enabled me to correct nearly all the mistakes of the MS.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   (3) A rough transcript in Roman characters, and a draft of translation, both which I have found useul in doubtful points.</p>

 <h2 align="center">NOTE ON MEDHAŊKARA</h2>
 
 
 
 <p>   There are at least four Medaŋkaras famous in the literary history of Ceylon. The first flourished about 1200 A.D., and was the author of the 'Vinyārthasamuccaya' in Siŋhalese. The second was the Āraññaka Medhaŋkara, who presided over the Council held by Parākrama Bāhu III. about 1250 A.D. The third was the scholar to whose care Parākrama Bāhu the IVth entrusted his translation of the Jātaka book into Siŋhalese 'that it might be preserved in the line of the succession of his pupils' ('Mahāvaŋsa,' chap. xl., ver. 86). The fourth was our author, Vanaratana Medhaŋkara (who was also the author of the 'Payoyasiddhi,'  also in Pali), and who flourished under Bhuvaneka Bāhu the Ist (1277-1288 A.D.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   Saŋgharāja Medhaŋkara, author of the 'Lokappadīpakasāra (<i>Journal of the P.T.S.</i>, 1882, p. 126; 1896, p. 43), was different from all of the above, and wrote in Burma ('Gandha Vaŋsa,' p. 67). He is called Nava Medhaŋkara (<i>ibid</i>., p. 64).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   Medhaŋkara is mentioned as the author of the 'Jina Carita' in the 'Saddhama-saŋgaha,' ix., 22 (<i>Journal of the P.T.S.</i>, 1890, p. 63), and in the 'Gandha Vaŋsa,' pp. 62, 72 (<i>Journal of the P.T.S.</i>, 1886).</p>

 <p><a name="pp_4"><font color="GREEN">4</font></a> I will recite in brief the Life of the Conqueror, a blessing distributed far and wide, desiring ever to keep it in memory.</p>

 <p><a name="pp_6"><font color="GREEN">6</font></a> Therefore is this my discourse set out in fair verse, good, honey-sweet, pure, delightful to the listening ear.</p>

 <p><a name="pp_8"><font color="GREEN">8</font></a> A hundred thousand æons and four ago, there was a city the abode of innumerable beings, who always did good deeds,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_9"><font color="GREEN">9</font></a> provided with all manner of treasures, full of all manner of people, crowded with gay shops, adorned with arches and festoons,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_10"><font color="GREEN">10</font></a> echoing to the ten sounds, like the city of the King of the gods, called Amara, the Immortal, fair and grand.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_11"><font color="GREEN">11</font></a> There once was born of a Brahmin stock, respected through all the world, most merciful, most wise, handsome, beloved,</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_12"><font color="GREEN">12</font></a> a prince called by name Sumedha, who had traversed the ocean of the Veda. This nascent Buddha, on the death of his parents,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_13"><font color="GREEN">13</font></a> Having beheld the great wealth piled up in hundreds of chambers by the treasurer,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_14"><font color="GREEN">14</font></a> piled up the treasures, and cried: 'See, my father and the rest of my kin have gone to the world of gods without taking one small coin with them!'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_15"><font color="GREEN">15</font></a> The Mine of Mercy grew sad at this, and thought: 'Although I have received all this store of wealth, I too must go.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_16"><font color="GREEN">16</font></a> He sat down in solitude, in his own beautiful house, examining the blemishes in his body, and thus admonishing himself:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_17"><font color="GREEN">17</font></a> 'Painful is the breaking-up of the body, painful also is its beginning; I am subject to birth, to old age, to disease.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_18"><font color="GREEN">18</font></a> With these and like reflections, having seen in many ways the blemishes in his body, he sent the drum beating about the city and sent word to the King.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_19"><font color="GREEN">19</font></a> At the sound of the drums the beggars flocked together, as bees to a sweet scent, and for seven days he gratified them with the flood of the filaments of alms.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_20"><font color="GREEN">20</font></a> When he saw that although the precious gifts fell like a shower of snowflakes, the lotus-plantation of treasures was not exhausted,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_21"><font color="GREEN">21</font></a> amidst the tears of his kinsfolk, as a royal elephant flees from a forest blazing with fire, the great hero departed from his delightful house,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_22"><font color="GREEN">22</font></a> and came to the mighty Himalaya, perfumed with scents of yellow sandal, camphor, and aloes,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_23"><font color="GREEN">23</font></a> adorned with blossoming champak and asoka, trumpet-flower and tilak, areca-nut and punnāga, ironwood, and other trees,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_24"><font color="GREEN">24</font></a> filled with lions, tigers, hyænas, with elephants, cheetahs, and apes, with horses and other beasts,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_25"><font color="GREEN">25</font></a> full of the notes of maynahs and sunswans, of swans, herons, and parrots, of pigeons and cuckoos and vultures,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_26"><font color="GREEN">26</font></a> haunted by goblins, demons, heavenly musicians, gods and fairies, beings full of accomplishment and knowledge,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_27"><font color="GREEN">27</font></a> shining with great ranges of beautiful mountains all vermilion and sapphire, mountains of silver and gold,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_28"><font color="GREEN">28</font></a> brilliant with many a tank, provided with steps and

 <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a>
 
 
 
  stages of jewels and gold, with many a nymph divine dallying there,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_29"><font color="GREEN">29</font></a> irradiated with the spray from hundreds of secret cool cascades, delightful nooks full of fays and Nāgas,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_30"><font color="GREEN">30</font></a> with flocks of dancing peacocks and festoons of creepers, and garlands of white sand,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_31"><font color="GREEN">31</font></a> a treasure-mine of gold, jewels, and pearls, an abode of merit for those who desire it, as bees desire pollen.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_32"><font color="GREEN">32</font></a> Entered there, the brave one beheld in it the requisites for the ascetic, produced by Him of the Thousand Eyes, fine leaf-huts;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_33"><font color="GREEN">33</font></a> he adopted the ascetic garb, and he abode there for the space of seven days, stedfast in the Five Transcendent Faculties and the Eight Precepts.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_34"><font color="GREEN">34</font></a> In the joy of Attainment thus produced, the holy ascetic one day, passing through the air, saw some people</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_35"><font color="GREEN">35</font></a> sweeping the road. Descending then from the air, he asked the people: 'Why do ye sweep the road?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_36"><font color="GREEN">36</font></a> 'O Sumedha, knowest thou not? The Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara has attained to Supreme Might, and has set rolling the Supreme Wheel of the Law;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_37"><font color="GREEN">37</font></a> 'he makes the Canon of the Law for the world, and has reached the fair city Beautiful, and here dwells in Sudassana.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_38"><font color="GREEN">38</font></a> 'We have invited him with our alms, the ruler of the world, and his four hundred thousand Brethren pure.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_39"><font color="GREEN">39</font></a> 'For his coming, O thou of supernatural might, we sweep the path.' Thus spoke these people, giving joy to his ear.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_40"><font color="GREEN">40</font></a> On hearing the word Buddha, the mine of virtues, highly delighted in mind, could not keep in his usual state,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_41"><font color="GREEN">41</font></a> and the hero, asking a portion of the road which the other had begun, was given a rough place and began to make it smooth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_42"><font color="GREEN">42</font></a> Before that spot had been made ready by him, the one Lord of the world, worshipt by men and immortals alike, benefactor of the world, the great sage, entered upon the road with the pious ones.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_43"><font color="GREEN">43</font></a> Then as he saw there approaching the Tathāgata, blazing with six-coloured rays, happy in heart, he thought:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_44"><font color="GREEN">44</font></a> 'What if I make a bridge in the mud, and prostrate
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 36------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a>
 
 
 
  myself before this hero, the great sage, with his company?</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_45"><font color="GREEN">45</font></a> For a long time it will suffice for my blessing and happiness.' With this thought, the nascent Conqueror fell down,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_46"><font color="GREEN">46</font></a> and raising his lovely lotus-eyes, he looked; and again, as he lay there, thus the courageous one thought:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_47"><font color="GREEN">47</font></a> 'Should I wish, I could destroy the endless turmoil of existence, and become a novice of the Order, and enter the noble city.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_48"><font color="GREEN">48</font></a> 'What use in disguise? By the extinction of sin, I having become a Buddha like this Buddha, supreme in the world,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_49"><font color="GREEN">49</font></a> will ferry the people in the ship of the Law across the ocean of existence, and bring them to the City of Nirvāna, my own happiness being extinguished.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_50"><font color="GREEN">50</font></a> Thus thinking, prostrate there in the mud, he gleamed like a golden plantain stem,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_51"><font color="GREEN">51</font></a> beholding the beautiful form of the Buddha, shining with the six-coloured rays, the hero, jubilant with the joys that arose in him, longed for Buddhahood.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_52"><font color="GREEN">52</font></a> When he came to the place, and saw the sage prostrate in the dirt, he who had been the Bridge of the World, seeing the other made a bridge for him,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_53"><font color="GREEN">53</font></a> the hero, the Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara, the one Bridge of the World, the World's one Eye, stood at his head, and spake:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_54"><font color="GREEN">54</font></a> 'In time to come, this man shall be a supreme Buddha, Gotama by name,' and revealed his disciples, his native city, and so forth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_55"><font color="GREEN">55</font></a> This said and done, with his Order the pious one did obeisance to him, moving about him rightwise, and offered to him eight handfuls of flowers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_56"><font color="GREEN">56</font></a> Having done this, the ruler of the world with his company went to the city named Rammaka, a place beautiful with monasteries and houses.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_57"><font color="GREEN">57</font></a> The other, hearing the Conqueror's speech, arose from the dust, delighted, and reverenced by the hosts of the gods with offerings of flowers and other things,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_58"><font color="GREEN">58</font></a> and crossing his legs, sat down on the couch of flowers, the most austere, the most wise, Sumedha, conqueror of sense.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_59"><font color="GREEN">59</font></a> The gods in ten thousand spheres, delighted, praised the hero seated on the flowery couch.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_60"><font color="GREEN">60</font></a> As he sat, he pondered on the qualities which make

 <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a>
 
 
 
  a Buddha: whether above or below, at the four cardinal or the four intermediate points.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_61"><font color="GREEN">61</font></a> Thus meditating, he apprehended all the elements of the Law, his own image, and first the Perfections of Giving;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_62"><font color="GREEN">62</font></a> seeking further and further the Perfections in wisdom, he beheld all the Perfections by his eye of understanding;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_63"><font color="GREEN">63</font></a> and passing through successive transmigrations, he endured great suffering, seeking Nirvāna in tranquillity by fulfilling the Perfections of Giving;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_64"><font color="GREEN">64</font></a> this chief of givers was like a magic tree, or a magic wishing-jewel, giving to the world all their desires, food or what not.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_65"><font color="GREEN">65</font></a> He tore out his beautiful eyes, like stars in the sky, and joyfully gave them to those who asked;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_66"><font color="GREEN">66</font></a> The flesh of his own body and his blood he gave, as much as the dust of the earth and the water of the sea,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_67"><font color="GREEN">67</font></a> heads adorned with diadems, great as Mount Sineru, he gave, shaking the earth, and sons and wives to boot.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_68"><font color="GREEN">68</font></a> He fulfilled the Precepts, the Separation, the Wisdom, all the Perfections, he attained the Vessantara existence; and being born again from that place,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_69"><font color="GREEN">69</font></a> he came into being in the fair abode of the gods, the city of Tusita. There he dwelt for a long time, enjoying infinite happiness.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_70"><font color="GREEN">70</font></a> The gods in humble obeisance, made this request of the greatest of men: 'O mighty one, it is time for thee to become Buddha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_71"><font color="GREEN">71</font></a> He examined time and circumstances, and recognised that it was the time for Buddhahood, then giving his promise to the assembly of the gods, to the forest of Nandana,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_72"><font color="GREEN">72</font></a> he went with the hosts of the gods, and went to heaven, vanishing from this world amidst their praises, that wise one; vanishing thence, here,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_73"><font color="GREEN">73-5</font></a><a name="pp_74"></a><a name="pp_75"></a> in the picturesque city of Kapila, crowded with great coursers finely caparisoned, full of gaily-decked shops and wares, bright with beautiful tall lordly elephants, adorned with myriads of arches and banners, with spacious halls and watchtowers, with strong gates, the abode of fair women, laughing to scorn even the city of Purinda (India); to Suddhodana, lord of men, protector of the helpless, one of Okkāka's royal stock,
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 38------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a>
 
 
 
  the abode of many pure virtues, or lotus haunted by bees like jewels on Kings' heads,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_76"><font color="GREEN">76</font></a> the Most Wise showed in a dream a gold-coloured elephant like the pure moon, with a trunk like a pure white silver wreath, a noble festoon of white lotus;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_77"><font color="GREEN">77-8</font></a><a name="pp_78"></a> he entered the womb of the King's wife Māyā; lips like bimba-fruit she had, eyes like the flowering blue lotus, her eyebrows like the rainbow an ever-increasing delight, her mouth like a beautiful pure full moon, her breasts like a pair of golden geese, her feet like fair lotus shoots, the colour of her body shining like the colour of gold; adorned was she with the ornaments of many a virtue and good custom.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_79"><font color="GREEN">79</font></a> At the instant of his conception, beings manifold were born, and thereupon protection was assumed by men and immortals.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_80"><font color="GREEN">80</font></a> Like an image of gold seated in the pericarp of a lovely red lotus, all golden-coloured the chief of men sat cross-legged in his mother's womb.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_81"><font color="GREEN">81</font></a> Like a red thread strung through a clear jewel, the Wise One is seen causing his mother's mind to blossom.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_82"><font color="GREEN">82</font></a> At the end of ten months, thus spake the Queen to the King: 'I desire, O King, to go to the home of my family.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_83"><font color="GREEN">83</font></a> With the King's consent, she goes to her family with a large retinue, by a road which seemed to be divine.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_84"><font color="GREEN">84</font></a> Seeing a grove of sâl-trees adorned with a multitude of fragrant flowers, echoing with the sound of clusters of murmuring intoxicated bees, with a flock of bright-eyed birds, which seemed to invite her, the Lumbini Wood, a spacious place of delight,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_85"><font color="GREEN">85</font></a> she felt a very great desire for that fair spot. So with a charming step, like a divine maiden, she approached the root of a blossoming sâl-tree, and grasped a branch, which of itself bent low.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_86"><font color="GREEN">86</font></a> At that moment, the pangs of labour seized her; then her people ran up and surrounded the lady with screens; this done, they retired apart. Then</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_87"><font color="GREEN">87</font></a> she stood firm, and clinging to the branch by her red hand, soft as cotton, with its row of shining red nails, adorned with fine bracelets and ornaments of gold, brought forth the Wise One;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_88"><font color="GREEN">88</font></a> who, his body shining with a golden hue, fair to the eye, incomparable, his beautiful hands and feet fully
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 39------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a>
 
 
 
  extended, came forth from the womb of the incomparable mother, like a golden goose emerging from a lotus.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_89"><font color="GREEN">89</font></a> The Brahmas brought a beautiful priceless net of gold, and approaching, received him, and standing before her, said: 'Rejoice, O Queen! of thee is born a most excellent son.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_90"><font color="GREEN">90</font></a> Other men are born with their limbs smeared in filth; but the excellent lord of men was born pure, like a jewel lovely and priceless laid in a piece of fine Benares cloth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_91"><font color="GREEN">91</font></a> This done, down from the sky came two streams of water upon the body of the Beloved and on his mother's body, washing away the pollution to make all auspicious.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_92"><font color="GREEN">92</font></a> From their hand the delightful gods bringing a skin rug received the hero on a cushion of fine cloth, from their hand the best of men received that lion-king among men;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_93"><font color="GREEN">93</font></a> From their hand, a beautiful and pure moon, he stood firm upon the earth, his great feet marked with circles, and gazed with lotus-eyes at the eastern quarter.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_94"><font color="GREEN">94</font></a> The hundreds of spheres became as one court yard; men and immortals together worshipping the Wise One with perfumes and like offerings, and thus they spake:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_95"><font color="GREEN">95</font></a> 'There is no man like unto thee, O wise one: how then can there be one superior?' Thus the Lord of the World, seeing in this quarter not one like himself,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_96"><font color="GREEN">96</font></a> took seven paces towards the nook, and said: 'I am the chief of the world, choicest and best.'</p>

 <p><a name="pp_117"><font color="GREEN">117</font></a> then in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the company of the gods made merry in much joy, waving their scarves unceasingly and crying,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_118"><font color="GREEN">118</font></a> 'News! in the city of Kapilavatha is born a son to Suddhodana; he is seated upon the circle of the Bo-tree, and he will become Buddha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_119"><font color="GREEN">119</font></a> The mighty and most wise ascetic Kāladevala, the trusted adviser of the wise King Suddhodana,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_120"><font color="GREEN">120</font></a> after his meal had gone to the dwelling of the Thirty-Three, and there sat him down for the rest of the day.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_121"><font color="GREEN">121</font></a> He beheld them there sporting in festive costume, and asked them the reason of their joy, and they told him.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_122"><font color="GREEN">122</font></a> The sage, hearing this as it truly was, enraptured with joy, at once went to the dwelling of Suddhodana,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_123"><font color="GREEN">123</font></a> and entering, sat down upon a goodly seat, and said: 'They tell me, O great King, that a son is born to thee, incomparable, wise:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_124"><font color="GREEN">124</font></a> 'I wish to see him.' The King caused the boy to be sent for in his fine array, to salute the sage;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_125"><font color="GREEN">125</font></a> But child though he was, by the power of his virtue his fair lotus-feet uprose and placed themselves upon the ascetic's head.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_126"><font color="GREEN">126</font></a> In that position of the chief of men, no one in the three worlds must be worshipt: if the head of the lord of the three worlds had been placed under the ascetic's feet,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_127"><font color="GREEN">127</font></a> the ascetic's head would assuredly have burst asunder. He therefore stood with his hands claspt in supplication to the wise Ocean of Virtues, because he had not thought fit to destroy him.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_128"><font color="GREEN">128</font></a> The lord of men seeing this marvel, done by his own son the god of gods, gladly adored his soft lotus-feet, marked with various devices.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_129"><font color="GREEN">129</font></a> When the King's great sowing festival came on, the city was adorned like a city of the gods; and all the people in fair attire gathered at his noble dwelling-place.</p>

 <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a>
 
 
 
  a hero's grace went out to the incomparable sowing festival.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_131"><font color="GREEN">131</font></a> All the nurses went away to look on at the festival, leaving the child alone at the foot of a rose-apple tree, covered by a canopy painted in many colours.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_132"><font color="GREEN">132</font></a> Seated beneath the canopy, bright with gold, and shining with golden stars, at the root of the rose-apple-tree, the wise one took the opportunity and fell into ecstatic meditation.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_133"><font color="GREEN">133</font></a> The nurses returning, beheld him seated like an image of gold, and his splendour; and they said to the King, 'Such and such a marvel hae been done by thy son.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_134"><font color="GREEN">134</font></a> When he heard this of the lotus-eyed one, whose mouth is like the bright moon, he said, 'A second time I must worship him,' and set his head at his son's feet.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_135"><font color="GREEN">135</font></a> Beside these, other marvels took place also in the world, shown forth by me in due course in the compass of the book, reluctant though I am:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_136"><font color="GREEN">136</font></a> where were quantities of houses, glorious with all manner of gems, glorious with canopies and couches in plenty, fair with long flights of stairs and wide storeys, made ready to suit the three seasons,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_137"><font color="GREEN">137</font></a> multitudes of fine houses with rows of pinnacles, one row as it were always defying another, forests of lotus like rays of sunlight, illuminating the lotus faces of the folk;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_138"><font color="GREEN">138</font></a> by those walls inset with gems women adorn their bodies without even the reflexion of a mirror;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_139"><font color="GREEN">139</font></a> where is seen a circuit painted with whitewash, fair to the eye like Mount Kelāsa,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_140"><font color="GREEN">140</font></a> where is always seen a moat covered with lotus, with a great circuit of sapphire, set with many gems;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_141"><font color="GREEN">141</font></a> there he dwelt, the one all-seeing, until he came to maturity enjoying all delights. In going to the park for sport, upon the high-road</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_142"><font color="GREEN">142</font></a> he saw successively the three states of existence—old age, disease, and death, and was disgusted; on a fourth occasion he saw with pleasure in the same place the welcome form of an ascetic.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_143"><font color="GREEN">143</font></a> The illustrious one went to the beautiful grove, lovely as the forest of Nandana, thick with multitudes of flowering trees, and echoing with the notes of flocks of peacocks and other birds.</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_144"><font color="GREEN">144</font></a> There the royal chief of men, with a hero's grace, enjoyed the delightful playing, singing, and dancing of fair women like goddesses.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_145"><font color="GREEN">145</font></a> Seating himself cross-legged on a fair seat, he thought that he would cause his person to be adorned.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_146"><font color="GREEN">146</font></a> The King of the Gods, perceiving his thought, said to Vissakamma, 'Do thou adorn Siddhattha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_147"><font color="GREEN">147</font></a> At his command, Vissakamma approached, and wrapt the shining head of the glorious one with ten thousand shawls,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_148"><font color="GREEN">148</font></a> and his shining body, glorious with its unequalled marks, he made beautiful with variegated robes and ornaments, and with the sweet perfume of fragrant blue lotus, sandal, and other such.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_149"><font color="GREEN">149</font></a> Adorned by him, himself also adorned, he sat on a spotless slab of stone, attended by fair women like goddesses, and shining like the King of the gods.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_150"><font color="GREEN">150</font></a> A glad message was sent by King Suddhodana: 'A son is born to thee, my son!' Hearing this, the chief of men</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_151"><font color="GREEN">151</font></a> replied, 'To me this day a fetter is born,' and forthwith amid all the joys of success he returned to the beautiful city.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_152"><font color="GREEN">152</font></a> Then Kisāgotamī, in the upper story of the palace, saw the King shining like the sun, and thus she spake:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_153"><font color="GREEN">153</font></a> 'Whoever are the parents of this steadfast one, whosoever is the wife of the noble one, happy are they all, yea, always happy.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_154"><font color="GREEN">154</font></a> When he heard this pleasant speech uttered by her, gladdened within with joy, he went to his house,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_155"><font color="GREEN">155</font></a> he loosed from his neck the great necklace, cool, pure, exquisitely beautiful, and sent it to her;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_156"><font color="GREEN">156</font></a> then mounting to the terrace, lovely as Vejayanta, he reclined upon his precious seat like the King of the gods.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_157"><font color="GREEN">157</font></a> A company of fair women, like goddesses, attending on him, performed all manner of dances and songs;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_158"><font color="GREEN">158</font></a> but the wise one, longing for the ascetic life, free from the fine desires, cared nought even for dances and songs so lovely as these,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_159"><font color="GREEN">159</font></a> but after lying there on the couch awhile to rest, the hero, the mighty King, sat up cross-legged,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_160"><font color="GREEN">160</font></a> and sitting there, he beheld the changes that had come over the sleeping girls. Frightened at the thought

 <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a>
 
 
 
  of mortal life, he said, 'I will go now!' and passed through the fair doorway.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_161"><font color="GREEN">161</font></a> Channa lay with his head on the fair threshold, for he thought, 'I shall hear my master's call'; and as he lay there, that most righteous friend and counsellor, giver of joy, bringer of good,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_162"><font color="GREEN">162</font></a> the prince called him and said, 'Make ready the thoroughbred horse Kantaka, and bring him hither.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_163"><font color="GREEN">163</font></a> Channa listened to the order given to him, and went quickly and caparisoned the thoroughbred, and brought him.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_164"><font color="GREEN">164</font></a> The noble steed, thus made ready by him, knowing that his master was to leave the world, uttered a neigh:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_165"><font color="GREEN">165</font></a> that sound filled the whole city, but the gods one and all kept it from the hearing of any.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_166"><font color="GREEN">166</font></a> Then the delight of the virtuous thought, 'First I will go and see my own precious son, then I will become a Buddha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_167"><font color="GREEN">167</font></a> With this thought, he proceeded to his wife's apartments, and standing upon the threshold, thrust his head within.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_168"><font color="GREEN">168</font></a> He beheld his own son, lying like his mother upon a bed strewn with flowers, with the bed of the King of heaven;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_169"><font color="GREEN">169</font></a> seeing which the supreme ruler thought to himself: 'If I take my son from the Queen's arms,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_170"><font color="GREEN">170</font></a> 'Yasodharā might awaken from her great love, and cause delay in my leaving the world.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_171"><font color="GREEN">171</font></a> 'When I have become a Buddha, I will return and see my son.' Then the lord of men came down from the upper storey.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_172"><font color="GREEN">172</font></a> Yasodharā had lovely lotus-like face, hands, and feet, laughter like the foam, brows like shining wavelets, eyes like the blue lotus; she was like the moon; all eyes were attracted to her like so many bees:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_173"><font color="GREEN">173</font></a> Who that enjoyed possession of her body would renounce it, save this steadfast one, standing at the summit of perfection?</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_174"><font color="GREEN">174</font></a> 'I have brought the horse, sire: observe the time, lord of chariots!' so spake Channa to the glorious ruler of the earth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_175"><font color="GREEN">175</font></a> The lord of the earth heard what Channa had spoken;
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 45------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a>
 
 
 
  down from the palace he came, and went to Kanthaka.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_176"><font color="GREEN">176</font></a> To him spoke thus he who delights to do good to all beings: 'Kanthaka, in this one night convey me over gods and men.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_177"><font color="GREEN">177</font></a> 'I will become supreme Buddha, and escape from the world, from the ocean of existence, the terrors of decay, the multitude of monstrous growths.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_178"><font color="GREEN">178</font></a> With these words he mounted his thoroughbred steed, white as a conch shell, and caused Channa to grasp its strong tail.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_179"><font color="GREEN">179</font></a> When he came to the great gate, he thought: 'If the gate will not open by any means,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_180"><font color="GREEN">180</font></a> 'with Channa holding fast by his tail, I will press Kanthaka with my thighs, I will leap over the lofty shining wall, and begone.' So thought the mighty one.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_181"><font color="GREEN">181</font></a> Thus the strong one, and Channa, and the noble steed, each in his own heart thought of the way to get over the wall.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_182"><font color="GREEN">182</font></a> But the gods who inhabited the gate, perceiving his thought, and delighted at his happy going, then set the gate open.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_183"><font color="GREEN">183</font></a> Then Death thought, 'I will make this Siddhattha no Siddhattha'; and approaching, poised in air, he thus addrest him:.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_184"><font color="GREEN">184</font></a> 'Go not forth, O most wise! On the seventh day from now the divine treasure of the Wheel shall surely be made manifest.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_185"><font color="GREEN">185</font></a> But the glorious one, thus addrest by Death, replied: 'Who art thou?' and Māra declared himself.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_186"><font color="GREEN">186</font></a> 'Māra, I know that the divine Wheel will be made manifest. Go thou, and stand not here, for I have no desire for this kingdom.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_187"><font color="GREEN">187</font></a> 'I shall become Buddha, sole ruler of the world, and all the ten thousand systems of the universe I will cause to resound.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_188"><font color="GREEN">188</font></a> When the Great Being had thus uttered his supreme word, Māra, unable to entrap him, forthwith vanisht away.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_189"><font color="GREEN">189</font></a> After this speech of the Sinner, Gotama at dawn renounced the glory of universal dominion, like a drop of spittle, and there remained.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_190"><font color="GREEN">190</font></a> Then the gods assembled immediately, bearing thousands of precious torches, to show reverence to him as he departed.</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_191"><font color="GREEN">191</font></a> Behind him and before and on either side there went in reverence great serpents and garula birds;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_192"><font color="GREEN">192</font></a> here great host of gods, showering from the sky like rain showers of lovely blossoms, coming from the ten thousand worlds, exult exceedingly over the tender-bodied one;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_193"><font color="GREEN">193</font></a> on the bright and beautiful road, all sweet-scented goodly flowers, and aromatic powder, golden flags, where the noble royal steed as he went, entangled in flowers, could not go at speed,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_194"><font color="GREEN">194</font></a> thus he proceeded upon that lovely path of thirty leagues, amidst all this festivity, for the remainder of the night.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_195"><font color="GREEN">195</font></a> Reaching the bank of the river Anoma, he dismounted from his horse, upon a pure cool expanse of ground,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_196"><font color="GREEN">196</font></a> and having rested, thus he spoke: 'Go, Channa, to your own city, and take with you my ornaments and the horse.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_197"><font color="GREEN">197</font></a> Standing there, the all-wise one with his sword exceeding sharp cut off his fragrant hair, and cast it up to the sky.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_198"><font color="GREEN">198</font></a> He of the thousand eyes received the hair-relic as it rose into the sky, in a fair golden casket, bowing his head in reverence,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_199"><font color="GREEN">199</font></a> and in the Thirty-Three he set up a crest-gem shrine, delightful to the eye, made of sapphire, a league in height.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_200"><font color="GREEN">200</font></a> The noble Eight Requisites were brought by Brahma, and cast down as it were from the air, and the goodly pair of robes:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_201"><font color="GREEN">201</font></a> taking these, great Brahma made in Brahma's world a beautiful robe-stupa twelve leagues in height.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_202"><font color="GREEN">202</font></a> The hero went to the mango-grove named Anupiya, and there spent seven days, in the bliss of retirement from the world.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_203"><font color="GREEN">203</font></a> One day he proceeded along the thirty-league road as far as Rājagaha, where he went about piously seeking alms.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_204"><font color="GREEN">204</font></a> Then the walls and gates, by his radiance, appeared as if made of gold and set with sapphires.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_205"><font color="GREEN">205</font></a> The crowds of people, full of excitement, when they saw him, asked again and again: 'Who is this? Is it Sakka, or Brahma, Māra or a Serpent?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_206"><font color="GREEN">206</font></a> Having entered and obtained food enough for his

  living, he went along the high-road, looking before him no further than a yoke's length;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_207"><font color="GREEN">207</font></a> and leaving the people there perplext, as the sea is churned with the churning-stick of Mount Meru, he went to the Paṇḍava mountain,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_208"><font color="GREEN">208</font></a> where, seated under its shadow on a lovely spot, he began to eat the mingled food.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_209"><font color="GREEN">209</font></a> By contemplation, the wise and mighty one restrained the snake of his bowels from leaving the anthill of his body.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_210"><font color="GREEN">210</font></a> After eating, having been many times offered the kingdom by the great King Bimbisāra, the chief of men visited him.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_211"><font color="GREEN">211</font></a> He declined the kingdom; but when the King prayed, 'When you have become supreme Buddha, declare the Lord to me,'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_212"><font color="GREEN">212</font></a> he gave his promise to the lord of mankind. The wise one then retired to the cloister, and there performed exceeding great marvels and wonders. Then considering a little,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_213"><font color="GREEN">213</font></a> after partaking of plentiful meat and drink, and growing stout of body, like a god he came to the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_214"><font color="GREEN">214</font></a> There he sat, the giver of light, facing the east; and by the colour of his body, that banyan took on the colour of gold.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_215"><font color="GREEN">215</font></a> Then a fair woman named Sujātā, her prayer fulfilled, came to him, bearing upon her head a golden bowl full of rice and milk, and bowing before him, said:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_216"><font color="GREEN">216</font></a> 'I present an oblation to the spirit which dwells in this tree.' Then, seeing this incomparable man,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_217"><font color="GREEN">217</font></a> and conceiving that he was a god, joyful at heart, she gave the bowl of food to the noble one, saying, 'As my prayer was fulfilled, so may thine be, my lord.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_218"><font color="GREEN">218</font></a> With these words, the beautiful woman departed thence. And the sage taking the bowl of food,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_219"><font color="GREEN">219</font></a> went to the bank of the river Nerañjarā, and when he had eaten the choice food, cast her fair bowl against the current.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_220"><font color="GREEN">220</font></a> The noble being then proceeded to the incomparable grove, delightful as Sakka's grove of Nandana, adorned with clusters of full-flowering trees, which, like clusters of bees, captivated the onlooker's mind and eye.</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_221"><font color="GREEN">221</font></a> There he abode for a day's rest; in the evening hour with the grace of a lion he went to the bo-tree.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_222"><font color="GREEN">222</font></a> Along the great road, beset with Brahmas, gods, and Titans, with serpents and roc-birds, went the ruler of man. A highborn Brahmin, laden with grass, beholding him, gave him a handful of grass.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_223"><font color="GREEN">223</font></a> There the skies were flowering with lovely blue lotus and water lilies, birds thronging like rain-drops, as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_224"><font color="GREEN">224</font></a> The skies were full of all manner of sweet scents, and the odour of sandal wood and fragrant powders, as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_225"><font color="GREEN">225</font></a> The skies were full of fair jewelled sunshades and glorious golden banners as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_226"><font color="GREEN">226</font></a> The skies were filled with gods also, sporting and waving thousands of shawls as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_227"><font color="GREEN">227</font></a> The skies were filled with gods also, playing upon thousands of divine drums and instruments of musick, as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_228"><font color="GREEN">228</font></a> The skies were filled with fair goddesses, singing all manner of songs, as the chief of men passed by.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_229"><font color="GREEN">229</font></a> Lovely fays and fairy maidens, lovely serpents and their mates, kept up their lovely dances and songs.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_230"><font color="GREEN">230</font></a> Thus, amidst all these festivities, like a flood, the glorious sole ruler of the three worlds, grass in hand, approached the bo-tree.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_231"><font color="GREEN">231</font></a> The chief of men made a circuit rightwise about the bo-tree, which was like a lofty hill of silver set on a black coral rock,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_232"><font color="GREEN">232</font></a> and stood facing the east, the wise one, on the firm plot of earth where sin was to be destroyed, and scattered the handfuls of grass.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_233"><font color="GREEN">233</font></a> Then this seat became fourteen cubits long. Then, seeing this wonder, the supremely wise one thought:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_234"><font color="GREEN">234</font></a> 'Let my flesh, blood, and bones, sinews and skin, indeed be dried up, yet shall I not lose my power.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_235"><font color="GREEN">235</font></a> The great hero and chief of men then seated himself in the invincible seat, and there remained facing the east.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_236"><font color="GREEN">236</font></a> Then Sakka bronght to the God of gods a great conch, more than twenty cubits long, and stood there blowing into it.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_237"><font color="GREEN">237</font></a> Next the great Brahma Sahampati stood there in
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 49------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a>
 
 
 
  comely wise, upholding a white sunshade of three leagues in extent, like another full moon.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_238"><font color="GREEN">238</font></a> Suyāma, chief of gods, with a fair yak's-tail whisk three leagues long, stood there fanning him gently.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_239"><font color="GREEN">239</font></a> The god named Pañcasikha stood there playing upon a lute of vilva wood, capable of many melodies.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_240"><font color="GREEN">240</font></a> Kāla also, King of Serpents, stood there singing songs of praise, attended by dancers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_241"><font color="GREEN">241</font></a> Two-and-thirty nymphs, with a golden shrine filled with flowers, stood in attitudes of devotion.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_242"><font color="GREEN">242</font></a> Whilst Indra and the companies of gods thus kept festivity, Māra the Sinner thought thus to himself:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_243"><font color="GREEN">243</font></a> 'This prince desires to escape from my dominion: well, I will make Siddhattha no Siddhattha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_244"><font color="GREEN">244</font></a> He then created a thousand great and horrible arms, and with them seized all manner of gleaming weapons; he mounted upon his magnificent and fierce elephant, a hundred and fifty leagues high, named Girimekhala.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_245"><font color="GREEN">245</font></a> He then, attended by an army provided with all manner of weapons; having many mouths, with flame-coloured hair, and great round protruding red eyes, their mouths awful, snakes issuing from their breasts,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_246"><font color="GREEN">246</font></a> thither he came, roaring with a fearful sound: 'Seize you Siddhattha, and bind him!' Such was their command. At the sight, the assembly of gods was scattered, like flecks of cotton blown by a violent wind.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_247"><font color="GREEN">247</font></a> Then Death created a harsh sound like deep thunder, and a wind; but he could not so much as move a corner of the fair robe of that blessed one.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_248"><font color="GREEN">248</font></a> Then he caused to descend a horrible and terrific rain, swift as that which falls at the destruction of an age; but could not make one drop come near to the incomparable one. Seeing that wonder, the foul-mouthed one,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_249"><font color="GREEN">249</font></a> with a great and blazing conflagration of fire, showered down rocks, ashes and mud, weapons, and fiery coals, and sand; but all these things,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_250"><font color="GREEN">250</font></a> by Māra's power precipitated from the sky, when they came nigh to him of transcendent merit, became like garlands of flowers. He then created a horrible black darkness, like that</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_251"><font color="GREEN">251</font></a> of limbo; but by the splendour of his beautiful body, the darkness of delusion was turned into lovely and
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 50------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a>
 
 
 
  glorious light, like the sun in his radiance. Seeing this, the Evil One,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_252"><font color="GREEN">252</font></a> his face inflamed with anger, his eyebrows twitching, his dress in hideous disorder, bearing the disc-weapon,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_253"><font color="GREEN">253</font></a> exceeding sharp, like a knife, which would cut through even the noble King Meru like a thick sprout. This he cast at the mine of virtue, but it could do him no harm; but in a moment, as it passed through the air, became a canopy over his head.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_254"><font color="GREEN">254</font></a> Rocky peaks, blazing with fire, thrown by the host, passing through the air became, as it were, a mass of garlands.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_255"><font color="GREEN">255</font></a> Seeing this also, the miserable creature approached the hero, and said: 'This invincible seat is mine;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_256"><font color="GREEN">256</font></a> rise up from this seat.' Thus answered the wise one: 'Who is</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_257"><font color="GREEN">257</font></a> witness, Māra, that the seat is thine by reason of good deeds done?' The Sinful One replied, 'All these are witnesses,' stretching out his hand towards the host.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_258"><font color="GREEN">258</font></a> And the host, with horrid voice, exclaimed: 'I am witness! I am witness!' Having thus caused them to declare that they were witnesses, he went on:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_259"><font color="GREEN">259</font></a> 'Who is thy witness, Siddhattha?' Then the incomparable replied: 'My witnesses, Māra, are not sentient beings.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_260"><font color="GREEN">260</font></a> Thrusting out from his brilliant red robe his right hand, shining like golden lightning,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_261"><font color="GREEN">261</font></a> he pointed to the earth and said: 'Why didst thou cry out at the place of perfection, and art now silent?' Then from the earth</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_262"><font color="GREEN">262</font></a> came forth hundreds of sounds like the sound of thunder. Clasping his clever and strong elephant close with his knees,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_263"><font color="GREEN">263</font></a> on seeing this, he thought, 'Now he will catch us! now he will catch us!' and like a serpent with broken fangs, crestfallen and subdued,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_264"><font color="GREEN">264</font></a> away he fled, with his host, even to the Cakkavāla Rock, leaving weapons, clothes, ornaments, and everything, all scattered about.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_265"><font color="GREEN">265</font></a> Then the company of the gods, seeing Māra's host in fear and misery fleeing away, exclaimed: 'Behold the defeat of Māra! Victory to Prince Siddhattha!'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_266"><font color="GREEN">266</font></a> Rejoicing, they worshipt the hero with oblations of sweet perfumes and scents, and returning, sang together in hymns of praise, clad in festal array.</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_267"><font color="GREEN">267</font></a> Thus did the mighty hero, sitting upon the immovable seat, scatter the host of Māra while the sun was still high.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_268"><font color="GREEN">268</font></a> In the first watch, the supreme one obtained knowledge of former existences, in the middle watch divine insight,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_269"><font color="GREEN">269</font></a> and then in the last watch he went through the Chain of Causation, until he grasped that knowledge thoroughly.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_270"><font color="GREEN">270</font></a> At dawn, all the hundred systems of worlds shouted together. Becoming Buddha all-wise, he of the lotus-eyes, all wise,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_271"><font color="GREEN">271</font></a> he uttered this hymn of praise, moved with joy (sādiso?), 'I have traversed a succession of many births'; and so forth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_272"><font color="GREEN">272</font></a> Then, perceiving the many virtues of that seat, he said: 'I shall not yet arise from this seat.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_273"><font color="GREEN">273</font></a> The Teacher achieved the Attainment in millions of phases, sitting there for seven days on the unshaken seat.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_274"><font color="GREEN">274-5</font></a><a name="pp_275"></a> There arose a doubt in the minds of certain gods, who thought: 'The glorious Siddhattha must have some other duty to perform, that is why he does not leave this seat.' Perceiving their thought, and desiring to set their minds at rest,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_276"><font color="GREEN">276</font></a> the Ruler uprose like a golden pheasant, gold-coloured, light-giving, and ascending into the air, he worked a wonder.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_277"><font color="GREEN">277</font></a> When by this means he had fully reassured the minds of the gods, for seven days he stood with unwinking lotus-eyes venerating the bo-tree and the seat of victory.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_278"><font color="GREEN">278</font></a> Then, walking up and down in the noble arcade, bright with gems, like a storehouse of precious things, the pure one investigated the pure doctrine.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_279"><font color="GREEN">279</font></a> Then beneath the noble ajapāla-tree he caused the pure lotus-faces of Māra's women to fade, and beneath the mucalinda-tree he caused the serpent-King's thoughts to expand like lotus-blossoms,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_280"><font color="GREEN">280</font></a> and beneath the rājāyatana-tree, the wise one, so fair in hue, gave himself up to the uninterrupted enjoyment of Attainment for nine-and-forty days.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_281"><font color="GREEN">281</font></a> He then used the water of Anotatta, a tooth-cleaner of betel-vine, and the goodly myrobolan drug brought by the King of the gods.</p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_282"><font color="GREEN">282</font></a> He received from the merchants a cake of strong honey, presented by the Kings in a leaf.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_283"><font color="GREEN">283</font></a> At the end of the repast, he went beneath the ajapāla-tree, and pondered on the profundity of the truth to which he had attained,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_284"><font color="GREEN">284</font></a> saying, 'This truth which I have attained to is profound and calm as the mass of water supporting the earth,' and so forth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_285"><font color="GREEN">285</font></a> 'This profundity of truth has been comprehended by me, the King of truth, through reasoning and exercise of memory.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_286"><font color="GREEN">286</font></a> 'In the endeavour, I gave to a beggar's petition even my noble head adorned with a crown, which I cut off;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_287"><font color="GREEN">287</font></a> 'my anointed eyes, which I pluckt out; blood which I drew from my neck; my beautiful wife;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_288"><font color="GREEN">288</font></a> 'my children, who are like a lamp to the family: no gift that I gave not, no observance that I did not fulfil.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_289"><font color="GREEN">289</font></a> 'Thus in former births, as the Saṅkhapāla, I sacrificed my very life for fear of some breach of observance.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_290"><font color="GREEN">290</font></a> 'In the Khantivāda birth and others, no single perfection but has been attained by me in cutting off what was to be cut off.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_291"><font color="GREEN">291</font></a> 'When I scattered the host of Māra the earth did not quake, nor when I remembered my former existence,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_292"><font color="GREEN">292</font></a> 'nor in the middle watch, when I obtained divine insight; but quake it did in the last watch,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_293"><font color="GREEN">293</font></a> 'when I obtained comprehension of the causes of existence; and it uttered a loud noise as it were giving approval.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_294"><font color="GREEN">294</font></a> 'As a gourd full of rice gruel, as a chatty full of buttermilk, as a hand smeared over with salve, as a cloth washed in grease:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_295"><font color="GREEN">295</font></a> 'so this world is a mine of ignorance, filled with a mass of sin, polluted, inflamed with lust, miserable with pain, infatuate with mighty delusion.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_296"><font color="GREEN">296</font></a> 'What comprehends this doctrine? what use is there to teach it?' Thus the Lord became despondent about giving the immortal drink of doctrine to mankind.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_297"><font color="GREEN">297</font></a> Thereupon Brahma Sahampati uttered a great cry, saying: 'Alas! the world is perishing, truly the world is lost!'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_298"><font color="GREEN">298</font></a> Then from the hundreds of world-systems he assembled throngs of Brahmas and gods, and with them came before the Teacher.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_299"><font color="GREEN">299</font></a> He kneeled upon his knee in that place, and folded his hands upon his head, crying: 'Let the Blessed One declare the Law.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_300"><font color="GREEN">300</font></a> At his request, the conqueror, omniscient, lotus-lipped, beheld with his divine eye the hundreds of world-systems,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_301"><font color="GREEN">301</font></a> and then, seeing how few mortals there were whose lusts were small, he divided them into two parts by the principle of good and evil:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_302"><font color="GREEN">302</font></a> rejecting the evil, he assembled the good by his wisdom, and said: 'Let each person now bring his own vessel of faith:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_303"><font color="GREEN">303</font></a> 'I will fill it with this immortal gift of gospel.' He sent forth upon the company of Brahma rays of words divine.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_304"><font color="GREEN">304</font></a> Then the bright one rose over the ajapāla-tree like the sun of wisdom rising in the sky over the eastern mountain, and shining bright like the light of jewels, emitted bright rays of wisdom.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_305"><font color="GREEN">305-7</font></a><a name="pp_306"></a><a name="pp_307"></a> Then, gladdening Upaka and others, the glorious ascetic passed along the road eighteen leagues in length, by the flowering trees, to the incomparable deerpark, filled continually with the humming of swarms of busy bees, and the murmurs of many a bird, perfumed with the scent of full-blown lotus; then the Five Brahmins, seeing the god of gods, the ruler of the three existences, who sees to the ends of the world, the Blest One, the fair-limbed, the hero, the sage, the lion-king, devised this evil plot.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_308"><font color="GREEN">308</font></a> 'Friends, here comes this ascetic, golden-hued, perfect in shape, after a meal of rich food and drink. Let us make no kind of salutation to him;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_309"><font color="GREEN">309</font></a> 'but this honourable personage, born of a high stock, like a banner upon the earth, is worthy to receive a seat; therefore let us prepare a seat for him.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_310"><font color="GREEN">310</font></a> The Blessed One thus perceiving their design by his keen wisdom, by the power of his kindness conquered their arrogance, like a banner blown down by the wind.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_311"><font color="GREEN">311</font></a> Unable to resist his words, they did all obeisance to the wise Ruler of the World.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_312"><font color="GREEN">312</font></a> But the sages, not knowing that this Prince of Sages

  was Buddha, addrest him simply by the name of 'Friend.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_313"><font color="GREEN">313</font></a> Then the Ruler of the World, who knows the world, said unto them, 'Call not the Teacher simply by the name of Friend;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_314"><font color="GREEN">314</font></a> 'For, Brethren, the Tathāgata is the Saint, the Buddha All-knowing.' When the Supreme One had made known to them that he was Buddha,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_315"><font color="GREEN">315</font></a> sitting upon the most noble seat which they had prepared, he adorned those Elders with the ornament of virtue with a voice like Brahma's voice,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_316"><font color="GREEN">316</font></a> and, attended by millions of Brahmas, set the Wheel of the Law in motion, and by the rays of his discourse</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_317"><font color="GREEN">317</font></a> he also dispersed the pall of dark ignorance in the world, and by his lotus-like wisdom showed forth the lovely light of truth to those who could be converted;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_318"><font color="GREEN">318</font></a> thus like a King of great might, the King of Truth most wise, in the field of victory called the Deer-forest,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_319"><font color="GREEN">319</font></a> grasping the goodly sword of preaching with the hand of wisdom, caused continued loss to the kindred of those ripe for conversion.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_320"><font color="GREEN">320</font></a> He destroyed sins, he beat the drums of victory, true religion, the flag of victory, true religion, hard to win;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_321"><font color="GREEN">321</font></a> he uplifted, he planted the auspicious pillar of victory, true religion, and became sole King of the world, the source of bliss;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_322"><font color="GREEN">322</font></a> he delivered the people from the mighty bond of transmigration, desiring to lead them to the city of Nirvāna, longing to do good to the world.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_323"><font color="GREEN">323</font></a> Reaching the road leading to Uruvela, like a road divine, fair to behold as a moving mountain of gold,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_324"><font color="GREEN">324</font></a> he gave to some thirty Bhaddavaggiya princes the excellent, immortal draught of the Three Paths;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_325"><font color="GREEN">325</font></a> then, supreme in wisdom, having conferred the excellent gift of ordination, he sent them forth Brethren for the world's good, saying, 'Go on your pilgrimage.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_326"><font color="GREEN">326</font></a> He proceeded to Uruvela, cutting off the matted hair of the ascetics without and within. Then, reaching the highroad, he, pre-eminent, as the moon is attended by stars,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_327"><font color="GREEN">327</font></a> so attended by these persons, free from sin, shining with six-coloured rays of light, he shed splendour

  upon those fair women the points of the compass, and delighted the eyes of birds.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_328"><font color="GREEN">328</font></a> Then he remembered the promise given to the glorious King Bimbisāra, like a banner to a noble royal lineage, abode of virtues; and desiring to fulfil it,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_329"><font color="GREEN">329</font></a> at the time of the peacocks' dance he went to the park called Laṭṭhivana, adorned with plantations of all manner of trees.</p>

 <p><a name="pp_331"><font color="GREEN">331</font></a> entered that park, attended by his great councillors, made glorious with his hair the lotus-feet of the Teacher.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_332"><font color="GREEN">332-3</font></a><a name="pp_333"></a> The other, sitting, bright with beauty, of excellent beauty, to whom the King of the gods did sing, worshipt by gods, Titans, and serpent Kings, glorious, (presented) Bimbisāra with the immortal draught of the true doctrine. Then to lovely Rājagaha he went, a city like that of the King of the gods,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_334"><font color="GREEN">334</font></a> and the mighty man was led by the King to the King's house. At the end of his repast, shaking the great earth,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_335"><font color="GREEN">335</font></a> he took the fair road to the lovely Veluvana Park, beautiful with lordly trees in full bloom,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_336"><font color="GREEN">336</font></a> and on a plot of earth beautified by being hidden under a quantity of white sand, filled with gentle waftings of fragrant flowers, adorned with tanks covered with all kinds of twining lotus, a wide clear place, a bower of creepers,</p>

 <p><a name="pp_338"><font color="GREEN">338</font></a> after performing a multitude of pure observances, uplifting the brilliant sceptre of tranquillity, brandishing the excellent sharp arrow of a Buddha's knowledge, he dwelt at ease in the supreme hermitage.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_339"><font color="GREEN">339</font></a> Then King Suddhodana, having heard that his own son had attained to supreme knowledge, and had set rolling the wheel of the Law for the world's good,</p>

 <p><a name="pp_342"><font color="GREEN">342</font></a> These came and heard the incomparable preaching of the King of Truth, and obtaining the supreme good, did not send back so much as a message.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_343"><font color="GREEN">343</font></a> The King, not seeing a single one of them, sent for a great minister, the orator Kāludāyi, who ever delighted in asceticism.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_344"><font color="GREEN">344</font></a> To him he said: 'Bring me my son, my precious jewel, by any means, and make a salve for my sore eyes.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_345"><font color="GREEN">345</font></a> Then with a thousand soldiers he sent him also, and he came with his company and heard the Master's beautiful preaching,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_346"><font color="GREEN">346</font></a> and entering upon the path to sainthood, he renounced the world, honouring the mighty man, the omniscient, by laying his folded hands on his head.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_347"><font color="GREEN">347</font></a> and <a name="pp_352"><font color="GREEN">352</font></a> Then he said: 'Lord, it is time to go to the fine royal city named Kapila, filled with men of boundless wealth'; and he described the journey. Red shoots and creepers most beautiful grow in the springtime, trees with lovely branches and bright green leaves upon them,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_348"><font color="GREEN">348</font></a> 'with all manner of excellent flowers bursting into bloom and exhaling sweet odours; there are goodly forests filled with the voices of hosts of birds and beasts,</p>

 <p><a name="pp_356"><font color="GREEN">356</font></a> Clad in a cloak of red, the Buddha, like a moving Mount Meru of gold, like a pure full moon surrounded by stars,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_357"><font color="GREEN">357</font></a> he moved twenty thousand souls, all peace at heart like himself, full of bliss, and along his journey of sixty leagues</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_358"><font color="GREEN">358</font></a> day by day he halted, the conqueror, league by league, and in two months reached the noble city of his birth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_359"><font color="GREEN">359</font></a> The Buddha, with bright and pure lotus-face, shining like the rays of the new-risen sun, his wide feet marked with discs, the abode of good doing, sole refuge of the three worlds, with body supreme and unconquered,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_360"><font color="GREEN">360</font></a> was worshipt by Suddhodana and other royal personages with golden vessels filled with wreaths of sweet perfume, with drums, lutes, and tabors, with goodly canopies, whisks, and fans.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_361"><font color="GREEN">361-3</font></a><a name="pp_362"></a><a name="pp_363"></a> Reaching the fair-adorned city, the chief of sages entered the noble, pre-eminent Nigrodha monastery, provided with beautiful cloisters, terraces, and bowers of creepers, resplendent with lakes of wholesome water covered with blossoming lotus, enlivened by the sporting of flocks of peacocks, the earth one mass of fragrant flowers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_364"><font color="GREEN">364</font></a> The Sākiya, with minds full of stubbornness, thought, 'This Siddhattha is our son, our grandson,'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_365"><font color="GREEN">365</font></a> and thus they spake to the younger princes one by one: 'Do you greet Siddhattha; no greeting give we.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_366"><font color="GREEN">366</font></a> This said, they sat down, putting the younger ones forward. Then the one eye of the three worlds, the tranquil subduer of the untranquil,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_367"><font color="GREEN">367</font></a> knowing their thought, said: 'My kinsfolk give me no greeting: very well, I shall make them greet me.' Immediately</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_368"><font color="GREEN">368</font></a> entering upon the transcendent meditation of supernatural knowledge, and arising from his trance like a golden goose, the Illuminator</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_369"><font color="GREEN">369-70</font></a><a name="pp_370"></a> rose into the air; and there the supreme sage performed a glorious unparalleled miracle, unrivalled by others, like the miracle done beneath the gaṇḍamba-tree.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_371"><font color="GREEN">371</font></a> When the King saw this miracle, Suddhodana the mighty, sole ruler of the Sākiya race, filled with joy

  and bliss, he made all his bright hair beautiful by placing upon it the Teacher's lotus-feet; and all the Sākiyas did likewise.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_372"><font color="GREEN">372-4</font></a><a name="pp_373"></a><a name="pp_374"></a> The wise one, after a shower of rain, showered down the rain of the Truth, washing away the great ignorance from men's hearts; then on the following day, with his company, he entered the excellent city to beg from house to house.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_375"><font color="GREEN">375</font></a> Wherever he stept, lotus flowers sprang up, and received his lotus-feet pace by pace.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_376"><font color="GREEN">376</font></a> and <a name="pp_378"><font color="GREEN">378</font></a> Then Yasodharā, standing on a fine terrace of the delightful palace, full of love, saw from a window gates and pinnacles, houses and watch-towers, all yellow by the rays from his body, and</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_377"><font color="GREEN">377</font></a> beheld the hero walking for alms in the street, wise, calm, giving light, enlightener of the world;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_379"><font color="GREEN">379</font></a> and addressing the noble Rāhula, adorned and glittering with jewelled rays, said to him: 'That is thy father,' pointing him out.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_380"><font color="GREEN">380</font></a> She went to the house of the noble Suddhodana, attended by many waiting-women, and said, with respectful greeting;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_381"><font color="GREEN">381</font></a> 'Sire, thy son, who formerly walked this city with the grace of a King of gods, now walks from house to house seeking alms.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_382"><font color="GREEN">382</font></a> This said, she went to her own house, her large eyes filled with abundance of the water of joy.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_383"><font color="GREEN">383</font></a> Then the King of all other Kings, adorned like Indra, trembling, went in haste to meet the Conqueror, saying:</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_384"><font color="GREEN">384</font></a> 'O chief of the Sākyas, this is not the custom of thy family; walk not, walk not; O my son, never before has a King of our family trudged for alms.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_385"><font color="GREEN">385</font></a> When the lord of men had thus said, the great sage replied, the chaplet of virtues: 'This is thy family, O great King; mine is the family of the Buddha.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_386"><font color="GREEN">386</font></a> Thus he declared the Buddha's family, and standing in the same spot, declared the gospel,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_387"><font color="GREEN">387</font></a> uttering this supreme and beautiful verse, which brought happiness to the hearers: 'One should not neglect the law . . .,' etc.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_388"><font color="GREEN">388</font></a> Then the supreme one, after satisfying him by the gift of the choice flower of doctrine, at his request went on to his house.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_389"><font color="GREEN">389</font></a> The Lord of the Earth and twenty thousand like-minded

  with him, having satisfied the chief of men with the well of sweetness,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_390"><font color="GREEN">390</font></a> greeted him with other royal personages with rays of crested gems and folded yellow hands, sat down by the Conqueror.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_391"><font color="GREEN">391</font></a> Hundreds of fair royal women also, by permission of the lord of man, sat down there also.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_392"><font color="GREEN">392</font></a> The Conqueror, the tilaka-spot of the three worlds, after preaching the sweet doctrine, thought: 'If this day I do not go to the house of Bimbā</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_393"><font color="GREEN">393</font></a> her heart will break with sorrow.' Thus thinking, the abode of compassion went with his father to the house, taking a couple of the chief disciples.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_394"><font color="GREEN">394</font></a> Entering, the Buddha sat down upon the Buddha's seat, shining like the sun with the glory of the six-coloured rays.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_395"><font color="GREEN">395</font></a> Bimbā approached the Teacher, bright with rays which shone from her body like vermilion powder, with lips like bimbā fruit, trembling like a golden creeper.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_396"><font color="GREEN">396</font></a> The Teacher, by the touch of his foot, extinguisht the great grief in her heart, as extinguishing a fire on the hearth by excellent cool water.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_397"><font color="GREEN">397</font></a> The King told the Teacher the great excellence of Bimbā, and the chief of sages related the Candakisnara Birth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_398"><font color="GREEN">398</font></a> Then the three festivals of Prince Nanda having come, marriage, ceremonial sprinkling, and entering on the house,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_399"><font color="GREEN">399</font></a> the Illuminator ordained him even before the festivals, having brought him, though unwilling, to the beautiful monastery;</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_400"><font color="GREEN">400</font></a> and when his own son, Prince Rāhala, followed him for the sake of an inheritance, shining with princely splendour,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_401"><font color="GREEN">401</font></a> and crying in a pleasant voice, 'Grateful is thy shadow to save,' and 'Give me an inheritance, give me an inheritance,'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_402"><font color="GREEN">402</font></a> him also he ordained, and brought him to the incomparable monastery. Thus the Wise One gave him an inheritance, by giving him the treasure of pure religion.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_403"><font color="GREEN">403</font></a> Thence departing, Sagata, the Sun, with the rays of pure religion, causing men in this place and that to blossom like the lotus, arrived at Rājagaha. Moreover,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_404"><font color="GREEN">404</font></a> Sargata dwells in fair Sītavana, having spacious

 <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a>
 
 
 
  cloisters adorned with white sand, and parks of beautiful trees laden with flowers, and multitudes of lakes shining with blue lotus.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_405"><font color="GREEN">405</font></a> Then the famous merchant named Sudatta, taking carts laden with much goods, came from Sāvatthi to beautiful Rājagaha, to the house of the rich merchant Sahāya.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_406"><font color="GREEN">406</font></a> This kindly person told him that the Buddha was born in the world, lord of men; and in the delight and joy of his heart he thought, 'The night has become light.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_407"><font color="GREEN">407</font></a> Departing thence, the darkness being dispelled on the highroad by the power of the gods, he proceeded to lovely Sītavana.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_408"><font color="GREEN">408</font></a> When he beheld the Great Sage, shining like the full moon, giving out light like a blazing tree, rejoicing the eyes, he touched with his head the fair colour of the Buddha's foot.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_409"><font color="GREEN">409</font></a> Then, wise with hearing the doctrine, profound, abstruse, glorious, pure, he attained the fruit of the First Path, beautiful a thousand fold.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_410"><font color="GREEN">410</font></a> Having invited the Supreme Buddha and his company, ruler of the world, he offered a gift full of happiness, endowed with colour, scent, and taste.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_411"><font color="GREEN">411</font></a> He obtained the Teacher's promise to come to the noble city of Sāvatthi; and departing, on the way,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_412"><font color="GREEN">412</font></a> league by league, he bestowed great wealth, and caused to be made goodly monasteries resplendent with paintings.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_413"><font color="GREEN">413</font></a> Reaching Sāvatthi again, with its hundreds of palaces, fair with garlanded arches, walls, and gates,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_414"><font color="GREEN">414</font></a> which seemed even to rival the very city of the King of gods, full of all prosperity, merry with dancing and song,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_415"><font color="GREEN">415</font></a> he looked about him on all sides for a site worthy of a monastery, wherein should dwell the Blessed One, lord of the earth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_416"><font color="GREEN">416</font></a> He espied a spot of ground where was shade, and water, and all else deairable, a park of Prince Jeta like to Nandana.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_417"><font color="GREEN">417</font></a> The glorious one bought this for a crore of gold pieces, for the Teacher's sake alone. There in that noble place, charming the minds of men and gods,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_418"><font color="GREEN">418</font></a> he caused to be made a large and noble perfumed chamber, painted, like a crown of the earth, fair with all flowers, beauteous with variegated canopies,
 
 
 
 <!------------------------page 61------------------------>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a>
 
 
 
 its roofs adorned with strings of pearls and all sorts of jewels, surmounted with peaklike pinnacles, ever alive with rows of bells, all tinkling.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_419"><font color="GREEN">419-21</font></a><a name="pp_420"></a><a name="pp_421"></a> For the Conqueror's children also the merchant had made a spacious abode, the fair and noble monastery called Jetavana, furnisht with canopies and beds, adorned with bowers and cloisters, ever charming the mind and eyes, ornamented with blossoming trees of many a kind, having tanks filled with most cool and wholesome water, and covered with sweet-scented water-lilies and lotus, having beautiful wide terraces supplied with benches, and soft pure white sand.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_422"><font color="GREEN">422</font></a> Like the wide mountain Kelāsa, protected by the excellent and beautiful rampart of the Serpent King, helpful to all believers, this monastery shines, a very magic gem.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_423"><font color="GREEN">423</font></a> Then Anāthapiṇḍika sent a message to the chief of sages that he might come. The Teacher, on hearing the messenger's words,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_424"><font color="GREEN">424</font></a> with a large company of Brethren, set forth, and in due time came to Sāvatthi the incomparable.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_425"><font color="GREEN">425</font></a> A number of handsome princes bearing flags went before the Teacher, like gods.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_426"><font color="GREEN">426</font></a> Behind them came lovely young women, like virgins divine, bearing full pitchers, and in like manner,</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_427"><font color="GREEN">427</font></a> bearing a full bowl, the merchant's wife, adorned with many ornaments.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_428"><font color="GREEN">428</font></a> The great merchant himself, with hundreds of rich merchants, approached the Lord, the great hero, to whom they did homage in various ways.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_429"><font color="GREEN">429</font></a> So Sagata the beautiful, chief of sages, was brought to the golden-coloured city, shining with the delightful six-coloured rays, and entered the monastery of Jetavana.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_430"><font color="GREEN">430</font></a> 'I give this monastery to the Supreme Buddha with the oecumenical order,' said the merchant, as upon the Teacher's lovely lotus-hands</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_431"><font color="GREEN">431</font></a> he poured from a golden pitcher choice scented water, and so he presented the beautiful picturesque monastery.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_432"><font color="GREEN">432-3</font></a><a name="pp_433"></a> Having accepted the lovely and noble monastery, the King of Kings, the one eye of the three worlds, the glorious Teacher, the benevolent sage, sitting on the priceless decorated seat, preached to the merchant called Sudatta, to that lord (?) the great

 benefit, delightful, bringing joy to the three worlds, in the giving of monasteries, and of gifts to the helpless.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_434"><font color="GREEN">434</font></a> What man, save the all-wise one, the sole protector of the three worlds, even though he have thousands of mouths, is able to declare the great benefit which there is in the giving of monasteries?</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_435"><font color="GREEN">435</font></a> Thus the far-famed one, having discoursed to him, gladdening at the same time the hearts of all men, spent his days going here and there, beating the great drum of the Law with an exceeding sweet sound.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_436"><font color="GREEN">436</font></a> I shall now recite the list of places frequented by he who gives happiness to the three worlds, the all-compassionate, supreme in the worlds, worshipt by gods, Titans, great Serpents, demons, and other creatures.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_437"><font color="GREEN">437</font></a> In the first season, the noble Conqueror, like a sun, causing believers to unfold like lotus flowers under the shining rays of religion, dwelt in the Deer Park in Benares City.</p>

 <p><a name="pp_439"><font color="GREEN">439</font></a> In the fifth season the Lion Sakyamuni made his abode in the great wood near the lovely city, well-known under the name of Vesāli, brilliant with the jewelled aigrettes of kings.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_440"><font color="GREEN">440</font></a> In the sixth season, the Buddha, store of infinite virtues, dwelt on the great mountain of Manikala, illuminating it with delicate golden light, his lovely eyes like blue lotus flowers bursting into bloom.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_441"><font color="GREEN">441</font></a> In the seventh season, the incomparable sage, living an auspicious life, made his abode in the cool and spacious rocky seat of the King of the gods, preaching to the gods his doctrine, sweet, profound, and difficult to comprehend.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_442"><font color="GREEN">442</font></a> In the eighth season, the supreme Conqueror of Māra, the abode of good conduct, whose feet were as the full-blown lotus, made his abode in the delightful wood of Bhesakalā, on the mountain named Hill Su"msumāra.</p>

 destroyed many a heresy, and the pride of heretics and serpents, made his abode in the Kosambī silk-cotton wood, most beautiful and fair to see.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><a name="pp_444"><font color="GREEN">444</font></a> In the tenth season, the noble sage, to pacify the bitter quarrel of the priests by means of the noble elephant, made his abode in goodly Pāraleyya, the spacious pine-grove filled with flowers.</p>
