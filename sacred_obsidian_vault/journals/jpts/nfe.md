 <p>   THE following is a translation of the Tibetan version of <i>Nâgârjuna</i>'s letter to King <i>Udayana</i>,<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> first mentioned by Max Müller in the Journal for 1883, p. 72 ff., where a translation of the first eight verses from the Chinese is given. As might have been concluded at once from the note, quoted there, of <i>I-tsi"n</i>, one of the translators of our letter into Chinese (see about him M.M.'s "Renaissance of Sanscrit Literature"), viz., that it was learnt by heart as an introduction to religious instruction, we find that its 123 verses contain, in fact, a short exposition of the principal doctrines. Most of the dogmatical terms used or mentioned here are to be found likewise in the <i>Dharmasa.mgraha</i> (published in Anecdota Ononiensia, Aryan Series V., Oxford, 1885), which also is brought into connection with <i>Nâgârjuna</i>. Chiefly we may mention: Verse 4--the <i>Anusm.rtayas</i> = Dharmas. 54; v. 5--the ten <i>Virtues</i>, Dh. 67; v. 8--the six Pâramitâs, Dh. 17; v. 29--the eight <i>Lokadharma's</i>, Dh. 61; v. 40--the <i>Brahmavihâra's</i>, Dh. 16; v. 41--the four <i>Dhyâna's</i>, Dh. 72; v. 45--the five <i>Indriya's</i> or <i>Bala's</i>, Dh. 47, 48; v. 49, 50--the five <i>Skandha's</i>, Dh. 22; v. 52, 53,</p>

 105--the three <i>Çiksha's</i>, Dh. 140; v. 63, 64--the eight <i>Aksha.na's</i>, Dh. 134; v. 77-88--the eight (hot) hells, Dh. 121; v. 89-103--the other <i>states of rebirth</i>, Dh. 57; v. 106--the <i>Bodhya.nga's</i>, Dh. 49; v.108--the Avyâk.rtavastûni, Dh. 137; v. 109-111--the <i>Pratîtyasamutpâda</i>, Dh. 42; v. 113--the <i>Eightfold Path</i>, Dh. 50; v. 114--the <i>Four Truths</i>, Dh. 21.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> In the same volume of the Tanjur (ff. 321-364) we find a commentary on our letter, composed by one <i>Blo-gros-chen-po = Mahâmati</i>, from which I give only the more interesting parts. Besides this, I have pointed out some striking coincidences with other Buddhist and Sanscrit works, principally the <i>Dhammapada</i> and its Tibetan compeer, the <i>Udânavarga</i>; the <i>Hdsa"n-blun</i>, "Der Weise und der Thor," ed. by I. J. Schmidt, where some tales of the <i>Divyâvadâna</i> appear in a shorter form; and that large storehouse of Indian wisdom, Böhtlingk's "Indische Sprüche." Other quotations are rare. For the Tibetan translations of the theological terms I have usually substituted their Sanscrit originals as far as they were known to me, and as far as they were not to be found in the Dharmasa.mgraha in the same order. Perhaps it may not be superfluous to remark here that a <i>transliteration</i> of Sanscrit words (in Tibetan characters) only occurs in the following places: v. 20, <i>am-ra</i> (<i>sic</i>); v. 23, <i>kim-pa</i>; v. 43, <i>ga"ngâ</i>; in the commentary on v. 80, <i>çal-ma-li</i>, and the translator's name at the end.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   Regarding the author of our letter, <i>Nâgârjuna</i> (<i>Klu-sgrub</i>), it is known that he was the renowned founder of the <i>Mahâyâna</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the later philosophical development of Buddhism, especially the school of the <i>Mâdhyamika's</i>. As the typical representative of the whole of later Buddhism, he soon became the subject of many legends, that are</p>
 
 
 
 <small></small><p>[1. From the circumstance that our author leaves unmentioned certain categories that one wight expect--as, for instance, his enumerating only six <i>Pâramitâ's</i>--I do not think that we can conclude his not knowing them, and, consequently, his priority to their introduction, for, as the Commentator more than once rewarks, he writes for the use of a laywan (<i>khyim-pa = g.rhastha</i>), on whom these higher duties were not binding.]</p>

 to be found for the most part in Târâ.natha's history, and Wassiljew's "Buddhismus." But "of the historical Nâgârjuna we know very little" (Kern). Generally, as a contemporary of Kanishka, he is put in the first or the second century A.D.--on the authority of the Râjatara"ngi.ni, and of Târâ.natha. Anyhow, he cannot have lived much later, since the first Chinese translation of this letter is dated 431, and others of his works (at least of those that are ascribed to him) were translated as far back as 402 (s. Bunyiu Nanjio, Catalogue Col. 370 fi.). Târâ.natha, indeed, makes him live 521 or 579 years, and contemporary, not only with <i>Kâlidâsa</i> and <i>Vararuci</i>, but even with the rise of <i>Islâm</i>. For it seems quite certain that he understands this latter by the <i>Mleccha</i> faith mentioned by him on this occasion (German translation, p. 79 ff.), though Wassiljew (p. 50 note) seems inclined todoubt it.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> <i>Mohammed</i> has become <i>Mâmathar</i>, who before had been a Sautrântika of the name of <i>Kumârasena</i>;<sup><small>[2]</small></sup> the cry <i>bismillah</i> ("in the name of God")--a demon <i>Biçlimli</i> (as Schiefner has remarked), and the "Mleccha-Rshi's" are called <i>Paikhampa</i> (evidently the Persian <i>paighamber</i>, the usual translation of <i>rasûl</i>, " prophet "). Islâm, too, is aptly described as the religion of injury, persecution (<i>hthse-va</i>, Schiefner: Besinträchtigung)--the feature of the new doctrine that must strike most the charitable Buddhist.<sup><small>[3]</small></sup> With this account compare the note, p. 304 f., of Schiefner's translation, where, from some other Tibetan work, the name of the founder of Islâm is given as <i>Madhumati</i>, who had been born in the land (!) of <i>Makha</i> ( = <i>Mekka</i>), in the town of <i>Bâgadâdi</i> ( = <i>Baghdâd</i>; this shows us the way on which the news reached the informants of Târâ.natha).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   King <i>Udayana</i>, to whom the letter is addressed, is called</p>
 
 
 
 <small></small><p>[1. It is a mistake of the German translator of Wassiljew's book, when he makes him speak of a "Tibetan translation <i>of it</i>," <i>i.e</i>., of Târâ.natha's work, as if there had been an original in Sanscrit.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. Is it the same as <i>Kumâralâbha</i>, occurring shortly before? and perhaps a hit at the celebrated Kumârila?</p>

 in the Tibetan of the subscription (which evidently cannot be ascribed to the author), <i>Bde-spyod</i>. In Târâ.natha's history, where his name on the whole occurs eight times, he is generally (six times) called <i>Bde-byed</i> (viz., 57, 12. 58, 8. 59, 18. 60, 7. 67, 1), once (2, 10) <i>Bde-spyod</i>, and once (56, 17) transliterated <i>Utrayana</i>. Another king Udayana likewise is called <i>Bde-byed</i> (v. 14 of the letter, cf. Schiefner, <i>Mahâkâtjâjana</i>, etc., p. 35 ff.). <i>Bde-spyod</i> would be in Sanscrit = S<i>ukhacârin</i> (cf. <i>Dharmacârin</i> Lalitav., 249, 9 = <i>Chos-spyod</i>, Rgya 179, 22 and Schiefner's note, translation of Târ. p. 2); <i>Bde-byed</i> = Sukhakara, both of which might be taken as an explanation of the meaning of Udayana. At any rate we cannot, as Schiefner does (Târ. transl. p. 72, note 2), simply declare <i>Bde-byed</i> to be an error. It seems to me rather that the older translation of the name of Udayana, king of <i>Kauçâmbi</i>, who was born at the same time with Buddha, and later on converted by him (the one mentioned in v. 14), was <i>Hchar-byed</i> ("He who makes rise"), since he was so-called "because he shone like the image of the rising sun" (Lebensb. 235 and Rockhill, Life, p. 16, f. Note; also, Kon-tsegs v. 25 in Feer, Ann. Mus. Guim. ii. 217, and Mdo. xvi. 15, ibid., p. 262). But king Udayana ( = Sadvâhana) of Vârâ.nasî, friend of Nâgârjuna, was, it seems, properly called in Tibetan, <i>Bde-spyod</i> (which, indeed, also might express the meaning of <i>Sadvâhana</i>), and the two names, or the two explanations of the one name, were afterwards mixed up, as well as the persons themselves (v., for instance, Kern, Germ. transl., ii. p. 200 note). The king of Kauçâmbi is mentioned sometimes in "Der Weise und der Thor" (60, 13. 64, 6. 69, 2. 229,6), as <i>Utrayana</i> (<i>Uttrayana</i>). Ssanang Ssetzen, in his history of the Eastern Mongolians (14, 10. ed. Schmidt), correctly has <i>Udayana</i> (cf. Schmidt's Note, p. 313). But the confusion is not at an end here. Chandra Dâs, in the Journal As. Soc. Beng. <small>LI</small>., p. 119--I do not know on what authority--retranslates the Tibetan name <i>De-chye</i> (i.e., <i>Bde-byed</i>, according to his modern pronunciation) of Nâgârjuna's friend by <i>Camkara</i>. And, in fact, we find this translation of

 Ça.mkara, again in Târ. 3, 9 (as the name of a Brahmin), whereas shortly before (3, 6) it is, as another man's name, translated by <i>Dge-byed</i>. Likewise we have the compositions with Ça.mkara = Bde-Byed: <i>Ça.mkarapati = Bde-byed-bdag-po</i> (51, 13. 16) <i>Ça.mkara-nanda = Bde-byed-dga-va</i> (144, 8). Finally we find one <i>Udâyana = Hchar-po</i>, a Purohita of King Çuddhodana (Latitav. ch. ix. beg.), who is mentioned also in the Lebensb. 235, though with short <i>a</i> (what was here in the Tibetan text?). Compare also Eitel, Handbook s.v. Sadvaha, Udâyana and Vatsa.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   The letter appears in Tibetan in verses of 4 × 9 syllables, so that we may conclude the Sanscrit original to have been in Indravajra (as, e.g., Lalit. 30 = Rgya 38, 20 ff.). Only the last two verses (the Epilogue) count 4 × 11 syllables. The Tibetan verses generally consist of four lines of an odd number of syllables from 7 onward. Four × 7 corresponds to the Sanscrit Çloka, and is, of course, the most used (I found it, however, reproducing the Sanscrit Âryâ in Lalit. 221 = Rgya 164). Sometimes two longer lines correspond to one Sanscrit verse, as for the Âryâ in Lalit. 245, 17 ff., we find (Rgya 177, 13 ff.) 2 × 17 syll., changing afterwards to 4 × 9. Even single lines of 41 syll. are found (Rgya 186, 9 ff.) to correspond to one Sanscrit verse (Lalit. 260, 10 ff.), the Tibetans here, apparently, mistaking the whole of four verses for one verse of four lines. There is not, or has not been found out, any prosody, properly so called, in Tibetan (cf. Foucaux, grammar, 213 ff.); at most we might observe a tendency to put heavier syllables in the first part of a foot, thus giving the verse a trochaical movement.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   Fin!tlly, I may remark that the two translators of this letter aIso took part in the translation and revision of the first four voll. of the <i>Hdul-va</i> (<i>Vinaya</i>), s. Feer, l. c. p. 182, and the Ratnânanta Sûtra, ib. p. 233, in the ninth century, A.D.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   Especial thanks are due to Dr. Rost, through whose kindness I was enabled to make use of the London copy of the Tanjur.</p>

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. says that it is more difficult to find a patient man, than (a hermit) who feeds on wind, water, roots, and (raw) fruits, and dresses himself in hairs, leaves, bark, and rags, but that by bodily penance alone (<i>lus-gdu"ns-pa tsam-gyis</i>) not even a happy rebirth (<i>i.e.</i>, as man or god, s. Dharmas. 57) is to be obtained, much less (final) salvation. Anger (<i>krodha</i>) is the becoming wild and displeased if anything disagreeable is done to us by men or other beings (<i>amanushya</i>); patience (<i>kshânti</i>) is freedom from anger, and if anger should rise (in us), quieting it at once. (Cf. Böhtlingk, Sprüche, 5045.)</p>

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>.

"Shame" is the aversion to faults regarding one's-self, "carefulness" the same regarding others. (Cf. <a href="#pp_12">v. 12</a>. Udânav. x. 1 ff.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_33"><font color="GREEN">33</font></a>. Betting, looking out for crowds (as for some festival, etc.), indolence (<i>kausîdyam</i>), the company of bad men, (drinking) wine, and strolling about at night, these sins, equally known as the prevarications (<i>"nan-so"n = durgati?</i>), avoid.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. . . . "Wine" (<i>cha"n</i>) either is fabricated (<i>bcos-pa</i>) or only gathered (<i>sbyar-va</i>) <i>i.e.</i> pressed out of flowers (cf. <i>madhu</i> in the Pet.

 <p>   <a name="pp_34"><font color="GREEN">34</font></a>. The teacher of gods and men has pronounced that of all possessions contentedness is the best by far; therefore be always content, for if (you) are content, you will be rich, even if not possessing any (external: Comm.) goods.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. remarks, that contentedness is the fruit (<i>i.e.</i> end and aim) of all possession; if a poor man, therefore, be content, he has already obtained the purpose of wealth. A man is (to be called) "content," if he does not pine for the past, does not long for the future, and is not too much addicted to the present (fortunes). (Cf.

Understand that the five depravities of (groundless) joy and sorrow, malevolence, sloth (<i>styânam</i>) and sleep (at the wrong time), desire and doubt (<i>vicikîtsâ</i>) are the thieves that steal the treasure of virtue. (Five other "depravities," s. Dharm. xci.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_45"><font color="GREEN">45</font></a>. Faith, energy, recollection, meditation, and wisdom are the five best things (<i>dharma</i>); strife after these, for they are truly the highest "forces" and "qualities." (S. Dharm. 47, 48; Dhammasa"ngani, 74 ff. 95 ff.)</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_47"><font color="GREEN">47</font></a>. But if you indeed long for heaven and liberation, then entertain the true faith (<i>samyagd.rshti</i>); all men who have a wrong faith (<i>mithyâd.rshti</i>), even if their conduct is good, will (only) find a bad requital (<i>vipâka</i>).</p>

Know that a man who takes no joy in perfection (<i>samyaktva</i>) is unstable (<i>anitya</i>), soulless (<i>anâtman</i>), and unclean; and that, through want of attention (<i>sm.rtyupasthâna</i>), (he falls into) the misery of the four wrong views.</p>

If you say: I am not the form, you thereby will understand: I am not endowed with form, I do not dwell in form, the form does not dwell in me; and, in like manner, you will understand the voidness of the other four aggregates.

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. Explains <i>hdod-rgyal</i> by <i>gnam-babs</i> (?). "Time" the followers of (the doctrine of) Time (<i>dus su smra-va-rnams</i>, cf. <i>kâlakâra.nika</i> in Aufr. Cat. Oxon. 216 b. 7 f.) declare to be the cause of all growth and decay with the following words: "Time ripens what has come to existence, Time destroys the creatures, Time wakes the sleeping (<i>sic</i>!), to escape Time is difficult" (it is the verse, Böhtl., Spr. 1688). "Nature," the <i>Sâ"nkhya's</i> (<i>gra"ns-can-rnams</i>) declare to be the original cause of all things, consisting of <i>Sattva</i> (<i>sñi"n-stobs</i>), <i>Rajas</i> (<i>rdul</i>), and <i>Tamas</i> (<i>mun</i>. cf. Sarvadarçana-sa.mgraha, transl. p. 227, Manu. xii. 24 ff). The "Lord" is the fine and inconceivably soft, all-knowing, and all-doing object of meditation (<i>dhyâna</i>), for the wise meditators practised in Yoga, whose (the Lord's) body consists of sun, moon, water, fire, wind, the regions (of the sky), and ether, on whom those who long for the joy of (inner) quietude constantly meditate.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> Then follows a lengthy explanation why the Aggregates do not arise from these different causes. But, "like seed, covered with dung and watered, buds up, so, covered with ignorance and watered by desire, existence (<i>bhava</i>) arises." (Cf. <a href="#pp_110">v. 110 f.</a>)</p>

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. quotes the following words of Buddha: Bhikshus, for the living beings there is, in order to do right, to overcome pain and inconvenience, to understand the true law, and to obtain Nirvâna (only) one way that must be trod, viz., Remembrance concerning the body. (Apparently the <i>kâyânudarçam.rtyupasthânam</i>, Dharm. 44, is meant, which there has not been accurately translated.)

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The body is "consumed" if it is burned; it "dries up" if buried in the ground, by the action of wind and sun (!); it "putrefies" if, thrown into water, it is carried on by this; it becomes "unclean" if animals devour it.

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. "Land of agreement," where every one's mind is like the other's and agrees (with it). "A holy man" is a Virtuous friend (<i>kalyâ.namitra</i>) (Cf. Childers s.v.; Dhammasa"ngani, 1328.) "Wheels," that move the carriage of the sublime path. Since then you are possessed of the four, endeavour to generate in you the subl. path.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_62"><font color="GREEN">62</font></a>. Because the Muni has explained that he who leans on a Virtuous friend, will be able to lead to the end a pious life, therefore lean on a holy man, for, leaning on the Jina, you certainly will find complete rest.</p>

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. quotes a speech of the Buddha to Ânanda, wherein he says that the support of a Virtuous friend is the half of a holy life--<i>brahman</i> (<i>thsa"ns-pa</i>) is explained here by <i>Nirvâ.na</i>, and <i>brahmacarya</i> (<i>thsa"ns-par spyod-pa</i>) as the way thereto.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_63"><font color="GREEN">63</font></a>. (Adopting) wrong views, being born among the brutes, among the Pretas, or in hell, (at the time when) the law of the Jina is not (observed), in a foreign country among barbarians, being dumb and stupid (dumb and deaf?),</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_64"><font color="GREEN">64</font></a>. Or being born anywhere among the Longlived gods, these are the eight unfavourable moments; if you, freed from these, get a (favourable) moment, then exert yourself to avert (any future unfavourable) birth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <small>The <i>Aksha.na's</i> s. Dharm. 134, where Trigl. 66 (34) is forgotten. The "birth as Preta" is the same as <i>Yamalokopapatti</i>; for "if the law of the Jina is not," the Dharm. has <i>cittatpâdavirâgitatâ</i>; "dumb and stupid" (<i>glen-zhi"n lkugs-pa</i>, explained by Comm. as: one who makes signs with the hand) = Indriyavikalatâ. The "Longlived gods are the <i>Asa.mjña's</i> and the <i>Arûpa's</i>" (Dharm. 128 f.). "These eight are called <i>Aksha.na</i>, because therein you will not find rest. (Ksha.na) for the performance of virtue."</small></p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_65"><font color="GREEN">65</font></a>. O Noble one, grieved at this orb (of transmigration) which is the ground (origin) of the stings of passion, of death, illness, age, and many other pains, only hear a part of those evils.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The evils of the orb are sevenfold: Uncertainty (<a href="#pp_66">v. 66</a>), Insatiability (<a href="#pp_67">67</a>), Waste of bodies (<a href="#pp_68">68</a>), Continuous Conception (<a href="#pp_68">68</a>), Continual Change between high and low position (<a href="#pp_69">69 ff.</a>), Want of a companion (<a href="#pp_75">75</a>), and the six states of birth (<a href="#pp_77">77 ff.</a>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_66"><font color="GREEN">66</font></a>. Since there is a (constant) change between (the conditions of) father and son, mother and wife, friend and foe, (it is clear that) within the orb there is no certainty whatever.</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_68"><font color="GREEN">68</font></a>. The heap of any one's bones (from his successive births) exceeds in quantity mount Meru; and if a man were to count his (successive) mothers by grains (of soil) not larger than juniper-berries, the earth would not suffice (to form them).</p>

Even he who has been honoured in the world of Indra falls, through the force of his works (<i>karma</i>), again to the earth; even after having risen to world-sovereignty (<i>cakravartitvam</i>), he, in the course of transmigration, will become a slave.</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_70"><font color="GREEN">70</font></a>. After having enjoyed for a long time the happiness of touching the breasts and waists of the heaven-maids (<i>i.e.</i>, Apsaras, cf. <i>svargastrî</i>), one must endure in hell the intolerable pains of grinding, cutting, and lacerating.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The pain of grinding is to be endured in the hell <i>Sa.mghâta</i>, cutting in <i>Kâlasûtra</i>, and lacerating in <i>Tâpana</i> and <i>Pratâpana</i>. (S. <a href="#pp_77">v. 77, 78</a>.)</p>

After having dwelt for a long time on the summit of Meru, enjoying the pleasure of a ground that sinks and rises to the touch of the foot (<i>i.e.</i>, is elastic), afterwards the intolerable pain of walking on (in) hot ashes and mud is entailed on you.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. "A long time," thousand years of the gods. The "hot ashes" reach to the knees, and when you set down your foot skin, flesh, and blood are destroyed, and, on raising it, grow again. The "mud" is a morass of excrements, where beasts called: "Worm with the pointed bill" live, whose body is all white, the head black. These (beasts) pierce the skin of those animate beings (who are driven there by their fortune).</p>

 heaven-maids, in a pleasant and delightful grove, again you must undergo, in a wood where the leaves are like swords, the cutting of feet, hands, ears, and nose. (Cf. Manu, xii. 75.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_73"><font color="GREEN">73</font></a>. After having entered (<i>i.e.</i>, bathed in) <i>Mandâkinî</i> (<i>hdal-gyis hbab-pa</i>, "softly flowing," s. Amarakoça, Tib. transl.) which is gay with beautiful Apsarasas and (round which grow) golden lotuses you must again enter the intolerably salt water of the hell-river <i>Vaitara.ni</i> (<i>rab-med</i>, "fordless," Amarak.).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_74"><font color="GREEN">74</font></a>. After having obtained the very great happiness of desire (<i>i.e.</i>, of the senses) in the world of gods (viz., the <i>Kâmâvacara's</i>), and the unsensuous happiness of Brahmahood, you must, becoming fuel in the fire of (the hell) Avîci, suffer uninterrupted pains.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_75"><font color="GREEN">75</font></a>. After having become like sun and moon, and having illuminated with the light of your body the ends of the world, again you will come into the utter darkness, where you will not even see your arm, if you stretch it out.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The "utter darkness" is in the intermediate space of the worlds (<i>Lokântarika</i>). (Cf. the Comm. on <a href="#pp_50">v. 50</a> about <i>Îçvara</i>.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_76"><font color="GREEN">76</font></a>. Since then you must die in this manner (in uncertainty as to your fate), take the lamp of the three merits to give you light, for alone you must enter this endless darkness, which is untouched by sun and moon.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The three kinds of merits (meritorious actions) are: those of body, speech, and thought (<a href="#pp_5">v. 5</a>), or else: those arising from liberality, morality, and meditation (<i>i.e.</i>, the three <i>Çikshâ's</i>, <a href="#pp_53">v. 53</a>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_77"><font color="GREEN">77</font></a>. Those living beings that have committed sinful actions, will have to endure continuous pain in the hells <i>Sa.mjîva</i>, <i>Kâlasûtra</i>, <i>Mahâtâpana</i>, <i>Sa.mghâta Raurava</i>, <i>Avîci</i>, and so forth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. By "and so forth," he understands the remaining (of the eight hot hells), the cold hells, and the <i>Ñi-tse</i> (s. Jäschke, who has <i>ñi-thse</i>). . . . In (the hell) <i>Sa.mjîva</i> the living beings, being seized by different cutting instruments that have sprung from their (evil) works, all their principal

 and minor (<i>pratya"nga</i>) members are cut off, and, becoming insensible, they roll on the ground. Then there issues a voice from the sky: Become ye sound again (<i>khyed-rnams ya"n sos-par gyur-cig</i>), therefore this hell is called <i>Ya"n-sos</i>. In <i>Kâlasûtra</i> the living beings are put, by the tormentors (<i>skyes-bu gnod-pa bye-pad</i>), that are there, between mountains of different form, and, a black string (<i>thig-nag</i>) having been drawn, they are cut and split like wood, therefore this hell is called <i>Thig-nag</i>. In Sa.mghâta the l.b.,<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> having been assembled (<i>bsdus</i>) together, are pushed by the tormentors that are there, between mountains of different shape, and when these mountains are pressed together then the blood of those pressed flows like a river. Likewise they are put in a large iron press (<i>btsir-spyad</i>), where from above a large stone descends, pressing the iron ground (<i>sa-gzhi</i>), tormenting, oppressing, destroying (<i>hjolns-par byed</i>), everywhere, therefore this hell is called <i>Bsdus-hjoms</i> (or º <i>gzhom</i>). In <i>Raurava</i>, the l.b., seeking a dwelling (<i>i.e.</i>, some kind of refuge), are put into an iron house. From those that have entered there a fire springs up, and, becoming one (immense) flame, burns them (so vehemently) that they cry (<i>hbod</i>) in roaring lamentation; therefore this hell is called <i>"Nu-hbod</i> ("Wailing Cry"). In <i>Mahâurava</i>, which surpasses the last in cruelty, the l.b., seeking for a dwelling, are put into a house (not larger than a) box (and treated as before); therefore this hell is called <i>"Nu-hbod chen-po</i> ("The Great Wailing Cry"). In <i>Tâpana</i>, the l.b. are put--into (iron) pans, heated to a high degree, and roasted. Pierced by the fire as by spears, they give forth ashes, and from all their pores and apertures fire issues. Again they are laid down on the heated ground, and struck with very hot iron hammers. Therefore this hell is called "<i>Thsa-va</i>" ("The hot one"). In <i>Pratâpana</i> there is this difference, that they are stung by those (flames like) spear-points, of which two make ashes come forth from the back and front, one from the head. Also their bodies are bound with red-hot iron</p>

 bands. Again they are thrown, head foremost, into boiling salt-water contained in heated iron cauldrons, and wherever they go (<i>i.e.</i>, swim), their skin, flesh, and blood are destroyed, and nothing is left but a bony skeleton. When they emerge, their skin, flesh, and blood grow again. Therefore this hell is called <i>Rab-tu-thsa-va</i> ("The very hot one"). In <i>Avîci</i>, the fire burns from the four sides, from above and below, and meeting (in the middle) attacks skin, flesh, fibres, and the inmost marrow of the bones of the l.b., and dwells there, as if the essence (<i>sâra</i>) of fire had become attached to the body. Only by the doleful wailing cries you can tell which is the living being, which the fire, for (altogether) it looks like one mass of fire. And because there is for the l.b. no interval (<i>bar-mthsams</i>; to <i>vîci</i> also is given the meaning of <i>avakâça</i>, thus Childers: leisure) of fire and pain, therefore this hell is called <i>Mthsams-med</i> ("Continuous"); the same explanation in Chinese v. Eitel.--The usual Tibetan translation of <i>Avîci</i>; as also in our verse, is <i>Mnar-med</i> ("Painless"), and this would seem to be an euphemism opposed to the explanation found in Maheçvara's comm. on Amarak. (<i>na vidyate vîcih sukha.m yatra</i>). (Cf. Dharm. 121.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_78"><font color="GREEN">78</font></a>. Some are pressed like sesamum (seeds), others are ground to dust (so minute) like fine flour, some are split by saws, and others are cut by ugly knives with sharp edges.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. In <i>Sa.mghâta</i> they are pressed in the hot iron press (s. above), and also pounded, by the keepers of this hell, in iron sieves as mortars, with their sharp bills (snouts) as pestles. In <i>Kâlasûtra</i> they are split by the Lords of the Dead (<i>Yama's</i>), who, unconcerned about any man, <i>i.e.</i>, his woes, briskly begin their work (<i>mi-ci-la ma rag-par chas-pa brod-brod-ltar hdug-pa</i>), as wet wood is split by carpenters, with heated strong-toothed saws, and axes heated in the fire.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_79"><font color="GREEN">79</font></a>. In like manner others are made to drink the hot fluid of melted bronze, and some are fixed on iron stakes, red-hot and pointed.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. On the bank of the river Vaitara.nî (s.v. <a href="#pp_73">73</a>) they

 <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a>
 
 
 
 have opened their mouth with hot pincers, and made to drink metal that, by a violent fire, has lost its consistency, and may be drawn out (<i>sra-va-las thal-te nal-nal-po ñid-du gyur-pa</i>). The stakes are to be found in <i>Tâpana</i>.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_80"><font color="GREEN">80</font></a>. Some, lacerated by furious dogs with iron fangs, raise their hands to the sky (wailing, Comm.); others are seized by hawks with sharp iron bills, and ugly claws.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The dogs are in the wood with sword-leaves (<a href="#pp_72">v. 72</a>), the hawks in the <i>Çalmali</i>-wood (cf. Pet. Wört. s.v.).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_81"><font color="GREEN">81</font></a>. Some bitten by different kinds of worms and beetles, and ten thousand flesh-flies and blackflies, whose touch produces great ugly wounds, roll (unconscious on the ground), and utter loud lamentation.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. The "worms" grow out of the body, the "beetles" come from without; they are difIerent in colour and form; by the "black flies" is meant the black fly-abscess (? <i>sbra"n-ma lhi"n-nag</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_82"><font color="GREEN">82</font></a>. Some are burned without interruption in heaps of glowing embers, and even their mouths are filled (therewith); some are cooked in great cauldrons made of (!) iron, like the gourd (? <i>cu"n-pe"n</i>) of the fruit <i>Spiu-thsugs</i> (?).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. says that the former takes place in <i>Tâpana</i>, the latter in <i>Mahâtâpana</i>. (Cf. Manu, xii. 76.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_83"><font color="GREEN">83</font></a>. The sinner who, hearing of the endless pain of hell that is not interrupted for so long as one can retain his breath, becomes not afraid (and repents, Comm.), he has the character of a diamond (<i>i.e.</i>, is truly impassible, since the pains of hell will begin immediately after his death, Comm.).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_84"><font color="GREEN">84</font></a>. But those who, seeing a picture of hell, hearing (of hell), remembering (it), reading (about it), or making images (of it), generate fear (of it), they certainly will experience immense rewards (<i>vipâka</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <small>(S. Divyâv, p. 300 ff. on a picture of the hells (and the rest of the world) and its purpose. Such a picture is to be found, for instance, in Georgi, Alphab. Tibet.)</small></p>

 </p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_85"><font color="GREEN">85</font></a>. As among all blisses the bliss of the cessation of desire (<i>i.e.</i>, complete liberation, Comm.) is the highest, thus among all pains the pain of the hell Avîci is the most unsupportable.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_86"><font color="GREEN">86</font></a>. The pain of him who, in this (world), is, during an (entire) day vehemently stung with three hundred spears, cannot be compared even to the smallest pain of hell.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_87"><font color="GREEN">87</font></a>. This intolerable pain of hell does not end, even if you have endured it for a hundred <i>ko.ti's</i> of years; as long as the (fruits of) your sins are not exhausted, so long you will not get rid of your life (in hell).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_88"><font color="GREEN">88</font></a>. Therefore exert yourself with energy that there may not by any means be as much as an atom of the seed of this sin-fruit, (produced) by evil action, speech, or thought.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_89"><font color="GREEN">89</font></a>. Also in the condition of <i>brute</i> (you will suffer) killing, binding, striking, and various other pains; and (the brutes), having abandoned pacifying virtue (?), will eat up one another without pity.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. explains <i>zhi</i>(<i>-var</i>) <i>hgyur</i>(<i>-va</i>), what I translate "pacifying," by: <i>"nes-par hbyed-pai cha-da"n mthun-pa</i>, the same words that explain "contemplation" <a href="#pp_52">v. 52</a>, and "highest wisdom" <a href="#pp_53">v. 53</a> (one of the three Çikshâs), and says that <i>Nirvâ.na</i> is attained thereby, and that by want of this virtue the brutes are so stupid (as to devour each other).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_90"><font color="GREEN">90</font></a>. Some (brutes) are killed on account of (their) pearls, wool, bones, blood, flesh or hide; others forced into the service (of man) by kicks or blows of hand, whip or iron hook.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. For his "bones" (tusks) the elephant, for instance, is killed; for it's "flesh," game, etc.; for its hide, the leopard, etc. With "kicks" the horse is driven; with the "hand" the buffalo; with a "whip" the ass; with an "iron hook," the elephant.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_91"><font color="GREEN">91</font></a>. Among the <i>Preta's</i> also you must endure the uninterrupted (because never quenched, Comm.) pain born from the stings of desire, and the quite intolerable (pain) arising from hunger and thirst, heat and frost, weariness and fear.</p>

 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. Their "weariness" comes from their continually running after food (and never reaching it); "fear," from seeing the beings (tormenters armed) with swords, pestles, and leashes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_92"><font color="GREEN">92</font></a>. Some, having a mouth small as the eye of a needle, and a belly large as a mountain, are tortured by hunger, as they are not able to eat however little of the nasty excrements put before them. (Cf. Pañcagati, transl. Feer, Mus. Guim, v. 521.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_98"><font color="GREEN">98</font></a>. Some, having nothing left but skin and bones, are dried up like the naked top of a <i>Tâla</i>-tree; other, during the night, have a flaming mouth, and devour as food hot sand that falls into it.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. remarks that the "dry" Preta's are called <i>Asura's</i>. "Scorching sand" in Manu, xii. 76.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_94"><font color="GREEN">94</font></a>. But some common people, not finding matter (pus), excrements, blood, or other impurities strike each other in the face, when goitres will arise on their necks, on whose ripe matter they feed.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. "Common people" (Mob), because they have no merits (<i>i.e.</i>, even less than their companions).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_95"><font color="GREEN">95</font></a>. For the Preta's, in summer the moon herself is hot, in winter the sun himself is cold; the trees (in their region) are fruitless, and the rivers dry up, as soon as they look upon them.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. By their want of merit the boughs of the trees are burned as by fire, and lose fruits and leaves. The pleasant and cool rivers dry up (as if) burned by the poison of their eyes (<i>mig gdug-pai dug-gis bsregs-pa</i>). Some of them are filled (instead of food) with fire and live coal, some are thrust into rivers of matter, filled with different kinds of worms; some are filled with excrements and urine. (Cf. Feer, "Études Bouddhiques," 299.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_96"><font color="GREEN">96</font></a>. Without interruption this pain continues for those who have not abandoned sinful actions and have not reined in their body, some (of them) will not die (in this place of torment) in five thousand, some in ten thousand years.</p>

 torments as Pretas in one run (<i>i.e.</i>, without interruption), the Buddha has declared to be their avarice and mean niggardliness. (s. Feer, ll. p. 303 f.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_98"><font color="GREEN">98</font></a>. In <i>Heaven</i> also, though the pleasure to be enjoyed is great, the pain of dying is greater: thus thinking, noble (souls) do not wish for the perishable (joys of) heaven. (Cf. <a href="#pp_69">v. 69 ff.</a>)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_99"><font color="GREEN">99</font></a>. The colour of the body becoming ugly, want of pleasure in (their) couches, decaying of flower-wreaths, appearance of dirt on (their) cloths, dust, that had not been before, arising from (their) body,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_100"><font color="GREEN">100</font></a>. These are the five prognostics announcing death in heaven, that appear to the gods who dwell in the land of gods, similar to the signs that announce death to the men on earth. (Cf. Divyâv. ch. xiv. beg. Prof. Windisch points out to me the similar passage in Ittivuttakam, Sutt. 83.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_101"><font color="GREEN">101</font></a>. Those (now) who die off from the worlds of gods, if they have not any rest of (fruit of) virtue left, thence must irrevocably take their dwelling, according to their merit, among the Brutes, the Pretas, or in Hell.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <small>As god you cannot gain any merit (<a href="#pp_64">v. 64</a>). But the <i>Sarvâstivâdin's</i> taught the reverse, s. Rockhill, "Life of the Buddha," p. 191, better than Was. 247; cf. Feer, ll. p. 276 ff.</small></p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_102"><font color="GREEN">102</font></a>. Among the <i>Asura's</i> also, who, from their (spiteful) nature, hate (envy?) the splendour of the gods, there is much mental pain; and, though they have an intellect, from the inherent darkness of their state (<i>gati</i>) they are not able to see the truth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. They have an intellect (sufficient) to know the difference between virtue and vice, but, unable to stick to virtue in this state, they fall back to vice. "Darkness:" because, in the state of Asura, you are obliged to think continuously on vice, but in the state as god, thoughts and (power of) execution incline to virtue, there is a great difference between the states of god and Asura or any other (lower).

 not enlarge here, because he alluded to this before in the words: O Noble one, etc. (<a href="#pp_65">v. 65</a>), and because this (state) has been, before this, blamed (<i>i.e.</i>, described as undesirable) by different men (<i>s"nar ya"n mi rnam-pa du-mas smad-pai phyir</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_103"><font color="GREEN">103</font></a>. Since the orb is thus (constituted), that the birth as god, man, infernal being, brute, or Preta is (likewise) bad, understand (then) than birth (itself) is a receptacle of much harm.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_104"><font color="GREEN">104</font></a>. If a fire were to seize your head or your dress, you would extinguish and subdue it (by all means), even thus endeavour to annihilate desire, for there is no other higher necessity (duty) than this.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_105"><font color="GREEN">105</font></a>. By morality, knowledge, and contemplation, attain the spotless dignity of the quieting and the subduing Nirvâ.na, not subject to age, death, or decay, devoid of earth, water, fire, wind, sun, and moon.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. <i>Nirvâ.na</i> is twofold: with, and without, a rest of the Skandha's; the first "quiets" all pain, the second "subdues" the senses. (Cf. Childers 267 b. Oldenberg, Buddha, p. 432 (transl. p. 427) ff.; the three Çikshâs, s.v. <a href="#pp_53">53</a>, also Udânav. vi. 11.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_106"><font color="GREEN">106</font></a>. Recollection, investigation, energy, joy, calm, contemplation, equanimity, these seven members of knowledge are the rallying-points of the virtues whereby one reaches Nirvâ.na. (The seven <i>bodhya"nga's</i> v. Dharm. 49; cf. Dhammasa"nga.ni 1355.)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_107"><font color="GREEN">107</font></a>. Where there is no wisdom (<i>prajñâ</i>), there is also no contemplation (<i>dhyâna</i>); where there is no contemplation, there is also no wisdom; but know that for him who possesses these two, the sea of existence is like a grove (? <i>gnag-rjes</i>, perhaps <i>nags</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. Remarks on <i>gnag-rjes</i>: "because it (the sea of ex.) is easily traversed by him," so we might correct, perhaps, <i>gnag-rdsis</i>, and translate: "the sea of ex. is for him as for a <i>lord of cattle</i> (shepherd; who has the means to ride)," sc. is a meadow. (Cf. Udânav. xxxii. 28.)</p>

 Friend of the sun has explained, you must not (even) think, for by this (<i>i.e.</i>, in so doing) you cannot keep your mind quiet.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. Enumerates the fourteen <i>Avyâk.rtavastûni</i> (in the text was <i>loka</i>, s. Dharm. 137), and continues: These categories (<i>vastu</i>) are called undeclared, because they must not be declared, if anybody asks; they are questions to be put aside (<i>sthâpanîya</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_109"><font color="GREEN">109</font></a>. The Muni has declared that from Ignorance always springs the Conformations (in the text: <i>las</i>, "work"), thence Consciousness, thence Name and Form, thence the Six Organs of sense, thence Contact,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_110"><font color="GREEN">110</font></a>. From Contact springs Sensation, from the ground of Sensation Thirst will arise, from Thirst the Clinging (to existence) will be born, thence Being, and from Being comes Birth,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_111"><font color="GREEN">111</font></a>. And if Birth is (put) there arise Misery, Illness, Age, the pangs of desire, Death, Fear, and many other evils; but if Birth is stopped, all these are stopped (at the same time).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. First gives the list of the <i>Nidâna's</i>, as it is to be found in Dharm. 42, and also in Pâli s. Dhammasa"nga.ni 1336 (including the appendix <i>çoka<sup><small>0</small></sup></i>). Then follows a lengthy exposition of the single items, and the series as a whole (two leaves), wherefrom only the most important part is given here. "Ignorance" is the not-knowing the truth, and not acknowledging the highest aim (<i>paramârtha</i>). In an ignorant fool arise, in consequence of (his) not knowing virtue, vice; and in consequence of his not knowing the constant (<i>ânejja</i>, <i>âneñja</i> s. Childers), the <i>Conformations</i>. These are divided into (conform.) of body, speech, mind; here (in our verse) they are meant by Action (<i>las</i> = <i>karman</i>), because this also is divided in the same three parts (cf. Child. 454 b. Oldenberg 247 (transl. 241) ff.). By forming (lit. conforming) thoughts on the roots of these actions, <i>Consciousness</i> arises. This is sixfold (<i>i.e.</i>, the conception of the six senses, <a href="#pp_24">v. 24</a>; s. Was. p. 237 N). . . . <i>Name and Form</i> is the condition of the (embryo)

 conceived in the womb as <i>Kalalam</i>, etc. (s. Was. p. 236), which not yet has any sensation, etc., and (on the other side) the (child) come out, that has assumed a body (<i>rgyur byas-pa</i>). The embryo in its four states is "Name," because it leads to existence (<i>bhava</i>), and falls into the senses (? <i>yul-la hgro-va</i>): the emerged and embodied (human being) is "Form," because the (feeling) produced by cold, etc., arises (in it; ? <i>gra"n-va la sogs-pa hgyur-va bskyed-pai phyir</i>). (Cf. Child. 258 a; Oldenberg, p. 232 (transl. 227) ff.). . . . "Thirst" is the wish not to lose agreeable sensations, to get rid of unagreeable ones, and not to keep nor to lose those which are neither agreeable nor disagreeable (s. Dharm. 27); again it ("thirst") is, in the Sûtra, declared to be three-fold, according to its direction to the reign of pleasure, of form, or of the formless (s. Child. s.v. <i>ta.nhâ</i>). The "Clinging" is the violent desire (<i>hdun-pai hdod-chags</i>) of lust (<i>kâma</i>), etc. (s. Child. s.v. <i>upâdâna.m</i> and cf. <a href="#pp_51">v. 51</a>; Oldenberg, p. 239 N. 1). . . . When the seed of Conformations is well watered with (the water of) Thirst and Clinging, the fruit of Being is produced (cf. <a href="#pp_50">v. 50</a>). It is threefold like Thirst: (the Being) of pleasure, etc. (s. Child. s.v. <i>bhava</i>). But here chiefly the past existence is understood. When any one is born at the end of (this) existence, he is subject, one after the other, to (the states) "Name and Form" to "Sensation." . . . The whole series is divided into three parts: "Ignorance" and "Conformations" are (<i>i.e.</i>, refer to) the past birth; "Consciousness" to "Being," the present; "Birth" and "Age and Death," the future (one). . . .</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_112"><font color="GREEN">112</font></a>. This concatenation of causes is made clear (to us) by the Jina's word, and deep (in meaning); who perfectly understands this, he perfectly understands the teaching of the Buddha.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_113"><font color="GREEN">113</font></a>. Right views, living, energy, recollection, meditation, speech, action, thoughts these eight parts of the way practise in order to reach quiet. (S. Dharmas. 50. Dhammasa"nga.ni 297 ff. and 89 ff.).</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_114"><font color="GREEN">114</font></a>. Birth is Suffering, Thirst is the great cause from which all this springs, the prevention of this (thirst) is liberation, the path to attain this is that (above described) Noble eightfold path. (S. Dharm. 21).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_115"><font color="GREEN">115</font></a>. Therefore always exert yourself in order to understand the four truths, for even laymen (<i>g.rhastha</i>) who live in kingly estate will, by understanding (these truths), ford over the sea of sin (<i>kleça</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_116"><font color="GREEN">116</font></a>. Those that fulfil the law do not drop from the sky, nor do they rise, like a ripe crop, from the bosom of the earth, but, when you have abandoned (the state of) layman, dependent on former sin,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_117"><font color="GREEN">117</font></a>. Then it is not necessary to tell you in many (words) that you need not fear, as there is a useful counsel of this meaning: Subdue your mind, for Bhagavat has declared that the mind is the root of (all our) conditions (<i>dharma</i>).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <i>Comm</i>. says the meaning is that, if your mind is all pure, you will be quite happy, but if troubled, quite unhappy (Cf. Dhampd. 1; Udânav; xxxi.23 f.--M.M.'s translation is, as appears, justified by our comm.).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_118"><font color="GREEN">118</font></a>. To satisfy all these counsels (I have) given to thee in these words (<i>i.e.</i>, in this letter) would be difficult even for a Bhikshu (who has given up domestic life; how much more for a layman, <i>g.rhastha</i>, Comm.); therefore keep to the virtue thou art able to fulfil, and make (the best) use of your lifetime.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_119"><font color="GREEN">119</font></a>. When, always rejoicing at every virtue of every one, thou performest thyself the three kinds of good actions (<i>viz</i>., in thought, word, deed), then perfectly consecrated to attain Buddhaship, thou wilt, through this accumulation of merit,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_120"><font color="GREEN">120</font></a>. Having become, during innumerable births, <i>Yog</i>a-lord of all the worlds of gods and men, (as) the noble <i>Avalokiteçvara</i>, taking care of miserable mankind,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_121"><font color="GREEN">121</font></a>. Freeing (them) after (their) birth, from illness, age, lust, and envy, become, in the Buddha-field, like the Bhagavat <i>Amitâbha</i>, lord of the world, with immeasurable lifetime.</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_122"><font color="GREEN">122</font></a>. Having spread in the land of gods, in the sky (<i>Antariksha</i>, Comm.), and on earth the great spotless fame arising from Wisdom, Morality, and Liberality, and having perfectly quieted, (as) man on earth, and (as) God in heaven, the pleasure in the enjoyment of beautiful maidens,</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   <a name="pp_123"><font color="GREEN">123</font></a>. And having obtained the power of a <i>Jina</i>, that quiets fear, birth and death of all the living beings afflicted with pain, thou wilt obtain the dignity (of <i>Nirvâ.na</i> without a rest, Comm.), that surpasses the world, blotting out even the name (thereof), without fear and hunger, and not subject to death.</p>
