 <h2 align="center">THE EARLY VAISHNAVA POETS OF BENGAL.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="center">I. BIDYÂPATI.</h3>
 
 <p align="center">BY JOHN BEAMES, B.C.S., M.R.A.S., &amp;C.</p>
 
 <p>   HAVING, in the introductory essay, given a general view of the subject of Vaish.nava literature in its philosophical and general aspect, I propose now, in this and succeeding papers, to analyze more in detail the writings of some of the principal early masters, with special reference to their language. The Vaish.navas are the earliest writers in Bengali, and in them we trace the origin of that form of speech. In Bidyâpati indeed the language is hardly yet definitely Bengali: it is rather an extremely eastern member of the wide-spread group of dialects which we call, somewhat loosely, Hindi--a group whose peculiarities are, in the western portion of its area, allied to Panjâbi and Sindhi, while in the east they have developed characteristics which find their extreme, and almost exaggerated, expansion in modern Bengali.</p>
 
 <p>   Very little is known about Bidyâpati. Native tradition represents him as the son of one Bhabânanda Rai, a Brâhman of Barnator in Jessore. His real name was Basanta Rai, and he is mentioned by this name in one of the poems of the <i>Pada-kalpataru</i> (no. 1317). The date of his birth is said to be A.D. 1433, and of his death 1481. These dates are probably correct, as his language exhibits a stage of development corresponding to the beginning and middle of the fifteenth century. He mentions as his patrons Rai Sib Singh, Rûpnarâyana, and Lachhimâ Debi, wife of Sib Singh; and in one passage he prays for the "five lords of Gau.r" (chiranjîva rahu pa"ncha Gau.rešwara kabi Bidyâpati bha.ne). From these indications I should place the poet at Nadîya (Nabadwîpa), afterwards the birth-place of Chaitanya, Rai Sib Singh and the other "lords of Gau.r" being wealthy landowners of that district, and we may accept his language as a type of the vernacular of Upper Bengal (Gau.r) at that period.</p>
 
 <p>   A considerable number of this master's songs, under his <i>nom de plume</i> of Bidyâpati (lord of learning), are contained in the <i>Pada-kalpataru</i>; and his popularity is probably due to his being only just dead and still in great repute when Chaitanya was born. The reformer is said to have been fond of reciting his poems, as well as those of the Birbhûm poets, Jayadeva and Cha.n.dî Dâs, the former of whom wrote in Sanskrit and the latter in Bengali. The printed edition of the <i>Pada-kalpataru</i> is unfortunately very uncritically edited; and the compiler, Vaish.naba Dâs (or, as modern Bengalis would pronounce his name, Boishtob Das), is a man of very modern date, so that there is reason to suspect that a general modernization of the text has taken place, individual instances of which will be pointed out hereafter. Bengali scholars themselves admit this, and do not deny that the process has been ignorantly conducted, many a good racy word of <i>gâ</i>n<i>wârî</i>, or village Bindi, having been mangled to make it bear some resemblance to the modern Bengali, with which alone the editor was acquainted. A reconstruction of the text is not possible until the subject has been more thoroughly handled. Working alone in this virgin field, I am especially anxious to avoid all hasty and unsupported conjectures, and shall therefore treat the existing text as tenderly as possible, only suggesting such amended readings as are obviously demanded by the context, and bearing in mind that the great divergence of modern Bengali pronunciation from the ancient standard may have had some influence on the

 <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a>
 
 spelling, inasmuch as the poems were handed down orally for a long time before they were reduced to writing.</p>
 
 <p>   In making selections from this master, we are to a great extent confined to the amatory portions of the collection. The contemporaries of Chaitanya were the first to introduce the chaster poems, which treat of K.rish.na's early life in Braj (gosh.tha) and Jasodâ's maternal cares (bâtsalya). The pre-Chaitanya writers seldom speak of any thing but love of the grossest and most sensual kind.</p>
 
 <p>   In transliterating there is much uncertainty and irregularity in respect of the short final <i>a</i> sound. Strictly speaking, though omitted in prose, it should always be pronounced in verse; but if this rule were observed in these poems, the metre would be destroyed. As a general rule, Hindi words end with the consonant, and words still in their old Sanskrit form sound the vowel; thus we should read <i>jab</i>, <i>hâm</i>, but <i>bachana</i>, not <i>bachan</i>. This rule again, however, is constantly neglected; and I have therefore been guided by the practice of the Kirtanias, or professional singers, whose method of pronunciation depends upon the tune, and has been handed down by immemorial tradition. The Sanskrit <i>v</i> and <i>b</i> are both pronounced <i>b</i> in Bengali, and I have so written them throughout. The text and translation will be accompanied by a few notes explaining the difficult words or constructions; and I shall conclude with an attempt at sketching an outline of the grammar used in the poems.</p>

 <p>   The next example is historically interesting as containing the names of the master's patrons. Legend says that Lachhimâ Debi was to Bidyâpati what Beatrice was to Dante, and Laura to Petrarch; and it is hinted that she was something more; but this latter insinuation seems to be contradicted by his attachment to the husband, Sib Singh, so I prefer not to believe it.</p>

Jasmine and <i>bel</i> have planted their standard, with <i>pâtala</i>, <i>tula</i>, apd <i>ašoka</i> as generals, <i>kinšuka</i> and clove-vine tendrils along with them: seeing (them) the winter-season flies from before (them). The tribe of honey-bees have arrayed their ranks, they have routed entirely the whole of the winter; the water-lily has raised itself up and found life, with its own new leaves it makes itself a seat. A fresh spring shines in B.rindâban; Bidyâpati describes the essence of seasons.--III. xxvi. 7. (1450.)</p>

In breaking, it breaks not (this) wonderful love: it increases like the fibres of the lotus-stalk. All elephants are not of equal breed: not in every throat is the koïl's voice: not at all times is the spring season: not all men and women are excellent: quoth Bidyâpati--Listen, good lady, now having pondered, understand the ways of love.--I. v. 8.
