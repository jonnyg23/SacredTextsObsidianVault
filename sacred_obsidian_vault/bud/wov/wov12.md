 <p>100. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Better</span> than a thousand empty words is one pregnant word, which brings the hearer peace.</p>  
 <p>101. Better than a thousand idle songs is a single song, which brings the hearer peace.</p>  
 <p>102. Better it is to chant one verse of the law, that brings the hearer peace, than to chant a hundred empty songs.</p>  
 <p>103. If one were to conquer a thousand thousand in the battle—he who conquers self is the greatest warrior.</p>  
 <p>104, 105. Self-conquest is better than other victories: neither god nor demi-god, neither Mara nor Brahma, can undo the victory of such a one, who is self-controlled and always calm.</p>  
 <p>106. If month by month throughout a hundred years one were to offer sacrifices costing thousands, and if for a moment another were to reverence the self-controlled—this is the better worship.</p>  
 <p>107. If one for a hundred years tended the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacred fire in the glade, and another for a moment reverenced the self-controlled, this is the better worship.</p>  
 <p>108. Whatsoever sacrifice or offering a man makes for a full year in hope of benefits, all is not worth a quarter of that better offering—reverence to the upright.</p>  
 <p>109. In him who is trained in constant courtesy and reverence to the old, four qualities increase: length of days, beauty, gladness, and strength.</p>  
 <p>110. Better than a hundred years of impure and intemperate existence is a single day of moral, contemplative life.</p>  
 <p>111. Better is one day of wise and contemplative life than a thousand years of folly and intemperance.</p>  
 <p>112. Better one day of earnest energy than a hundred years of sloth and lassitude.</p>  
 <p>113. Better one day of insight into the fleeting nature of the things of sense, than a hundred years of blindness to this transiency.</p>  
 <p>114. Better one day of insight into the deathless state (Nirvāna), than a hundred years of blindness to this immortality.</p>  
 <p>115. Better one day of insight into the Supreme Law, than a hundred years of blindness to that Law.</p>
