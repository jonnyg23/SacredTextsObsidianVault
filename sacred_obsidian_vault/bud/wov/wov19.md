 <p>197. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">O Joy</span>! We live in bliss; amongst men of hate, hating none. Let us indeed dwell among them without hatred.</p>  
 <p>198. O Joy! In bliss we dwell; healthy amidst the ailing. Let us indeed dwell amongst them in perfect health.</p>  
 <p>199. Yea in very bliss we dwell: free from care amidst the careworn. Let us indeed dwell amongst them without care.</p>  
 <p>200. In bliss we dwell possessing nothing: let us dwell feeding upon joy like the shining ones in their splendour.</p>  
 <p>201. The victor breeds enmity; the conquered sleeps in sorrow. Regardless of either victory or defeat the calm man dwells in peace.</p>  
 <p>202. There is no fire like lust; no luck so bad as hate. There is no sorrow like existence: no bliss greater than Nirvāna (rest).</p>  
 <p>203. Hunger is the greatest ill: existence is the greatest sorrow. Sure knowledge of this is Nirvāna, highest bliss.</p>

 <p>204. Health is the greatest boon; content is the greatest wealth; a loyal friend is the truest kinsman; Nirvāna is the Supreme Bliss.</p>  
 <p>205. Having tasted the joy of solitude and of serenity, a man is freed from sorrow and from sin, and tastes the nectar of piety.</p>  
 <p>206. Good is the vision of the Noble; good is their company. He may be always happy who escapes the sight of fools.</p>  
 <p>207. He who consorts with fools knows lasting grief. Grievous is the company of fools, as that of enemies; glad is the company of the wise, as that of kinsfolk.</p>  
 <p>208. Therefore do thou consort with the wise, the sage, the learned, the noble ones who shun not the yoke of duty: follow in the wake of such a one, the wise and prudent, as the moon follows the path of the stars.</p>
