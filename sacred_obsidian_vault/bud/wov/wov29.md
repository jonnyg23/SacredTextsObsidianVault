 <p>360. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Good</span> is restraint of eye and ear: of smell and taste.</p>  
 <p>361. Good is restraint of action and of speech; restraint of mind and of every sense is good. The Bhikkhu restrained in all things casts aside every care.</p>  
 <p>362. Best amongst the temperate is he who is temperate in hand and foot and tongue: the man of inward joy and calm, him I call Bhikkhu.</p>  
 <p>363. The Bhikkhu who is temperate and moderate in speech, not puffed up, but a wise preacher and interpreter—sweet are his words!</p>  
 <p>364. He who abides in the law and takes his pleasure therein, revolving it in his mind and pondering it, he is a Bhikkhu who falls not away from the Law.</p>  
 <p>365. Let him neither make much of his own gain, nor envy that of others: the Bhikkhu who envies others attains not the true meditation.</p>  
 <p>366. Even the gods praise that Bhikkhu whose</p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p>own gain is slight, yet who covets not the gain of other men, but lives pure and strenuous.</p>  
 <p>367. He who clings not to self-hood and to existence, but mourns at the vanity of this fleeting world, he is called Bhikkhu.</p>  
 <p>368. The Bhikkhu who lives kindly and trusts in Buddha's Teaching he approaches Nirvāna, the calm and blissful end of rebirth.</p>  
 <p>369. Bale out the ship, O Bhikkhu, then will it go lightly; cut the thongs of lust and hate; so wilt thou come to Nirvāna.</p>  
 <p>370. Cut the five bonds, leave other five, and take in their place five more: he who has got beyond the five evil states is said to have crossed the flood.</p>  
 <p>371. Keep vigil, O Bhikkhu, be not slothful, let not your mind dally with delights: suffer not the pangs of hell, and wail not as the flames devour you, "O day of woe"!</p>  
 <p>372. There is no meditation apart from wisdom; there is no wisdom apart from meditation. Those in whom wisdom and meditation meet are not far from Nirvāna.</p>  
 <p>373. Divine pleasure is his who enters into solitude, the Bhikkhu who is calmed and sees the law with the seeing eye:</p>  
 <p>374. Whenever he ponders the beginning and the end of the elements of being, he finds joy and bliss; nectar it is to those who know.</p>  
 <p>375. This is the beginning in my teaching for</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>a wise Bhikkhu; self-mastery, contentment, and control by the precepts: to cultivate those who are noble, righteous, and zealous friends;</p>  
 <p>376. To be hospitable and courteous, this is to be glad and to make an end of sorrow.</p>  
 <p>377. As jasmine sheds its withered blossoms so, O Bhikkhus, do you put away lust and hatred.</p>  
 <p>378. He who is controlled in act, in speech, in thought, and altogether calmed, having purged away worldliness, that Bhikkhu is called calm.</p>  
 <p>379. Come, rouse thyself! Examine thine own heart. The Bhikkhu who is thus self-guarded and mindful will live in happiness.</p>  
 <p>380. Each man is his own helper, each his own host; therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a spirited horse.</p>  
 <p>381. The glad Bhikkhu who puts his trust in Buddha's Preaching goes to Nirvāna, calm and blissful end of rebirth.</p>  
 <p>382. Let the young Bhikkhu apply himself to Buddha's Preaching: so will he light up the world as the moon escaped from the clouds.</p>
