 <p><i>"Lo! countless trees," etc.</i>—This story the Master dwelling at Jetavana told concerning the Verañjā section <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">1</font></a>. When the Master after passing the rainy season at Verañjā in due course arrived at Sāvatthi, the Brethren in the Hall of Truth raised a discussion saying, "Sirs, a Tathāgata, a delicately nurtured kshatriya and Buddha, though possessed of supernatural powers, at the invitation of a brahmin of Verañjā stayed three ṃonths with him, and when owing to the temptation of Māra he failed to receive an alms at the hands of the brahmin, even for a single day, he gave up all covetous ways, and keeping in the same place for three months lived on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots. [4951 Oh the contented nature of Tathāgatas!" When the Master came and on inquiry learned the nature of their discussion he said, "It is no marvel, Brethren, that a Tathāgata now has lost all covetousness, seeing that formerly when born in an animal form he forsook covetousness." And hereupon he told a story of the past. The whole story is now to be related in detail in exactly the same way as in the preceding tale.</p>

 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Lo! countless trees are here, all green and fruitful see!<br> Why, parrot, dost thou cling to this poor withered tree?  
 <p>Long years we have enjoyed the luscious fruit it bare,<br> And tho’ it now has none, it still should claim our care.</p>  
 <p>Nor leaves nor fruit it yields, alas! the tree is dead:<br> Why blame thy fellow-birds, that they should all have fled?</p>  
 <p>They loved it for its fruit, and now that it has none,<br> Poor selfish fools! their love and gratitude is gone.</p>  
 <p>Thy gratitude I own, thy true and constant love,<br> Sure virtue such as this the wise will aye approve.</p>  
 <p>I offer thee, O bird, whate’er thou wilt for choice;<br> Tell me, I pray, what boon would most thy heart rejoice?</p>  
 <p>Would that this tree alight bear fresh leaves and fruit again;<br> I would be glad as they that treasure trove obtain.</p>  
 <p>Then was the tree by Sakka with ambrosia sprinkled o’er,<br> And boughs sprang up with cooling shade, as lovely as before.</p>  
 <p>May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blesséd be,<br> As I to-day am blest this joyous sight to see.</p>  
 <p>Thus was the tree made fruitful by the parrot's grateful choice,<br> And Sakka and his queen in groves of Nandana rejoice.</p></div></small></p>

 <p>[496] The Master, his lesson ended, identified the Birth: "In those days Sakka was Anuruddha, the parrot king was myself."</p>
