 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Mahâ-Nidâna-Sutta of the Dighâ-Nikâya (Grimblot's edition, p. 245<sup>1</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   Thus have I heard.</p>
 
 <p>   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus where was the Kuru-town named Kammâsadhamma.</p>

 <p>   Then drew near the venerable Ânanda to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "O wonderful is it, Reverend Sir! O marvellous is it, Reverend Sir! How profound, Reverend Sir, is Dependent Origination, and of how profound an appearance! To me, nevertheless, it is as clear as clear can be."</p>
 
 <p>   "O Ânanda, say not so! O Ânanda, say not so! Profound, Ânanda, is Dependent Origination, and profound of appearance. It is through not understanding this doctrine, Ânanda, through not penetrating it, that thus mankind is like to an entangled warp, or to an ensnarled web, or to muñja-grass and pabbaja-grass, and fails to extricate itself from punishment, suffering, perdition, rebirth.</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Do old age and death depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'They do.' And if it be asked, 'On what do old age and death depend?' the reply should be, 'Old age and death depend on birth.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does birth depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked, 'On what does birth depend?' the reply should be, 'Birth depends on existence.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does existence depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked, 'On what does existence depend?' the reply should be, 'Existence depends on attachment.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does attachment depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked, 'On what does attachment depend?' the reply should be, 'Attachment depends on desire.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does desire depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked, 'On what does desire depend?' the reply should be, 'Desire depends on sensation.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does sensation depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked,</p>

 <p>'On what does sensation depend?' the reply should be, 'Sensation depends on contact.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Ânanda, if it be asked, 'Does contact depend on anything?' the reply should be, 'It does.' And if it be asked, 'On what does contact depend?' the reply should be, 'Contact depends on name and form.'</p>

 <p>   "On birth depend old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair. Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise.</p>
 
 <p>   "I have said that on birth depend old age and death. This truth, Ânanda, that on birth depend old age and death, is to be understood in this way. Suppose, Ânanda, there were utterly and completely no birth at all for any one into any world, as, namely, for gods into the world of gods; for genii into the world of genii; for ogres into the world of ogres; for demons into the world of demons; for men into the world of men; for quadrupeds into the world of quadrupeds; for winged creatures into the world of winged creatures; for creeping things into the world of creeping things;--suppose, Ânanda, there were no birth for any of these beings into their several worlds: if there were nowhere any</p>
