 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Majjhima-Nikâya, and constituting Sutta 26.</small></p>
 
 <p>   Thus have I heard.</p>
 
 <p>   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park. Then The Blessed One, having put on his tunic in the morning, and taken his bowl and his robes, entered Sâvatthi for alms.</p>
 
 <p>   Then a great number of priests drew near to where the venerable Ânanda was; and having drawn near, they spoke to the venerable Ânanda as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "It is a long time, brother Ânanda, since we listened to a doctrinal discourse from the mouth of The Blessed One. Come, brother Ânanda, let us obtain an opportunity to listen to a doctrinal discourse from the mouth of The Blessed One."</p>
 
 <p>   "Well, then, venerable sirs, draw near to the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman. Perchance you may obtain an opportunity to listen to a doctrinal discourse from the mouth of The Blessed One."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, brother," said the priests to the venerable Ânanda in assent.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One, when he had gone the rounds for alms in Sâvatthi, returned from his begging, and after breakfast, addressed the venerable Ânanda:</p>
 
 <p>   "Let us go hence, Ânanda, and to Eastern Monastery, and to the storied mansion of Migâra's mother will we draw near for our noon-day rest."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One, in company with the venerable Ânanda, drew near to Eastern Monastery, and to the storied mansion of Migâra's mother, for his noon-day rest. Then The Blessed One, in the afternoon, rose from meditation, and addressed the venerable Ânanda:</p>

 <p>   "Let us go hence, Ânanda, and to Eastern Tank will we draw near to bathe our limbs."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One, in company with the venerable Ânanda, drew near to Eastern Tank to bathe his limbs; and having bathed his limbs in Eastern Tank and come up out of the water, he stood with but a single garment on, drying his limbs.</p>
 
 <p>   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Sir, here is the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, but a short way off. Delightful, Reverend Sir, is the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman; enchanting, Reverend Sir, is the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman. Reverend Sir, pray let The Blessed One be so kind as to draw near to where the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman is." And The Blessed One consented by his silence.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One drew near to where the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman was. Now at that time a great number of priests were seated in the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, engaged in doctrinal discourse. Then The Blessed One stood outside in the entrance porch, and awaited the end of the discourse. Then The Blessed One, when he perceived that the discourse had come to an end, coughed, and rattled the bolt of the door. And the priests opened the door for The Blessed One. Then The Blessed One entered the monastery of Rammaka the Brahman, and sat on the seat that was spread for him. And when The Blessed One had sat down, he addressed the priests:</p>
 
 <p>   "What, O priests, was the subject of the present meeting? and what the discourse you were holding?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Sir, our doctrinal discourse was concerning The Blessed One, and then The Blessed One arrived."</p>
 
 <p>   "Well said, O priests! This, O priests, is worthy of you as youths of good family, who have through faith retired from the household life to the houseless one, that ye sit together in doctrinal discourse. O priests, one of two things</p>

 <p>   "There are two cravings, O priests; the noble one, and the ignoble one. And what, O priests, is the ignoble craving?</p>
 
 <p>   "We may have, O priests, the case of one who, himself subject to birth, craves what is subject to birth; himself subject to old age, craves what is subject to old age; himself subject to disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, craves what is subject to corruption.</p>

 <p>   "Now I, O priests, before my Buddhaship, being not yet a Buddha, but a Future Buddha, myself subject to birth, craved what was subject to birth; myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, craved what was subject to corruption. And it occurred to me, O priests, as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "'Why, myself subject to birth, do I crave what is subject to birth? myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, do I crave what is subject to corruption? What if now, myself subject to birth, and perceiving the wretchedness of what is subject to birth, I were to crave the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from birth; myself subject to old age, . . . disease, . . . death, . . . sorrow, . . . corruption, I were to crave the incomparable security of a Nirvana free from corruption?'</p>
 
 <p>   "Subsequently, O priests, although of tender age, with the black hair of a lad, and in the hey-day of my youth, and just entering on my prime, and although my mother and my father were unwilling, and tears streamed from their eyes, I had my hair and my beard shaved off, and put on yellow garments, and retired from the household life to the houseless one. And having thus retired from the world, and craving the summum bonum, the incomparable peaceful state, I drew near to where Âlâra Kâlâma was; and having drawn near, I spoke to Âlâra Kâlâma as follows:</p>

 <p>   "'Where does the band of five priests dwell at present?'</p>
 
 <p>   "And I, O priests, with my divinely clear vision surpassing that of men, saw the band of five priests dwelling at Benares, in the deer-park Isipatana.</p>
 
 <p>   "Then, O priests, having dwelt at Uruvelâ as long as I wished, I proceeded on my wanderings in the direction of Benares. And Upaka, a naked ascetic, beheld me proceeding along the highway between the Bo-tree and Gayâ. And having seen me, he spoke to me as follows:</p>

 <p>   "'You may be right, brother,' replied Upaka, the naked ascetic; and shaking his head, he took another road and departed.</p>
 
 <p>   "Then, O priests, I proceeded on my wanderings from place to place, and drew near to Benares, to the deer-park Isipatana, and to where the band of five priests was. And, O priests, the band of five priests saw me approaching from afar, and, when they had seen me, they made an agreement among themselves, saying:</p>

But, O priests, they addressed me by my name, and by the title of 'Brother.' When, O priests, I noticed this, I spoke to the band of five priests as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "'O priests, address not The Tathâgata by his name, nor by the title of "Brother." A saint, O priests, is The Tathâgata, a Supreme Buddha. Give ear, O priests! The deathless has been gained, and I will instruct you, and teach you the Doctrine. If ye will do according to my instructions, in no long time, and in the present life, ye shall learn for yourselves, and shall realize and live in the possession of that highest good to which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good family so nobly retire from the household life to the houseless one.'</p>
 
 <p>   "When I had thus spoken, O priests, the band of five priests said to me as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "'Brother Gotama, those practices of yours, that method of procedure, those stern austerities did not enable you to transcend human limitations and attain to pre-eminence in full and sublime knowledge and insight. How, then, now that you are luxurious, and have given up the struggle and devoted yourself to a life of luxury, can you have transcended human limitations and attained to pre-eminence in full and sublime knowledge and insight?'</p>
