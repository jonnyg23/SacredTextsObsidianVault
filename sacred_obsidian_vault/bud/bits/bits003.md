 <p>   Now in accomplishing these Ten Perfections there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of almsgiving; as when he was born as the Brahman Akitti, the Brahman Samkha, king Dhanañjaya, Mahâ-Sudassana, Mahâ-Govinda, king Nimi, prince Canda, Visayha the treasurer, king Sivi, and king Vessantara. But the acme was reached when as the Wise Hare<a name="page_35_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_35_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> he said,--</p>

 <p>Thus, in this offering up of his own life, he acquired the perfection of almsgiving in its highest degree.</p>
 
 <p>   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the precepts; as when he was born as the elephant-king Sîlava, the snake-king Campeyya, the snake-king Bhûridatta, the elephant-king Chaddanta, and prince Alînasattu, son of king Jayaddisa. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Samkhapâla Birth-Story, he said,--</p>

 <p>Thus, free from attachment, he renounced a kingdom and retired from the world, and by so doing acquired the perfection of abnegation in its highest degree.</p>
 
 <p>   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of knowledge; as when he was born as the pandit Vidhûra, the pandit Mahâ-Govinda, the pandit Kuddâla, the pandit Araka, the wandering ascetic Bodhi, and the pandit Mahosadha. But the acme was reached when, as the pandit Senaka of the Sattubhatta Birth-Story, he said,--</p>

 <p>and displayed to all present the serpent which lay concealed in the bag, and in so doing acquired the perfection of wisdom in its highest degree.</p>
 
 <p>   Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of courage. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Greater Janaka Birth-Story, he said,--</p>

 <p>in resolving on a course of conduct that cost him his life, he acquired the perfection of resolution in its highest degree.</p>

 <tr valign="top"><td>267. </td><td>"No fear has any one of me,<br>

 </table>
 
 <p>in the exercise of feelings of good-will, and in taking no thought for his life, he acquired the perfection of good-will in its highest degree.</p>
 
 <p>   Likewise in the Lomahamsa Birth-Story, where he said,--</p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="5">
 
 <tr valign="top"><td>268. </td><td>"I laid me down among the dead,<br>
 A pillow of their bones I made;<br>

 <p>while village children flocked about him, and some spat and others showered fragrant garlands upon him, he was indifferent alike to pleasure and pain, and acquired the perfection of indifference in its highest degree.</p>
 
 <p>   The above is an abridgment, but the full account is given in the Cariyâ-Pitaka.</p>
 
 <p>   Having thus fulfilled all the perfections, he said, in his existence as Vessantara,--</p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="5">
 
 <tr valign="top"><td>269. </td><td>"This earth, unconscious though she be,<br>
 And ignorant of joy or grief,<br>
 E'en she then felt alms' mighty power,<br>
 And shook and quaked full seven times."<br></td></tr>
 
 </table>
 
 <p>And having thus caused the earth to quake by his mighty deeds of merit, at the end of that existence he died, and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.</p>
 
 <p>   Accordingly the period from the time when he fell at the feet of Dîpamkara to his birth in the city of the Tusita gods constitutes the Distant Epoch.</p>

The stanza quoted, however, is not taken from that account, but from another work called the Cariyâ-Pitaka, which is wholly in poetry. The Cariyâ-Pitaka consists of Birth-Stories, and besides the Wise Hare, gives several others of those here mentioned. Some are also briefly alluded to in the ninth chapter of the Visuddhi-Magga; but of course the great treasure-house for Birth-Stories is the Jâtaka itself.</p>
