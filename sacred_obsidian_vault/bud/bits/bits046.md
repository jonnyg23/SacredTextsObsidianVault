 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 46. IS THIS TO BE MY LAST EXISTENCE?</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Milindapañha (41<sup>11</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante Nâgasena," said the king, "does a man know when he is not to be born into another existence?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Assuredly, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, how does he know it?"</p>
 
 <p>   "He knows it from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</p>
 
 <p>   "Give an illustration."</p>
 
 <p>   "It is as if, your majesty, a house-holding farmer were to plow and sow and fill his granary; and then were neither to plow nor sow, and were to use the grain previously stored up, or give it away, or do with it however else might suit him: your majesty, would this house-holding farmer know that his granary would not become filled up again?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Assuredly, bhante, would he know it."</p>
 
 <p>   "How would he know it?"</p>
 
 <p>   "He would know it from the cessation of all cause or reason for the filling up of the granary."</p>
 
 <p>   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence, from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</p>
 
 <p>   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."</p>
