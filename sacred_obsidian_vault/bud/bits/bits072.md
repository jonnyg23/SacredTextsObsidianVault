 <p>   Now at that time The Blessed One enlightened, incited, quickened, and gladdened the priests by a sermon on Nirvana. And the priests, listening to the discourse with attentive ears, became convinced, stored it up in their thoughts, and seized upon it with their whole minds.</p>
 
 <p>   Then it occurred to Mâra, the Wicked One, as follows:</p>
