 <p>   As tradition relates, The Blessed One was teaching the Doctrine to the inhabitants of the town of Campâ, on the banks of Lake Gaggarâ; and a certain frog, at the sound of The Blessed One's voice, obtained the mental reflex. And a certain cowherd, as he stood leaning on his staff, pinned him down fast by the head.

 And while I listened to thy Law,<br>
 A cowherd crushed me, and I died."<br>

 <p>   Then The Blessed One taught him the Doctrine, and the conversion of eighty four thousand living beings took place. And the frog, who had become a god, became established in the fruit of conversion, and with a pleased smile on his face departed.</p>
