 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 12. THE DEATH OF THE BUDDHA.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Mahâ-Parinibbâna-Sutta (v. and vi.) of the Digha-Nikâya.</small></p>
 
 <p>   T<small>HEN</small> The Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda:--</p>
 
 <p>   "Let us go hence, Ânanda. To the further bank of the Hiraññavatî river, and to the city of Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the Mallas will we draw near."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One, accompanied by a large congregation of priests, drew near to the further bank of the Hiraññavatî river, and to the city of Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the Mallas; and having drawn near, he addressed the venerable Ânanda:--</p>
 
 <p>   "Be so good, Ânanda, as to spread me a couch with its head to the north between twin sal-trees. I am weary, Ânanda, and wish to lie down."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent, and spread the couch with its head to the north between twin sal-trees. Then The Blessed One lay down on his right side after the manner of a lion, and placing foot on foot, remained mindful and conscious.</p>
 
 <p>   Now at that time the twin sal-trees had completely burst forth into bloom, though it was not the flowering season;</p>

 <p>   "Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of me." Then it occurred to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "Here, this venerable Upavâna has for a long time been the body-servant of The Blessed One, and kept himself at his beck and call; yet, although his last moments are near, The Blessed One is harsh to the venerable Upavâna saying, 'Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of me.' What, pray, was the reason, and what was the cause, that The Blessed One was harsh to the venerable Upavâna saying, 'Step aside, O priest; stand not in front of me'?"</p>

 <p>   "Ânanda, almost all the deities throughout ten worlds have come together to behold The Tathâgata. For an extent, Ânanda, of twelve leagues about the city Kusinârâ and the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the Mallas, there is not a spot of ground large enough to stick the point of a hair into, that is not pervaded by powerful deities. And these deities, Ânanda, are angered, saying, 'From afar have we come to behold The Tathâgata, for but seldom, and on rare occasions, does a Tathâgata, a saint, and Supreme Buddha arise in the world; and now, to-night, in the last watch, will The Tathâgata pass into Nirvana; but this powerful priest stands in front of The Blessed One, concealing him, and we have no</p>

 <p>   "What are the deities doing, Reverend Sir, whom The Blessed One perceives?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Some of the deities, Ânanda, are in the air with their minds engrossed by earthly things, and they let fly their hair and cry aloud, and stretch out their arms and cry aloud, and fall headlong to the ground and roll to and fro, saying, 'All too soon will The Blessed One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Happy One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Light of the World vanish from sight!' Some of the deities, Ânanda, are on the earth with their minds engrossed by earthly things, and they let fly their hair and cry aloud, and stretch out their arms and cry aloud, and fall headlong on the ground and roll to and fro, saying, 'All too soon will The Blessed One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Happy One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Light of the World vanish from sight.' But those deities which are free from passion, mindful and conscious, bear it patiently, saying, 'Transitory are all things. How is it possible [that whatever has been born, has come into being, and is organized and perishable, should not perish? That condition is not possible.]'"</p>

 <p>   "Enough, Ânanda, do not grieve, nor weep. Have I not already told you, Ânanda, that it is in the very nature of all things near and dear unto us that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them?

In them are many wealthy men of the warrior caste, many wealthy men of the Brahman caste, and many wealthy householders who are firm believers in The Tathâgata, and they will perform the funeral rites for The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   "O Ânanda, say not so! O Ânanda, say not so, that this is a wattel-and-daub town, a town of the jungle, a branch village. There was once, Ânanda, a king called Sudassana the Great, who was a Universal Monarch, a virtuous king of justice, a victorious ruler of the four quarters of the earth, possessing a secure dominion over his territory and owning the seven precious gems.<a name="page_101_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_101_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> This city Kusinârâ, Ânanda, was the capital of king Sudassana the Great, and had then the name of Kusâvatî. From the east to the west it was twelve leagues in length, and from the north to the south it was seven leagues in breadth. Kusâvatî, the capital, Ânanda, was prosperous and flourishing, populous and thronging with people, and well provided with food. As Âlakamandâ, the capital of the gods, Ânanda, is prosperous and flourishing, populous and thronging with gods, and is well provided with food, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, Kusâvatî, the capital, was prosperous and flourishing, populous and thronging with people, and well provided with food. Kusâvatî, the capital, Ânanda, was neither by day nor night without the ten noises,--to wit, the noise of elephants, the noise of horses, the noise of chariots, the noise of drums, the noise of tabors, the noise of lutes, the noise of song, the noise of cymbals, the noise of gongs, and the tenth noise of people crying, 'Eat ye, and drink!'</p>

Be favorable, be favorable, O ye Vâsetthas, and suffer not that afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, "The Tathâgata passed into Nirvana while in our borders, but we did not avail ourselves of the opportunity of being present at the last moments of The Tathâgata."'"</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent; and putting on his tunic, and taking his bowl and his robes, he went to Kusinârâ with another member of the Order.</p>
 
 <p>   Now at that time, the Kusinârâ-Mallas were assembled together in the town-hall on some matter of business. And the venerable Ânanda drew near to the town-hall of the Kusinârâ-Mallas; and having drawn near, he made announcement to the Kusinârâ-Mallas, as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "To-night, O ye Vâsetthas, in the last watch, The Tathâgata will pass into Nirvana. Be favorable, be favorable, O ye Vâsetthas, and suffer not that afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, 'The Tathâgata passed into Nirvana while in our borders, but we did not avail ourselves of the opportunity of being present at the last moments of The Tathâgata.'"</p>
 
 <p>   The Mallas, on hearing this speech of the venerable Ânanda, and their children and their daughters-in-law and their wives were grieved and sorrowful and overwhelmed with anguish of mind, and some let fly their hair and cried aloud, and stretched out their arms and cried aloud, and fell headlong to the ground and rolled to and fro, saying, "All too soon will The Blessed One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Happy One pass into Nirvana; all too soon will The Light of the World vanish from sight." Then the Mallas and their children and their daughters-in-law and their wives, being grieved and sorrowful and overwhelmed with anguish of mind, drew near to the sal-tree grove Upavattana of the Mallas, and to where the venerable Ânanda was.</p>
 
 <p>   Then it occurred to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "If I shall cause the Kusinârâ-Mallas one by one to do reverence to The Blessed One, the day will dawn ere they have finished. What if now I marshal the Mallas by families,</p>

 <p>   And the venerable Ânanda marshalled the Mallas by families, and caused them by families to do reverence to The Blessed One, Baying, "Reverend Sir, a Malla named so-and-so, with his children, his wife, his following, and his friends, bows low in reverence at the feet of The Blessed One." And the venerable Ânanda by this device succeeded in causing all the Kusinari-Mallas to do reverence to The Blessed One before the end of the first watch of the night.</p>
 
 <p>   Now at that time Subhadda, a wandering ascetic, was dwelling at Kusinârâ. And Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, heard the report:--</p>
 
 <p>   "To-night, in the last watch, the monk Gotama will pass into Nirvana."</p>
 
 <p>   Then it occurred to Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, as follows:--</p>

 <p>   "Gotama, all those monks and Brahmans who possess a large following and crowds of hearers and disciples, and who are distinguished, renowned leaders of sects, and highly esteemed by the multitudes,--to wit, Pûrana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosâla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccâyana, Sañjaya Belatthiputta, Nigantha Nâthaputta,--have they all done as they maintain, discovered the truth, or have they not? or have some of them done so, and others not?"</p>

 <p>then am I ready to spend four years on probation, and after the lapse of four years, let strenuous-minded priests' receive me into the Order and confer on me the priestly ordination."</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda,</p>
 
 <p>   "Well, then, Ânanda, receive Subhadda into the Order."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir," said the venerable Ânanda to The Blessed One in assent.</p>
 
 <p>   Then Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, spoke to the venerable Ânanda as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "How fortunate you priests are, brother Ânanda! How supremely fortunate, brother Ânanda, that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of discipleship at the hands of The Teacher himself."</p>
 
 <p>   And Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, retired from the world under The Blessed One, and received ordination. And without delay, after he had received ordination, the venerable Subhadda began to live solitary and retired, vigilant, strenuous, and zealous; and in no long time, and while yet alive, he came to learn for himself, and to realize, and to live in the possession of that highest good to which the holy life conducts, and for the sake of which youths of good family so nobly retire from the household life to the houseless one. And he knew that for him rebirth was exhausted, that he had lived the holy life, that he had done what it behooved him to do, and that he was no more for this world. So the venerable Subhadda became of the number of the saints, and he was the last disciple made by The Blessed One himself.</p>

 <p>   Then The Blessed One addressed the venerable Ânanda:--</p>
 
 <p>   "It may be, Ânanda, that some of you will think, 'The word of The Teacher is a thing of the past; we have now no Teacher.' But that, Ânanda, is not the correct view. The Doctrine and Discipline, Ânanda, which I have taught and enjoined upon you is to be your teacher when I am gone. But whereas now, Ânanda, all the priests address each other with the title of 'brother,' not so must they address each other after I am gone. A senior priest, Ânanda, is to address</p>

 <p>a junior priest either by his given name, or by his family name, or by the title of 'brother;' a junior priest is to address a senior priest with the title 'reverend sir,' or 'venerable.' If the Order, Ânanda, wish to do so, after I am gone they may abrogate all the lesser and minor precepts.

 <p>   "Let Channa, Ânanda, say what he likes, he is not to be spoken to nor admonished nor instructed by the priests."</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--</p>
 
 <p>   "It may be, O priests, that some priest has a doubt or perplexity respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or the course of conduct. Ask any questions, O priests, and suffer not that afterwards ye feel remorse, saying, 'Our Teacher was present with us, but we failed to ask him all our questions.'"</p>
 
 <p>   When he had so spoken, the priests remained silent.</p>
 
 <p>   And a second time The Blessed One, and a third time The Blessed One addressed the priests:--</p>

 <p>   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--</p>
 
 <p>   "It may be, O priests, that it is out of respect to The Teacher that ye ask no questions. Then let each one speak to his friend."</p>
 
 <p>   And when he had thus spoken, the priests remained silent.</p>

 <p>Sir! Reverend Sir, I have faith to believe that in this congregation of priests not a single priest has a doubt or perplexity respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or the course of conduct."</p>
 
 <p>   "With you, Ânanda, it is a matter of faith, when you say that; but with The Tathâgata, Ânanda, it is a matter of knowledge that in this congregation of priests not a single priest has a doubt or perplexity respecting either The Buddha or the Doctrine or the Order or the Path or the course of conduct. For of all these five hundred priests, Ânanda, the most backward one has become converted, and is not liable to pass into a lower state of existence, but is destined necessarily to attain supreme wisdom."</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One addressed the priests:--</p>
 
 <p>   "And now, O priests, I take my leave of you; all the constituents of being are transitory; work out your salvation with diligence."</p>
 
 <p>   And this was the last word of The Tathâgata.</p>
 
 <p>   Thereupon The Blessed One entered the first trance; and rising from the first trance, he entered the second trance; and rising from the second trance, he entered the third trance; and rising from the third trance, he entered the fourth trance; and rising from the fourth trance, he entered the realm of the infinity of space; and rising from the realm of the infinity of space, he entered the realm of the infinity of consciousness; and rising from the realm of the infinity of consciousness, he entered the realm of nothingness; and rising from the realm of nothingness, he entered the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception; and rising from the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception, he arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation.</p>
 
 <p>   Thereupon the venerable Ânanda spoke to the venerable Anuruddha as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Anuruddha, The Blessed One has passed into Nirvana."</p>
 
 <p>   "Nay, brother Ânanda, The Blessed One has not passed into Nirvana; he has arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation."</p>
