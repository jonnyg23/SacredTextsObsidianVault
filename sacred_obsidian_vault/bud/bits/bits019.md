 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 19. WHAT IS UNITY OR ONE?</p>
 
 <p align="center">{The Wish-free Birth-Story.}</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Jâtaka (ii.257<sup>13</sup>), and constituting Birth-Story 244.</small></p>
 
 <p>   "<i>What he sees he does not wish for.</i>" This was related by The Teacher while dwelling in Jetavana monastery, and it was concerning a certain wandering ascetic who ran away.</p>
 
 <p>   It seems this ascetic had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions; and coming to Sâvatthi, he inquired, "Who is able to debate with me?" On hearing it said, "The Supreme Buddha is able," he went to Jetavana monastery, surrounded by a crowd of people. There he saw The Blessed One in the midst of the four classes of his disciples teaching them the Doctrine; and he propounded to him his questions.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Teacher answered him, and in return asked, "What constitutes a unit?" And he, being unable to reply, rose up and ran away.</p>
 
 <p>   And they of the assembly said,--</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Sir, you silenced the wandering ascetic with the question concerning the unit."</p>
 
 <p>   Said The Teacher,--</p>
 
 <p>   "Not now for the first time, O lay disciples, have I silenced him with the question concerning the unit; formerly also did I do so."</p>
 
 <p>   So saying, he related the by-gone occurrence:--</p>
 
 <p>   Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was ruling at Benares, the Future Buddha was born in the family of a Brahman of that kingdom. When he was come of age, he renounced pleasures and adopted the life of a holy recluse, and dwelt for a long time in the Himalaya Mountains. And descending from the hills, he made his abode in a leaf-hut close by a market-village, at a bend of the Ganges.</p>
 
 <p>   And a certain wandering ascetic who had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions,</p>

 <p>came to that market-village, and inquired, "Is there any one here able to debate with me?" And hearing that the Future Buddha was able, he went to his dwelling-place, surrounded by a crowd of people, and greeting him politely, sat down.</p>
 
 <p>   And the Future Buddha said to him,--</p>
 
 <p>   "Will you have a drink of Ganges water, fragrant with the scent of the forest?"</p>
 
 <p>   Thereupon the wandering ascetic began volubly to debate, saying,--</p>
 
 <p>   "What is the Ganges? Is the sand the Ganges? Is the water the Ganges? Is the hither bank the Ganges? Is the further bank the Ganges?"</p>
 
 <p>   But the Future Buddha said to him,--</p>
 
 <p>   "If you except the water, the sand, the hither bank, and the further bank, where can you find any Ganges?"</p>
 
 <p>   The wandering ascetic was confounded, and rose up and ran away.</p>
 
 <p>   When he was gone, the Future Buddha began teaching the Doctrine to the assembly that was seated about, and spoke</p>
 
 <p>   the following stanzas:--</p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="5">

 </small><p>   <i>What he sees</i>:- The water etc. which he sees, he does not wish to regard as the Ganges.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>But something that he does not see</i>:--But he wishes for a Ganges he does not see, for one abstracted from water etc.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>Methinks that he will wander long</i>:--Methinks thus: "This wandering ascetic, in his search for such a Ganges, will wander long; or if, in</p>

 </small><p>the same manner as for this Ganges abstracted from water etc., he is in search of an Ego abstracted from form etc., he will wander a long time in the round of rebirth."</p>
 
 <p>   <i>And what he wishes, not obtain</i>:--Although he wander a long time, he will not find such a Ganges or Ego as he is looking for.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>What he gets</i>:--He is not pleased with the water, or the form etc., which he gets.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>No sooner gained, it meets his scorn</i>:--Being thus not pleased with what he gets, any longed-for success which he gains, this he scorns and despises, saying, "What do I care for this?"</p>
 
 <p>   <i>Insatiate are wishes all</i>: -Wish or desire is insatiate, as it continually seeks for a fresh object which it scorns as soon as obtained.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>The wish-free, therefore, we adore</i>:--Therefore we adore The Buddhas and all others who are free from wishes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>   When The Teacher had given this instruction, he identified the characters in the Birth-Story: "The wandering ascetic of that existence was the wandering ascetic of this. The anchorite was I myself."</p>
