 <p>   Now at that time a certain priest had been killed by the bite of a snake, and when they announced the matter to The Blessed One, he said:</p>
 
 <p>   "Surely now, O priests, that priest never suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For if, O priests, that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. And what are the four royal families of the snakes? The Virûpakkhas are a royal family of snakes; the Erâpathas are a royal family of snakes; the Chabyâputtas are a royal family of snakes; the Kanhâgotamakas are a royal family of snakes. Surely, now, O priests, that priest did not suffuse the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For surely, O priests, if that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. I enjoin, O priests, that ye suffuse these four royal families of the snakes with your friendliness; and that ye sing a song of defence for your protection and safeguard. After this manner, O priests, shall ye sing:</p>
