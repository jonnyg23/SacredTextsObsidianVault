 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 91. HEAVEN NOT THE HIGHEST GOOD.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Anguttara-Nikâya (iii.18).</small></p>
 
 <p>   "If wandering ascetics, O priests, members of another sect, were to say to you, 'Sirs, is it in order to be reborn in the world of the gods that the monk Gotama leads a holy life?' would ye not, O priests, if that question were put to you, be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, Reverend Sir."</p>
 
 <p>   "So it appears, O priests, that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of life in heaven, heavenly beauty, heavenly happiness, heavenly glory; that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of heavenly power. But much more, O priests, should ye be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the body; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the voice; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the mind."</p>
