 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 99. THE ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE ORDER.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Culla-Vagga (x.1<sup>1</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   At that time The Buddha, The Blessed One, was dwelling among the Sakkas at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park. Then drew near Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, she stood respectfully at one side. And standing respectfully at one side, Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   And a second time Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   And a third time Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   "Enough, O Gotamid, do not ask that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   Then thought Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid, "The Blessed One permitteth not that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata;" and she was sorrowful, sad,</p>

 <p>and tearful, and wept. And saluting The Blessed One, and keeping her right side toward him, she departed.</p>
 
 <p>   Then The Blessed One, after dwelling at Kapilavatthu as long as he wished, departed on his wanderings toward Vesâlî and wandering from place to place, he came to where Vesâlî was. And there The Blessed One dwelt at Vesâlî in Great Wood, in Pagoda Hall.</p>
 
 <p>   Then Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid had her hair cut off, put on yellow garments, and with a number of Sakka women departed towards Vesâlî and going from place to place, she drew near to where Vesâlî was, and Great Wood, and Pagoda Hall. And Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen feet, and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stood weeping outside in the entrance porch.</p>
 
 <p>   Now the venerable Ânanda saw Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen feet, and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stand weeping outside in the entrance porch. And he spoke to Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Wherefore dost thou, O Gotamid, with swollen feet, and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stand weeping outside in the entrance porch?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Because, alas! O Ânanda, reverend sir, The Blessed One permitteth not that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   "In that case, O Gotamid, stay thou here a moment, and I will beseech The Blessed One that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>
 
 <p>   Then the venerable Ânanda drew near to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Sir, here this Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid with swollen feet, and covered with dust, sorrowful, sad, and tearful, stands weeping outside in the entrance porch, and says that The Blessed One permitteth not that women retire</p>

 <p>   "Enough, Ânanda, do not ask that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>

 <p>   Then thought the venerable Ânanda, "The Blessed One permitteth not that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata; what if now, by another route, I beseech The Blessed One that women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata?"</p>
 
 <p>   Then the venerable Ânanda spoke to The Blessed One as follows:</p>
 
 <p>   "Are women competent, Reverend Sir, if they retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata, to attain to the fruit of conversion, to attain to the fruit of once returning, to attain to the fruit of never returning, to attain to saintship?"</p>

 <p>   "Since, then, Reverend Sir, women are competent, if they retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata, to attain to the fruit of conversion, to attain to the fruit of once returning, to attain to the fruit of never returning, to attain to saintship, consider, Reverend Sir, how great a benefactress Mahâ-Pajâpatî the Gotamid has been. She is the sister of the mother of The Blessed One, and as foster-mother, nurse, and giver of milk, she suckled The Blessed One on the death of his mother. Pray, Reverend Sir, let women retire from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata."</p>

 <p>   "If, Ânanda, women had not retired from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata, religion, Ânanda, would long endure; a thousand years would the Good Doctrine abide. But since, Ânanda, women have now retired from household life to the houseless one, under the Doctrine and Discipline announced by The Tathâgata, not long, Ânanda, will religion endure; but five hundred years, Ânanda, will the Good Doctrine abide. Just as, Ânanda, those families which consist of many women and few men are easily overcome by burglars, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, when women retire from household life to the houseless one, under a doctrine and discipline, that religion does not long endure. Just as, Ânanda, when the disease called mildew falls upon a flourishing field of rice, that field of rice does not long endure, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, when women retire from household life to the houseless one, under a doctrine and discipline, that religion does not long endure. Even as, Ânanda, when the disease called rust falls upon a flourishing field of sugar-cane, that field of sugar-cane does not long endure, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, when women retire from household life to the houseless one, under a doctrine and discipline, that religion does not long endure. And just as, Ânanda, to a large pond a man would prudently build a dike, in order that the water might not transgress its bounds, in exactly the same way, Ânanda, have I prudently laid down eight weighty regulations, not to be transgressed as long as life shall last."</p>
