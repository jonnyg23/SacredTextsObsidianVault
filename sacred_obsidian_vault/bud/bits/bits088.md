 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 88. THE COLORLESS LIFE.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Milindapañha (76<sup>23</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   Said the king, "Bhante Nâgasena, what is the difference between one who has passion and one who is free from passion?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, the one clings, the other does not cling."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, what do you mean by 'clings' and 'does not cling'?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, the one covets, the other does not covet."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, this is the way I look at the matter: both he who has passion and he who is free from passion have the same wish, that his food, whether hard or soft, should be good; neither wishes for what is bad."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, he that is not free from passion experiences both the taste of that food, and also passion due to that taste; while he who is free from passion experiences the taste of that food, but no passion due to that taste."</p>
 
 <p>   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."</p>
