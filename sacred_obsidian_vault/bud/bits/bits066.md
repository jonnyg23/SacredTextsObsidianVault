 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 66. SPIRITUAL LAW IN THE NATURAL WORLD.</p>
 
 <p align="center">[THE FIRST HIGH POWER.]</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Milindapañha (p. 82<sup>12</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   Said the king, "Bhante Nâgasena, how far is it hence to the Brahma-world?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, it is a long way hence to the Brahma-world. If a rock of the size of a pagoda were to fall thence, and descend forty-eight thousand leagues in a day and a night, it would reach the earth in four months' time."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante Nâgasena, you priests say as follows: 'As quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or might bend his stretched-out arm, even so a priest who possesses magical power and has obtained the mastery over his mind, can disappear from the continent of India and reappear in the Brahma-world,' This I cannot believe, that he should go so very quickly so many hundreds of leagues."</p>
 
 <p>   Said the elder, "Your majesty, in what country were you born?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, there is an island named Alexandria, and there was I born."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, how far is it hence to Alexandria?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, it is about two hundred leagues."</p>
 
 <p>   "Call to mind, your majesty, something you may have done there."</p>
 
 <p>   "Yes, bhante, I am doing so."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, you have gone those two hundred leagues very nimbly."</p>
 
 <p>   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   Said the king, "Bhante Nâgasena, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, which would arrive first?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, they would take the same length of time."</p>
 
 <p>   "Give an illustration."</p>

 <p>   "Your majesty, in what city were you born?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, there is a town called Kalasi, and there was I born."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, how far is it hence to the town of Kalasi?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, it is about two hundred leagues."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, how far is it hence to Cashmere?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, it is twelve leagues."</p>
 
 <p>   "Be so good, your majesty, as to think of the town of Kalasi."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, I have thought of it."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, be so good as to think of Cashmere."</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, I have thought of it."</p>
 
 <p>   "Your majesty, which took the longer to think of?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, it took the same length of time."</p>
 
 <p>   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, it would take them the same length of time."</p>
 
 <p>   "Give another illustration."</p>
 
 <p>   "What do you say to this, your majesty? Two birds are flying through the air; one settles on a high tree, and the second on a low one. If now they have alighted at the same time, which one's shadow will first reach the ground?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Bhante, both shadows will reach the ground at the same time."</p>
 
 <p>   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, it would take them the same length of time."</p>
 
 <p>   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."</p>
