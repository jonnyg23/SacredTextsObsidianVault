 <p>"<i>See that twice-born bird</i>," <i>etc</i>.--This story the Master told while staying in Jetavana, about a hypocrite. When he was brought before the Master, the Master said, "Brethren, he was a hypocrite of old just as he is now," and told the following story.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>

 <p>[234] Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Fish in a certain pond in the Himalaya region, and a great shoal went with him. Now a Crane desired to eat the fish. So in a place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their guard <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">1</font></a>. At the same moment the Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first stanza:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"See that twice-born <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">2</font></a> bird, how white--<br>   Like a water-lily seeming;<br> Wings outspread to left and right--<br>   Oh, how pious! dreaming, dreaming!"</small></div>  
 <p>Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second stanza:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"What he is ye do not know,<br>   Or you would not sing his praises.<br> He is our most treacherous foe;<br>   That is why no wing he raises."</small></div>  
 <p>Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
 <p>When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"This hypocrite was the Crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="j2089.htm#fr_132">162:2</a> <i>dijo</i> is used of a bird as born in the egg and from the egg. It is also applied to Brahmins, and so conveys an additional notion of piety.</p>
