 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">APPENDIX</h3>  
 <p>[<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">As</span> an epilogue to the <i>Bodhi-charyāvatāra</i>, I append a translation of the Kārikās, or metrical summary of the main themes of Śānti-deva's other great work, the <i>Śikshā-samuchchaya</i>. These verses consist of twenty-eight stanzas in the <i>anushṭubh</i> metre, and may be taken as an epitome of the <i>Bodhi-charyāvatāra</i>.]</p>  
 <p>Since both I and my fellow-creatures dread and hate pain, what is the peculiar quality of my Self, that I should care for it, rather than for my fellow-men?</p>  
 <p>He that would make an end of sorrow and come to the bound of happiness must stablish firmly the root of Faith and immovably set his thought upon Enlightenment.</p>  
 <p>The Bodhi-sattva's rule of holiness developed from the Mahā-yāna. Therefore one should know its principles, and so be free from evil.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>Surrender to all creatures thine own person <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a> and thy pleasures, yea, and thy righteousness too, in past, present, and future time; guard them, and increase thy holiness.</p>  
 <p>For the enjoyment of fellow-creatures are sacrificed our own persons and the like. If they be not guarded, how can they be enjoyed? and can that be a gift that is not enjoyed?</p>  
 <p>Therefore to the end that fellow-creatures may have the enjoyment thereof, one should protect his own person and the like, by leaving never the Blest Friend and by studying ever the Scriptures.</p>  
 <p>Now what means it to guard one's own person? to shun mishap. How is this all found? by shunning fruitless effort.</p>  
 <p>Fulfil this work ever by mindfulness. From deep reverence springs mindfulness; and reverence, the glory of the chastened spirit, arises from an understanding zeal.</p>  
 <p>"He that hath concentred thought understands</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>what is as it verily is," said the Saint. Let the spirit turn away from outward action, and fall never away from its stillness.</p>  
 <p>Steadfast throughout, mild of spirit, one Should by gentle address win over worthy men, and thus become acceptable.</p>  
 <p>The worldly folk who scorn the scion of the Conqueror and accept him not shall be broiled in all the hells, like fire hidden under ash.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the Conqueror in the <i>Ratna-megha</i> has told in brief the holy rule: "Heedfully avoid that which gives displeasure to thy fellow-creatures." <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thus to care for one's own person with medicines, clothing, and the like, if it be to indulge the lust of the flesh, leads to grievous misfortune.</p>  
 <p>"Let man set himself to good deeds, and withal know the mean throughout." Through this precept it is easy for him to guard his enjoyment.</p>  
 <p>By quenching the lust for issues of thine own advantage, thy righteousness will be well guarded. Regret not thy deeds, nor make a public talk of them.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>The Bodhi-sattva will dread gain and honour, will shun exaltation; he will have glad faith in the Law, and dismiss doubts,</p>  
 <p>When the body is made pure, it becomes wholesome for creatures to enjoy, like perfect spotless rice.</p>  
 <p>As a crop of grain overgrown by weeds sinks under disease, and thrives not, so a scion of the Buddha, if overcome by sin, cannot grow in grace.</p>  
 <p>What is the "cleansing of our person"? Cleansing it of evil and sin, in obedience to the words of the Enlightened. If this endeavour be lacking, hell awaits us.</p>  
 <p>Let men be long-suffering, and fain to hear the Law, then let them withdraw to the forest, strain the thought on concentred effort, and ponder upon the uncleanness of the flesh and the like.</p>  
 <p>Understand how to make clean thy enjoyments, until thy soul be cleansed. Make thy merit pure by deeds full of the spirit of tenderness and the Void. <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>Full many there are who will take from thee. If thou hast but little, what of that? if it gives not full satisfaction, then it must be increased.</p>  
 <p>What is increase of the body? increase of strength and energy<i>.</i> Increase of enjoyment is from almsgiving full of the spirit of tenderness and the. Void.</p>  
 <p>Firstly should a man with care establish firmly his resolution and purpose; then with an attendant spirit of tenderness, he should strive to increase his merit.</p>  
 <p>The rule of right conduct—worship and the like—should ever be reverently observed. Let faith and the like be always practised, likewise brotherly love and the remembrance of the Buddha.</p>  
 <p>In short, the weal of fellow-beings in all conditions, the godly gift without worldly desire, and the Thought of Enlightenment cause righteousness to increase.</p>  
 <p>Perfection arises from constancy in the heedful effort to make right renunciations, by remembrance, by attention, and by true meditation.</p>
