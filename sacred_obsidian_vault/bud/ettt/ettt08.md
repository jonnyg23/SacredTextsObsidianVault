 <p>The Guru says to the disciples:</p>  
 <p>O well-gifted disciples, these sixty Blood-Drinking Deities are not something else, they are one's own kleśas-group, purified but not abandoned. The insubstantial or the perceiver that is devoid of any self-nature awareness manifests itself as the sixty Blood-Drinking Deities. As illustrated, in the Palace-Beyond-Measure in one's skull-brain, a group of Blood-Drinking Deities now actually and vividly dwell<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:10">10</a><a name="an_r_7:10"></a>. The forty-two Peaceful Deities with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>their illuminate bodies, all now dwell in the Dharma Chakra in the heart center. Furthermore, all the hairs over your body are identical with the nature of Db’a-wo (Brave Deities). All the Pranas are the nature of Dakinis, all the White-Drops<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:11">11</a><a name="an_r_7:11"></a> manifest in the form of the infinite Peaceful and Wrathful Sambhogakaya of the Father Buddhas. All the Red Drops<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:12">12</a><a name="an_r_7:12"></a> (Ragda) manifest in the form of the infinite Peaceful and Wrathful Sambhogakaya of the Mother Buddhas. The numerous nadis<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:13">13</a><a name="an_r_7:13"></a> of the body are the Dakinis. Therefore, your very body itself is the nature of the Mandala of the Peaceful and Wrathful Buddhas. Hence, you should never despise, abuse, or injure your body, nor should you overstrain your body, practice asceticism, or commit suicide. When you eat or drink you should think that this is the Tantric Sacrament and duly make the offering. If you remain without attachment, you may always wear fire and lovely clothes and adorn yourself as a manner of</p>  <h3 align="center">Folio 43</h3>  
 <p>[Continuing the text of Folio 42.]</p>  
 <p>practicing Tantric offerings. At the time of death, the Peaceful and Wrathful Buddhas will come out of your body, extending over all space; thereupon the Bardo visions will begin. Remember! At that time do not be frightened or terrified by the thundering voices and the Three Lights! You should remember that all these Buddhas are your tutelary Buddhas whose initiations I am right now giving to you! You should remember and recognize them. As soon as you recognize them, you will be instantaneously emancipated!</p>  
 <p>Thus the Pointing-Out demonstration is extensively given to the disciples.</p>

 <p>The foregoing initiation-ritual is given to the disciples to make them understand the teachings of initiation; as said in the Prime King-Initiation Tantra of Vajrasattva:</p>  
 <p>The Mandala-Offering practice is to be done [now.]</p>

 <p>The Vajrasattava gives the Skull-Initiation,</p>  
 <p>To elucidate the symbolic teachings.</p>

 <p>(The text written on the reverse side of Folio 43.)</p>  
 <p>Thus says the <i>Tantra of Vajrasattva</i>.</p>  
 <p>Of this Skull-Initiation (a simpler type or Rite-Free Initiation), that Tantra gives the following explanation:</p>  
 <p>"The Initiation tells the disciples whether the Outer Objects in the material world and Inner Essence<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:14">14</a><a name="an_r_7:14"></a> within oneself are existent or non-existent, and in what sense they do or do not exist, by giving many symbols and explanations, such as the Sumeru Mountain, the Four Continents and the Vase Buddhas. In the Wisdom Initiation, the Thunderbolt, the Precious Wheel, the Cross-Thunderbolt, the Three-Pointed Knife, the Purba Dagger, the bow and arrows, the mirror, the forms and colors—these things are shown to the disciples, to give them a sagacious view, by the Guru in the Initiation ritual." Thus states the Tantra.</p>  
 <p>The Tantra explains the Extreme Rite-Free Initiation in the terms of the Secret Initiations; its objective is to elucidate</p>

 <p>self-Illumination—if one knows himself, he has attained the Secret Initiation.</p>  
 <p>The Tantra also says:</p>  
 <p>"If one knows one thing he knows all.<br>  O, marvelous is the Nature of Equality!<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:15">15</a><a name="an_r_7:15"></a><br>  If existent—Equality from the beginning!<br>  If non-existent—Equality from the beginning!<br>  If abstract—Equality from the beginning!<br>  If concrete—still Equality from the beginning!<br>  If one realizes the Nature of Equality,<br>  He has attained the Secret Initiation!<br>  Oh, marvelous is the Nature of Equality!"</p>  
 <p>Now, the ultimate-Rite-Free Initiation:</p>  
 <p>As said in the Tantra: "Through the Words-Initiation the Non-ego truth is elucidated to the disciples: Wherever there is ego, there are always confusions (Saṃsāra). The word of no words is the highest initiation. Without I, without ego, none sinks into Saṃsāra!"</p>  
 <p>Now, the Great Vase Initiation with Rite, the Rite-Free Initiation, the Extreme Rite-Free Initiation, and the Ultimate Rite-Free Initiation are all given to you; thus the sins, hindrances, and habitual thoughts of your body, mouth, and mind are all cleansed and actually become the Four Bodies of Buddha. Hereafter, you will benefit sentient beings in a natural way, without any <a href="errata.htm#14">strenuous</a> effort.</p>  
 <p>To obtain pardon and give thanks, the Mandala should be offered; the assemblage should be <a href="errata.htm#15">entertained</a> and exalted with dancing and singing. What remains after the festival should be given away as charity.</p>  
 <p>Those who want to have a comprehensive sacramental</p>

 <p>festival and celebration should consult the Annotations of the Four Initiation Rituals.</p>  
 <p><i>Samaya Chia Chia Chia!</i></p>  
 <p>May the message of the Argument-Free Adi Doctrine<a href="ettt08.htm#an_n_7:16">16</a><a name="an_r_7:16"></a> reach all the corners of the world at all times. May this teaching be spread and magnified on the earth and last for ages.</p>  
 <p>This is the teaching from the Treasury of Garma Linpa, the accomplished Yogi.</p>  
 <p>Blessings to all!</p>

 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:1">1</a><a name="an_n_7:1"></a>. The manuscript of these initiations presents a series of colored images of god-forms, with explanatory text on the verso sides and on supplementary folios containing the most profound ideas, most explicitly expressed, of any of the seven initiation texts here given.—Ed.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:2">2</a><a name="an_n_7:2"></a>. The translator believes the folios of the other four Buddhas are missing. The first few lines of the text are indiscernible.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:3">3</a><a name="an_n_7:3"></a>. <i>Fiery Water:</i> For human beings, fire is fire and water is water. This is not so for sentient beings in Hell. For them, cool water they try to drink turns to fire, and fire by which they try to warm themselves turns to cold water. Hence the term "Fiery Water" is used to convey the absence of self-nature in this nether-world phenomenon.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:4">4</a><a name="an_n_7:4"></a>. <i>Cross Symbols (Rgya-gram):</i> In Tibetan, this term may refer either to the symbol of the crossed thunderbolts or that symbol we call the swastika. Here it means crossed thunderbolts.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:5">5</a><a name="an_n_7:5"></a>. <i>Pointing-Out Practice:</i> This is the practice by which the Guru points out (illustrates) to the disciple, during the initiation, his original Buddha-nature. This is a special practice of the Red and White Schools of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:6">6</a><a name="an_n_7:6"></a>. <i>Alaya Bodhi Heart:</i> "Alaya" is the term meaning "foundation of all." Here the term is used in connection with Bodhi-heart, implying that the Vow of Bodhisattva is the foundation and source of all Buddhist teachings.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:7">7</a><a name="an_n_7:7"></a>. This refers to the most active and versatile consciousness, generally called mental, which Buddhists classify as the Sixth Consciousness.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:8">8</a><a name="an_n_7:8"></a>. <i>Four Extremes:</i> (1) The Extreme of Existence; (z) The Extreme of Non-Existence; (3) The Extreme of both Existence and Non-Existence; (4) The Extremes of neither Existence nor Non-Existence.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:9">9</a><a name="an_n_7:9"></a>. <i>Thought of the Four Births:</i> From the transcendental viewpoint, there is no birth nor death. The Four Births of Saṃsara are dreamlike and unreal; they are merely thoughts, not the real beings.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:10">10</a><a name="an_n_7:10"></a> This is the esoteric teaching of this initiation: that all the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Wrathful Buddhas are reflected or manifested through the psychic center in the head.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:11">11</a><a name="an_n_7:11"></a>. <i>White Drops:</i> The life-force (physically, semen) of the male.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:12">12</a><a name="an_n_7:12"></a>. <i>Red Drops:</i> The life-force of the female.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:13">13</a><a name="an_n_7:13"></a>. <i>Nadis (Skt.):</i> Follicles; all the tubes and nerves in the body; Tibetan, Riser. [Actually the nadis (rTsa) are not part of the physical body, but are subtle channels for the conveyance of prana.—<i>Ed</i>.]</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:14">14</a><a name="an_n_7:14"></a>. <i>Inner Essence</i>, here, refers to the disciple's consciousness.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:15">15</a><a name="an_n_7:15"></a>. The Nature of Equality is one of the most important aspects of the Prajna-Paramita. From the viewpoint of absolute enlightenment, all things appear equal. [Instead of "equal," to say "partaking of the same ultimate nature" would probably be more accurate.—<i>Ed</i>.] Therefore, Tantrism <a href="errata.htm#16">declares that</a> Nirvana is Saṃsāra and Saṃsara is Nirvana.</p>  
 <p><a href="ettt08.htm#an_r_7:16">16</a><a name="an_n_7:16"></a>. <i>Argument-Free Adi Doctrine:</i> Traditionally, this term carries two meanings: (1) It refers to the nature of the Adi Doctrine beyond arguments, opinions, and "play words"; (2) It refers to the tradition of the Red School which, in contradistinction to the Yellow School, disregards scholastic opinions and arguments.</p>
