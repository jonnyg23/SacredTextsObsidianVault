   <h3 align="center">VARGA 9. THE MISSION TO SEEK THE PRINCE.</h3>  
 <p>The king now suppressing (regulating) his grief, urged an his great teacher and chief minister, as one urges on with whip a ready horse, to hasten onwards as the rapid stream; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 665</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst they fatigued, yet with unflagging effort, come to the place of the sorrow-giving grove; then laying on one side the five outward marks <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">1</font></a> of dignity and regulating well their outward gestures, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 666</font></span></p>  
 <p>They entered the Brahmans' quiet hermitage, and paid reverence to the <i>Ri</i>shis. They, on their part, begged them to be seated, and repeated the law for their peace and comfort. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 667</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then forthwith they addressed the <i>Ri</i>shis and said: 'We have on our minds a subject on which we would ask (for advice). There is one who is called <i>S</i>uddhodana râ<i>g</i>a, a descendant of the famous Ikshvâku family, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 668</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We are his teacher and his minister, who instruct him in the sacred books as required. The king indeed is like Indra (for dignity); his son, like <i>K</i>e-yan-to (<i>G</i>ayanta), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 669</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In order to escape old age, disease, and death, has become a hermit, and depends on this; on his account have we come hither, with a view to let your worships know of this.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 670</font></span></p>  
 <p>Replying, they said: 'With respect to this youth,.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a></p>  
 <p>has he long arms and the signs of a great man? Surely he is the one who, enquiring into our practice, discoursed so freely on the matter of life and death. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 671</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He has gone to the abode of Arâ<i>d</i>a, to seek for a complete mode of escape.' Having received this certain information, respectfully considering the urgent commands of the anxious king, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 672</font></span></p>  
 <p>They dared not hesitate in their undertaking, but straightway took the road and hastened on. Then seeing the wood in which the royal prince dwelt, and him, deprived of all outward marks of dignity, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 673</font></span></p>  
 <p>His body still glorious with lustrous shining, as when the sun comes forth from the black cloud <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">1</font></a>; then the religious teacher of the country and the great minister holding to the true law, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 674</font></span></p>  
 <p>Put off from them their courtly dress, and descending from the chariot gradually advanced, like the royal Po-ma-ti (? Bharata) and the <i>Ri</i>shi Vasish<i>th</i>a, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 675</font></span></p>  
 <p>Went through the woods and forests, and seeing the royal prince Râma, each according to his own prescribed manner, paid him reverence, as he advanced to salute him; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 676</font></span></p>  
 <p>Or as <i>S</i>ukra, in company with Aṅgiras, with earnest heart paid reverence, and sacrificed to Indra râ<i>g</i>a. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 677</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the royal prince in return paid reverence to the . royal teacher and the great minister, as the divine Indra placed at their ease <i>S</i>ukra and Aṅgiras; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 678</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then, at his command, the two men seated themselves before the prince, as Pou-na (Punarvasû) and Pushya, the twin stars attend beside the moon; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 679</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the Purohita and the great minister respectfully explained to the royal prince, even as Pi-li-po-ti (B<i>ri</i>haspati) spoke to that <i>G</i>ayanta: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 680</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Your royal father, thinking of the prince, is pierced in heart, as with an iron point; his mind distracted, raves in solitude; he sleeps upon the dusty ground; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 681</font></span></p>  
 <p>'By night and day he adds to his sorrowful reflections; his tears flow down like the incessant rain; and now to seek you out, he has sent us hither. Would that you would listen with attentive mind; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 682</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We know that you delight to act religiously; it is certain, then, without a doubt, this is not the time for you to be a hermit (to enter the forest wilds); a feeling of deep pity consumes our heart! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 683</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You, if you be indeed, moved by religion, ought to feel some pity for our case; let your kindly feelings flow abroad, to comfort us who are worn at heart; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 684</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Let not the tide of sorrow and of sadness completely overwhelm the outlets of our heart; as the torrents (which roll down) the grassy mountains; or the calamities of tempest, fiery heat, and lightning; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 685</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For so the grieving heart has these four sorrows, turmoil and drought; passion and overthrow. But come! return to your native place, the time will arrive when you can go forth again as a recluse. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 686</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But now to disregard your family duties, to turn against father and mother, how can this be called</p>  
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p>  
 <p>love and affection? that love which overshadows and embraces all. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 687</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Religion requires not the wild solitudes; you can practise a hermit's duties in your home; studiously thoughtful, diligent in expedients, this is to lead a hermit's life in truth. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 688</font></span></p>  
 <p>A shaven head, and garments soiled with dirt,--to wander by yourself through desert wilds,--this is but to encourage constant fears, and cannot be rightly called "an awakened hermit's (life)." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 689</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Would rather we might take you by the hand, and sprinkle <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a>water on your head, and crown you with a heavenly diadem, and place you underneath a flowery canopy, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 690</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That all eyes might gaze with eagerness upon you; after this, in truth, we would leave our home with joy. The former kings Teou-lau-ma (Druma?), A-neou-<i>k</i>e-o-sa (Anu<i>g</i>asa or Anu<i>d</i>âsa), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 691</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Po-<i>k</i>e-lo-po-yau (Va<i>g</i>rabâhu), Pi-po-to-’an-ti (Vaibhrâ<i>g</i>a), Pi-ti-o-ke-na (Vatâ<i>g</i>ana?), Na-lo-sha-po-lo (Narasavara?), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 692</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All these several kings refused not the royal crown, the jewels, and the ornaments of person; their hands and feet were adorned with gems, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 693</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Around them were women to delight and please, these things they cast not from them, for the sake of escape; you then may also come back home, and undertake both necessary duties <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 694</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Your mind prepare itself in higher law, whilst for the sake of earth you wield the sceptre; let there be no more weeping, but comply with what we say, and let us publish it; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 695</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And having published it with your authority, then you may return and receive respectful welcome. Your father and your mother, for your sake, in grief shed tears like the great ocean; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 696</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having no stay and no dependence now--no source from which the <i>S</i>âkya stem may grow--you ought, like the captain of the ship, to bring it safely across to a place of safety. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 697</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The royal prince Pi-san-ma, as also Lo-me-po-ti, they respectfully attended to the command of their father, you also should do the <i>s</i>ame! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 698</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Your loving mother who cherished you so kindly, with no regard for self, through years of care, as the cow deprived of her calf, weeps and laments, forgetting to eat or sleep; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 699</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You surely ought to return to her at once, to protect her life from evil; as a solitary bird, away from its fellows, or as the lonely elephant, wandering through the jungle, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 700</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Losing the care of their young, ever think of protecting and defending them, so you the only child, young and defenceless, not knowing what you do, bring trouble and solicitude; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 701</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Cause, then, this sorrow to dissipate itself; as one who rescues the moon <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">1</font></a> from being devoured, so do you reassure the men and women of the land, and remove from them the consuming grief, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 702</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(And suppress) the sighs that rise like breath to heaven, which cause the darkness that obscures their sight; seeking you, as water, to quench the fire, the fire quenched, their eyes shall open.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 703</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>Bodhisattva, hearing of his father the king, experienced the greatest distress of mind, and sitting still, gave himself to reflection; and then, in due course, replied respectfully: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 704</font></span></p>  
 <p>'I know indeed that my royal father is possessed of a loving and deeply <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a> considerate mind, but my fear of birth, old age, disease, and death has led me to disobey, and disregard his extreme kindness. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 705</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Whoever neglects right consideration about his present life, and because he hopes to escape in the end, therefore disregards all precautions (in the present), on this man comes the inevitable doom of death. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 706</font></span></p>  
 <p>'It is the knowledge of this, therefore, that weighs . with me, and after long delay has constrained me to a hermit's life; hearing of my father, the king, and his grief, my heart is affected with increased love; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 707</font></span></p>  
 <p>But yet, all is like the fancy of a dream, quickly reverting to nothingness. Know then, without fear of contradiction, that the nature of existing things is not uniform; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 708</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The cause of sorrow is not necessarily  <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">2</font></a> the relationship of child with parent, but that which produces the pain of separation, results from the influence of delusion <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 709</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As men going along a road suddenly meet mid-way with others, and then a moment more are separated, each one going his own way <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 710</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>'So by the force of concomitance, relationships are framed, and then, according to each one's destiny <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">1</font></a>, there is separation; he who thoroughly investigates this false connection of relationship ought not to cherish in himself grief; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 711</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In this world there is rupture of family love, in another life (world) it is sought for again; brought together for a moment, again rudely divided <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">2</font></a>, everywhere the fetters of kindred are formed <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">3</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 712</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Ever being bound, and ever being loosened! who can sufficiently lament such constant separations; born into the world <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and then gradually changing, constantly separated by death and then born again. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 713</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All things which exist in time must perish <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the forests and mountains all things thus exist <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">6</font></a>; in time are born all sensuous things (things possessing the five desires), so is it both with worldly substance <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">7</font></a> and with time. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 714</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Because, then, death pervades all time, get rid of death <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">8</font></a>, and time will disappear. You desire to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>make me king, and it is difficult to resist the offices of love; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 715</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But as a disease (is difficult to bear) without medicine, so neither can I bear (this weight of dignity); in every condition, high or low, we find folly and ignorance, (and men) carelessly following the dictates of lustful passion; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 716</font></span></p>  
 <p>'At last, we come <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">1</font></a> to live in constant fear; thinking anxiously of the outward form, the spirit droops; following the ways of men  <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the mind resists the right <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">3</font></a>; but, the conduct of the wise is not so. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 717</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The sumptuously ornamented <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">4</font></a> and splendid palace (I look upon) as filled with fire; the hundred dainty dishes (tastes) of the divine kitchen, as mingled with destructive poisons; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 718</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The lily growing on the tranquil lake, in its midst harbours countless noisome insects; and so the towering abode of the rich is the house of calamity; the wise will not dwell therein. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 719</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In former times illustrious kings, seeing the many crimes of their home and country, affecting as with poison the dwellers therein, in sorrowful disgust sought comfort in seclusion <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">5</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 720</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We know, therefore, that the troubles of a royal estate are not to be compared with the repose of a religious life; far better dwell in the wild mountains <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and eat the herbs like the beasts of the field; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 721</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Therefore I dare not dwell in the wide <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">1</font></a> palace, for the black snake has its dwelling there. I reject the kingly estate and the five desires [desires of the senses], to escape such sorrows I wander thro’ the mountain wilds. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 722</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This, then, would be the consequence of compliance, that I; who, delighting in religion, am gradually getting wisdom <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">2</font></a>, should now quit these quiet woods, and returning home, partake of sensual pleasures, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 723</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And thus by night and day increase <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">3</font></a> my store of misery. Surely this is not what should be done! that the great leader of an illustrious tribe, having left his home from love of religion, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 724</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And for ever turned his back upon tribal honour <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">4</font></a>, desiring to confirm his purpose as a leader <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">5</font></a>,--that he,--discarding outward form, clad in religious garb, loving religious meditation, wandering thro’ the wilds,-- 725</p>  
 <p>'Should now reject his hermit vestment, tread down his sense of proper shame (and give up his aim). This, though I gained heaven's kingly state, cannot be done! how much less to gain an earthly, though distinguished <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">6</font></a>, home! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 726</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>'For having spued forth lust, passion, and ignorance, shall I return to feed upon it? as a man might go back to his vomit! such misery, how could I bear? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 727</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Like a man whose house has caught fire, by some expedient finds a way to escape, will such a man forthwith go back and enter it again? such conduct would disgrace a man <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">1</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 728</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So I, beholding the evils, birth, old age, and death, to escape the misery, have become a hermit; shall I then go back and enter in, and like a fool dwell in their company? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 729</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He who enjoys a royal estate and yet seeks rescue <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">2</font></a>, cannot dwell thus, this is no place for him; escape (rescue) is born from quietness and rest; to be a king is to add distress and poison; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 730</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To seek for rest and yet aspire to royal condition is but a contradiction, royalty and rescue, motion and rest, like fire and water, having two principles <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">3</font></a>, cannot be united. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 731</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So one resolved to seek escape cannot abide possessed of kingly dignity! and if you say a man may be a king <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and at the same time prepare deliverance for himself, 732}</p>  
 <p>'There is no certainty in this <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">5</font></a>! to seek certain</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>escape is not to risk it thus <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a>; it is through this uncertain frame of mind that once a man gone forth is led to go back home again; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 733</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But I, my mind is not uncertain <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a>; severing the baited hook <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">3</font></a> of relationship, with straightforward purpose <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">4</font></a>, I have left my home. Then tell me, why should I return again?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 734</font></span></p>  
 <p>The great minister, inwardly reflecting, (thought), 'The mind of the royal prince, my master <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">5</font></a>, is full of wisdom, and agreeable to virtue <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">6</font></a>, what he says is reasonable and fitly framed <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">7</font></a>.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 735</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then he addressed the prince and said: 'According to what your highness states, he who seeks religion must seek it rightly; but this is not the fitting time (for you); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 736</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Your royal father, old and of declining years, thinking of you his son, adds grief to grief; you say indeed, "I find my joy in rescue. To go back would be apostacy <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">8</font></a>." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 737</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But yet your joy denotes unwisdom <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">9</font></a>, and argues want of deep reflection; you do not see, because you seek the fruit, how vain to give up present duty <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">10</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 738</font></span></p>

 <p>'There are some who say, There is "hereafter <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a>;" others there are who say, "Nothing hereafter." So whilst this question hangs in suspense, why should a man give up his present pleasure? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 739</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If perchance there is "hereafter," we ought to bear (patiently) what it brings <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a>; if you say, "Hereafter is not <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">3</font></a>," then there is not either rescue (salvation)! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 740</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If you say, "Hereafter is," you would not say, "Salvation causes it <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">4</font></a>." As earth is hard, or fire is hot, or water moist, or wind is mobile, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 741</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"Hereafter" is just so. It has its own distinct nature. So when we speak of pure and impure, each comes from its own distinctive nature. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 742</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If you should say, "By some contrivance this can be removed," such an <a href="errata.htm#0">opinion</a> argues folly. Every root within the moral world <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">5</font></a> (world or domain of conduct) has its own nature predetermined; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 743</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Loving remembrance and forgetfulness, these have their nature fixed and positive; so likewise</p>

 <p>age, disease, and death, these sorrows, who can escape by strategy <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a>? (contrivance, upâya). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 744</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If you say, "Water can put out fire," or "Fire can cause water to boil and pass away," (then this proves only that) distinctive natures may be mutually destructive; but nature in harmony produces living things; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 745</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So man when first conceived within the womb, his hands, his feet, and all his separate members, his spirit and his understanding, of themselves are perfected; but who is he who does it? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 746</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Who is he that points the prickly thorn? This too is nature, self-controlling <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And take again the different kinds of beasts, these are what they are, without desire (on their part <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">3</font></a>); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 747</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And so, again, the heaven-born beings, whom the self-existent (I<i>s</i>vara) rules <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and all the world of his creation; these have no self-possessed power of expedients; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 748</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For if they had a means of causing birth, there would be also (means) for controlling death, and then what need of self-contrivance, or seeking for deliverance? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 749</font></span></p>  
 <p>'There are those who say, "I <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">5</font></a>" (the soul) is the cause of birth, and others who affirm, "I" (the soul) is the cause of death. There are some who say,</p>

 <p>'Thus one is born a fortunate child, removed from poverty, of noble family, or learned in testamentary lore of <i>Ri</i>shis, or called to offer mighty sacrifices to the gods, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 751</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Born in either state, untouched by poverty, then their famous name becomes to them "escape," their virtues handed down by name to us <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a>; yet if these attained their happiness (found deliverance), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 752</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Without contrivance of their own, how vain and fruitless is the toil of those who seek "escape." And you, desirous of deliverance, purpose to practise some high expedient, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 753</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Whilst your royal father frets and sighs; for a short while you have assayed the road, and leaving home have wandered thro’ the wilds, to return then would not now be wrong; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 754</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Of old, king Ambarîsha for a long while dwelt in the grievous forest, leaving his retinue and all his kinsfolk, but afterwards returned and took the royal office; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 755</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And so Râma, son of the king of the country, leaving his country occupied the mountains, but hearing he was acting contrary to usage <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a>, returned <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">4</font></a> and governed righteously. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 756</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And so the king of Sha-lo-po, called To-lo-ma (Druma) <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">1</font></a>, father and son, both wandered forth as hermits, but in the end came back again together; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 757</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So Po-’sz-tsau Muni (Vasish<i>th</i>a?), with On-tai-tieh (Âtreya?), in the wild mountains practising as Brahma<i>k</i>ârins, these too returned to their own country. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 758</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thus all these worthies of a by-gone age, famous for their advance in true religion, came back home and royally governed, as lamps enlightening the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 759</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Wherefore for you to leave the mountain wilds, religiously to rule, is not a crime.' The royal prince, listening to the great minister, loving words without excess of speaking, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 760</font></span></p>  
 <p>Full of sound argument, clear and unconfused, with no desire to wrangle after the way of the schools, with fixed purpose, deliberately speaking, thus answered the great minister: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 761</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The question of being and not-being is an idle one, only adding to the uncertainty of an unstable mind, and to talk of such matters I have no strong (fixed) inclination <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 762</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Purity of life, wisdom, the practice of asceticism <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">3</font></a>, these are matters to which I earnestly apply myself <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the world is full of empty studies (discoveries) which our teachers in their office skilfully involve; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 763</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But they are without any true principle, and I</p>

 <p>will none of them! The enlightened man distinguishes truth from falsehood; but how can truth <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">1</font></a> (faith) be born from such as those? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 764</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For they are like the man born blind, leading the blind man as a guide; as in the night, as in thick darkness [both wander on], what recovery is there for them? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 765</font></span></p>  
 <p>Regarding the question of the pure and impure, the world involved in self-engendered doubt cannot perceive the truth; better to walk along the way of purity, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 766</font></span></p>  
 <p>Or rather follow the pure law of self-denial, hate the practice of impurity, reflect on what was said of old <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">2</font></a>, not obstinate in one belief or one tradition, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 767</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With sincere (empty) mind, accepting all true words, and ever banishing sinful sorrow (i.e. sin, the cause of grief). Words which exceed sincerity (simplicity of purpose) are vainly (falsely) spoken; the wise man uses not such words. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 768</font></span></p>  
 <p>As to what you say of Râma and the rest, leaving their home, practising a pure life, and then returning to their country, and once more mixing themselves in sensual pleasures, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 769</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Such men as these walk vainly; those who are wise place no dependence on them. Now, for your sakes, permit me, briefly, to recount this one true principle (i.e. purpose) (of action): <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 770</font></span></p>  
 <p>"The sun, the moon may fall to earth, Sumeru and all the snowy mountains overturn, but I will never change my purpose; rather than enter a forbidden place, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 771</font></span></p>

 <p>'"Let me be cast into the fierce fire; not to accomplish rightly (what I have entered on), and to return once more to my own land, there to enter the fire of the five desires, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 772</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"Let it befall me as my own oath records:"--so spake the prince, his arguments as pointed as the brightness of the perfect sun; then rising up he passed some distance off.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 773</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Purohita and the minister, their words and discourse prevailing nothing, conversed together, after which, resolving to depart on their return, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 774</font></span></p>  
 <p>With great respect they quietly inform <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">1</font></a> the prince, not daring to intrude their presence on him further; and yet regarding the king's commands, not willing to return with unbecoming haste, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 775</font></span></p>  
 <p>They loitered quietly along the way, and whomsoever they encountered, selecting those who seemed like wise men, they interchanged such thoughts as move the learned, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 776</font></span></p>  
 <p>Hiding their true position, as men of title; then passing on, they speeded on their way.</p>
