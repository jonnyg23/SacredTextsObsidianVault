   <h3 align="center">VARGA 2. LIVING IN THE PALACE.</h3>  
 <p>And now in the household of <i>S</i>uddhodana râ<i>g</i>a, because of the birth of the royal prince, his clansmen and younger brethren (namesakes), with his ministers, were all generously disposed, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 127</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst elephants, horses and chariots and the wealth of the country and precious <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">2</font></a> vessels, daily increased and abounded, being produced wherever requisite <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 128</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>  
 <p>So too countless hidden treasures came of themselves from the earth. From the midst of the pure snowy mountains, a wild herd of white elephants, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 129</font></span></p>  
 <p>Without noise, of themselves, came; not curbed by any, self-subdued, every kind of colour’d <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1</font></a> horse, in shape and quality surpassingly excellent, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 130</font></span></p>  
 <p>With sparkling jewelled manes and flowing tails, came prancing round, as if with wings; these too, born in the desert, came at the right time, of themselves. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 131</font></span></p>  
 <p>A (herd of) pure-colour’d, well-proportioned cows, fat and fleshy, and remarkable for beauty, giving fragrant and pure milk with equal flow, came together in great number <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">2</font></a> at this propitious time: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 132</font></span></p>  
 <p>Enmity and envy gave way to peace; content and rest prevailed on every side, whilst there was closer union amongst the true of heart, discord and variance were entirely appeased; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 133</font></span></p>  
 <p>The gentle air distilled a seasonable rain, no crash of storm or tempest was heard, the springing seeds, not waiting for their time, grew up apace and yielded abundant increase; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 134</font></span></p>  
 <p>The five cereals grew ripe with scented grain, soft and glutinous, easy of digestion; all creatures big with young, possessed their bodies in ease and their frames well-gathered; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 135</font></span></p>  
 <p>All men, even those who had not received the seeds of instruction derived from the four holy</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>ones <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a>; all these, throughout the world, born under the control of selfish appetite, without any thought for others' goods, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 136</font></span></p>  
 <p>Had no proud, envious longings; no angry, hateful thoughts. All men and women <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a> were grave (profound) as the first man of the age (kalpa). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 137</font></span></p>  
 <p>All the temples of the gods and sacred shrines, the gardens, wells, and fountains, all these like things in heaven, produced of themselves, at the proper time, (their several adornments). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 138</font></span></p>  
 <p>There was no famishing hunger, the soldiers' weapons were at rest, all diseases disappeared; throughout the kingdom all the people were bound close in family love and friendship; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 139</font></span></p>  
 <p>Piously affectioned they indulged in mutual pleasures, there were no impure or polluting desires, they sought their daily gain righteously, no covetous money-loving spirit prevailed, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 140</font></span></p>  
 <p>But with religious purpose they gave liberally; there was no thought of any reward (return), but all practised the four rules of purity; and every hateful thought was suppressed and destroyed. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 141</font></span></p>  
 <p>Even as in days gone by, Manu râ<i>g</i>a begat a child (called) 'Brilliancy of the Sun,' on which there prevailed through the country great prosperity, and all Wickedness came to an end; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 142</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>So now the king having begotten a royal prince, these marks of prosperity were seen; and because of such a concourse of propitious signs, the child was named Siddhârtha <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 143</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now his royal mother, the queen Mâyâ, beholding her son born under such circumstances, beautiful as a child of heaven, adorned with every excellent distinction, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 144</font></span></p>  
 <p>From excessive joy which could not be controlled died, and was born in heaven <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then Pra<i>g</i>âpatî Gautamî, beholding the prince, like an angel, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 145</font></span></p>  
 <p>With beauty seldom seen on earth, seeing him thus born and now his mother dead, loved and nourished him as her own child; and the child regarded her as his mother. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 146</font></span></p>  
 <p>So as the light of the sun or the moon, little by little increases, the royal child also increased each day in every mental excellency and beauty of person; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 147</font></span></p>  
 <p>(His body exhaled) the perfume of priceless sandal wood, (decorated with) the famed <i>G</i>ambunada gold (gems); divine medicines (there were) to preserve him in health, glittering necklaces upon his person; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 148</font></span></p>  
 <p>The members of tributary states, hearing that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>the king had an heir born to him, sent their presents and gifts of various kinds, oxen, sheep, deer, horses, and chariots, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 149</font></span></p>  
 <p>Precious vessels and elegant ornaments, fit to delight the heart of the prince; but though presented with such pleasing trifles, the necklaces and other pretty ornaments, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 150</font></span></p>  
 <p>The mind (nature) of the prince was unmoved, his bodily frame small indeed, but his heart established; his mind at rest within its own high purposes <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">1</font></a>, was not to be disturbed by glittering baubles. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 151</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now he was brought to learn the useful arts, when lo! once instructed (at one hearing) he surpassed his teachers. His father, the king, seeing his exceeding talent, and his deep purpose to have done with the world and its allurements, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 152</font></span></p>  
 <p>Began to enquire as to the names of those in his tribe who were renowned for elegance and refinement. Elegant and graceful, and a lovely maiden, was she whom they called Ya<i>s</i>odharâ; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 153</font></span></p>  
 <p>In every way fitting to become a consort for the prince; and to allure by pleasant wiles his heart. The prince with a mind so far removed (from the world), with qualities so distinguished, and with so charming an appearance, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 154</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like the elder son of Brahmadeva, Sanatkumâra (She-na Kiu-ma-lo); the virtuous damsel, lovely and refined, gentle and subdued in manner; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 155</font></span></p>  
 <p>Majestic like the queen of heaven, constant ever,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>cheerful night and day, establishing the palace in purity and quiet, full of dignity and exceeding grace, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 156</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like a lofty hill rising up in space <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">1</font></a>; or as a white autumn cloud; warm or cool according to the season; choosing a proper dwelling according to the year, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 157</font></span></p>  
 <p>Surrounded by a return of singing women, who join (their voices) in harmonious heavenly concord, without any jarring or unpleasant sound, exciting (in the hearers) forgetfulness of worldly cares. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 158</font></span></p>  
 <p>As the heavenly Gandharvas <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a> of themselves in their beauteous palaces (cause) the singing women to raise heavenly strains, the sounds of which and their beauty ravish both eyes and heart; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 159</font></span></p>  
 <p>(So) Bodhisattva dwelt in his lofty palace, with music such as this. The king his father, for the prince's sake, dwelt purely in his palace, practising every virtue; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 160</font></span></p>  
 <p>Delighting <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the teaching of the true law, he <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">4</font></a> put away from him every evil companion, (that) his heart might not be polluted by lust; regarding inordinate desire as poison, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 161</font></span></p>  
 <p>Keeping his passion and his body in due control, destroying and repressing all trivial thoughts, desiring to enjoy virtuous conversation, loving <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">5</font></a> instruction (fit) to subdue the hearts of men, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 162</font></span></p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>Aiming to accomplish the conversion of unbelievers; removing all schemes of opposition <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a> (from whatever source they came), by the enlightening power of his doctrine, aiming to save the entire world; (thus he desired) that the body of people should obtain rest; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 163</font></span></p>  
 <p>Even as we desire to give peace to our children, so did he long to give rest to the world <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He also attended to his religious duties (sacrificing by fire to all the spirits), with clasped hands adoring the moon (drinking the moon's brightness); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 164</font></span></p>  
 <p>Bathing his body in the waters of the Ganges; cleansing his heart in the waters of religion, performing his duties with no private aim, but regarding his child and the people at large, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 165</font></span></p>  
 <p>Loving righteous conversation <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">3</font></a>, righteous words with loving (aim), loving words with no mixture of falsehood, true words imbued by love, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 166</font></span></p>  
 <p>And yet withal so modest and self-distrustful, unable on that account to speak as confident of truth; loving to all, and yet not loving the world, with no thought of selfishness or covetous desire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 167</font></span></p>  
 <p>Aiming to restrain the tongue and in quietness to find rest from wordy contentions, not seeking in the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>multitude of religious duties to condone for a worldly principle in action <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 168</font></span></p>  
 <p>But aiming to benefit the world, by a liberal and unostentatious charity; the heart without any contentious thought, but resolved by goodness to subdue the contentious, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 169</font></span></p>  
 <p>Composing the one <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whilst protecting the seven, removing the seven, guarding and adjusting the five, reaching to the three, by having learned the three, knowing the two, and removing the two; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 170</font></span></p>  
 <p>Desiring to mortify the passions, and to destroy every enemy of virtue, not multiplying coarse or unseemly words, but exhorting to virtue in the use of courteous language, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 171</font></span></p>  
 <p>Full of sympathy and ready charity, pointing out and practising the way of mutual dependence, receiving and understanding the wisdom of spirits and <i>Ri</i>shis, crushing and destroying every cruel and hateful thought; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 172</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus his fame and virtue were widely renowned, (and yet himself) finally (or, for ever) separate from the ties of the world, showing the ability of a master builder, laying a good foundation of virtue, an example for all the earth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 173</font></span></p>  
 <p>So a man's heart composed and at rest, his limbs and all his members will also be at ease. And now</p>

 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>the son of <i>S</i>uddhodana, and his virtuous wife Ya<i>s</i>odharâ, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 174</font></span></p>  
 <p>As time went on, growing to full estate, their child Râhula was born; and then <i>S</i>uddhodana râ<i>g</i>a considered thus, 'My son, the prince, having a son born to him, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 175</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The affairs of the empire will be handed down in succession, and there will be no end to its righteous government; the prince having begotten a son, will love his son as I love him <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 176</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And no longer think about leaving his home as an ascetic, but devote himself to the practice of virtue; I now have found complete rest of heart, like one just born to heavenly joys.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 177</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like as in the first days of the kalpa, <i>Ri</i>shi-kings by the way in which (they walked), practising pure and spotless deeds, offered up religious offerings, without harm to living thing, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 178</font></span></p>  
 <p>And illustriously prepared an excellent karma, so the king excelling in the excellence of purity <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in family and excellency of wealth, excelling in strength and every exhibition of prowess, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 179</font></span></p>  
 <p>Reflected the glory of his name through the world, as the sun sheds abroad his thousand rays. But now, being the king of men (or, a king among men), he deemed it right to exhibit his son's (prowess), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 180</font></span></p>  
 <p>For the sake of his family and kin, to exhibit him; to increase his family's renown, his glory spread so high as even to obtain the name of 'God begotten;' and having partaken of these heavenly joys, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 181</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>Enjoying the happiness of increased wisdom; understanding the truth, by his own righteousness derived from previous hearing of the truth; the reward of previous acts, widely known <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 182</font></span></p>  
 <p>Would that this might lead my son (he prayed) to love his child and not forsake his home; the kings of all countries, whose sons have not yet grown up, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 183</font></span></p>  
 <p>Have prevented them exercising authority in the empire, in order to give their minds relaxation, and for this purpose have provided them with worldly indulgences, so that they may perpetuate the royal seed; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 184</font></span></p>  
 <p>So now the king, having begotten a royal son, indulged him in every sort of pleasure; desiring that he might enjoy these worldly delights, and not wish to wander from his home in search of wisdom; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 185</font></span></p>  
 <p>In former times the Bodhisattva kings, although their way (life) has been restrained (severe), have yet enjoyed the pleasures of the world, and when they have begotten a son, then separating themselves from family ties, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 186</font></span></p>  
 <p>Have afterwards entered the solitude of the mountains, to prepare themselves in the way of a silent recluse. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 187</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="fn_89"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_89">20:2</a> Vessels of the seven precious (substances).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_90"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_90">20:3</a> According to occasion in abundance produced. The expression 'tsah' may either refer to variety or number. Thus the <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a> convocation of the Arhats at Vai<i>s</i>âlî is called 'tsah;' a miscellaneous collection of anecdotes or tales is called by the same name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_91"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_91">21:1</a> Or, every kind of party-colour’d horse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_92"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_92">21:2</a> Like the clouds.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_93"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_93">22:1</a> This seems to mean that those who had not received benefit from the teaching of the four previous Buddhas, that even these were placable and well-disposed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_94">22:2</a> This is a difficult verse, it may be translated literally thus, 'All learned women (or, all the wives of sages) were profoundly grave as the fist man of the kalpa.' Whether it refers to the docility of the otherwise quarrelsome women, or to their gravity and learning, it is not easy to say.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_95"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_95">23:1</a> The description here given of the peace and content prevailing in the world on the birth of Bodhisattva (and his name given to him in consequence) resembles the account of the golden age in classic authors.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_96">23:2</a> Mâyâ is generally stated to have died after seven days from the birth of her child. But here the context seems to require a longer interval, as he was ten days old when taken to the temple. Mâyâ was born in the Trayastri<i>m</i>sas Heaven, or the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods. The legend states that Buddha after his enlightenment proceeded there to convert her.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_97"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_97">24:1</a> His mind resting on its high and excellent purpose; so at least the expression K’ai, domain or precinct, may sometimes be rendered. It means, 'within the limits of its own high excellent (purpose).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_98"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_98">25:1</a> That is, rising from the earth above other hills.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_99">25:2</a> Gandharvas, heavenly musicians; muses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_100"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_100">25:3</a> With nobleness of purpose (gin) loving the transforming power of the true law. That is, leading a religious life.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_101"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_101">25:4</a> That is, as I understand it, the king himself, for his son's sake, devoted himself to piety.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_102">25:5</a> Or, by means of loving instruction subduing men's hearts; or, by love, teaching to subdue men's hearts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_103">26:1</a> Or, every kind of doctrine (magical art) that opposed religion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_104">26:2</a> Or, (he said) like as I desire rest for my child, so &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_105">26:3</a> This and the whole of the context is obscure; the account evidently refers to <i>S</i>uddhodana; the line which I have translated 'loving righteous conversation' may be rendered 'loving conversation (or, converse), opposing a want of truth or righteousness (i),' or, 'loving an absence of all unrighteousness in conversation.' The next line, which is evidently in contrast with the previous one, may be translated, 'Righteous words, opposed to an absence of love.' The next line is, 'Loving words, opposed to that which is not true.' And then follows, 'Truthful words, opposed to that which is not love.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_106">27:1</a> I would rather translate these two lines thus, 'Not regarding so much the assemblies convoked for sacrificing to the gods, as excelling in the merit (happiness) of separation from worldly things;' or the word 'sse' may mean 'sacrifice' itself (as ποιέω in Greek), and then it would be 'excelling in merit without sacrifice.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_107">27:2</a> These four lines are enigmatical. They perhaps have some reference to the teaching of the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, or the number seven may refer to the 'seven passions.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_108">28:1</a> Or, loving his son, and loving me also.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_109">28:2</a> We have here a succession of lines in which there is a play on the word 'excellency' (shing), or 'victorious' (<i>g</i>ina).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="sbe1904.htm#fr_110">29:1</a> These verses are very obscure, and can only be understood by comparison with the Sanskrit.</p>
