 <p>And now the night was in a moment gone, and sight restored to all created things, (when the royal prince) looked thro’ the wood, and saw the abode of Po-ka, the <i>Ri</i>shi; [the hermitage of the Bhârgavides, see Burnouf, Introduction to Ind. Bud. p. 385]; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 418</font></span></p>  
 <p>The purling streams so exquisitely pure and sparkling, and the wild .beasts all unalarmed at man, caused the royal prince's heart to exult. Tired, the horse <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">2</font></a> stopped of his own will, to breathe. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 419</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This, then,' he thought, 'is a good sign and fortunate, and doubtless indicates divine approval <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' And now he saw belonging to the <i>Ri</i>shi, the various vessels <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">4</font></a> used for (asking) charity; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 420</font></span></p>  
 <p>And (other things) arranged by him in order, without the slightest trace of negligence. Dismounting then he stroked his horse's head, and cried, 'You now have borne me (well)!' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 421</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>With loving eyes he looked at <i>K</i>andaka, (eyes) like the pure cool surface of a placid lake (and said), 'Swift-footed! like a horse in pace, yea! swift as any light-winged bird, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 422</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Ever have you followed after me when riding, and deeply have I felt my debt of thanks, but not yet had you been tried in other ways; I only knew you as a man true-hearted, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 423</font></span></p>  
 <p>'My mind now wonders at your active powers of body; these two I now begin to see (are yours); a man may have a heart most true and faithful, but strength of body may not too be his; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 424</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Bodily strength and perfect honesty of heart, I now have proof enough are yours. (To be content) to leave <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">1</font></a> the tinselled world, and with swift foot to follow me, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 425</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Who would do this but for some profit, if without profit to his kin <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who would not shun it? but you, with no private aim, have followed me, not seeking any present recompense; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 426</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As we nourish and bring up a child, to bind together and bring honour to a family; so we also reverence and obey a father, to gain (obedience and attention) from a begotten son; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 427</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In this way all think of their own advantage; but you have come with me disdaining profit; with many words I cannot hold you here, so let me say in brief to you, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 428</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We have now ended our relationship; take, then, my horse and ride back again; for me, during the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>long night past <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that place I sought to reach now I have obtained.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 429</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then taking off his precious neck-chain, he handed it to <i>K</i>andaka, 'Take this,' he said, 'I give it you, let it console you in your sorrow;' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 430</font></span></p>  
 <p>The precious <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">2</font></a> jewel in the tire <font size="-1" color="green">(sic--JBH)</font> that bound his head, bright-shining, lighting up his person, taking off and placing in his extended palm, like the sun which lights up Sumeru, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 431</font></span></p>  
 <p>He said, 'O <i>K</i>andaka! take this gem, and going back to where my father is, take the jewel and lay it reverently <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">3</font></a> before him, to signify my heart's relation to him; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 432</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And then, for me, request the king to stifle every fickle feeling of affection, and. say that I, to escape from birth and age and death, have entered on the wild (forest) <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">4</font></a> of painful discipline, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 433</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not that I may get a heavenly birth, much less because I have no tenderness of heart, or that I</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>  
 <p>cherish any cause of bitterness, but only that I may escape this weight of sorrow; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 434</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The accumulated long-night <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">1</font></a> weight of covetous desire (love), I now desire to ease the load (cause a break), so that it may be overthrown for ever; therefore I seek the way (cause) of ultimate escape; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 435</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If I should obtain emancipation, then shall I never need to put away my kindred <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to leave my home, to sever ties of love. O! grieve not for your son! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 436</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The five desires of sense beget the sorrow <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">3</font></a>; those held by lust themselves induce the sorrow; my very ancestors, victorious kings, thinking (their throne) established and immovable, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 437</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Have handed down to me their kingly wealth; I, thinking only on religion, put it all away; the royal mothers at the end of life their cherished treasures leave for their sons, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 438</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Those sons who covet much such worldly profit; but I rejoice to have acquired religious wealth; if you say that I am young and tender, and that the time for seeking wisdom is not come, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 439</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You ought to know that to seek true religion, there never is a time not fit; impermanence and fickleness <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the hate of death, these ever follow us, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 440</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And therefore I (embrace) the present day, convinced</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>that now is time to seek religion <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">1</font></a>. With such entreaties as the above, you must make matters plain on my behalf; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 441</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But, pray you cause my father not to think longingly after me; let him destroy all recollection of me <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and cut out from his soul the ties of love; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 442</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And you, grieve not <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">3</font></a> because of what I say, but recollect to give the king my message.' <i>K</i>andaka hearing respectfully the words of exhortation, blinded and confused through choking sorrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 443</font></span></p>  
 <p>With hands outstretched did worship; and answering the prince, he spoke, 'The orders that you give me, will, I fear, add grief to grief; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 444</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And sorrow thus increased will deepen, as the elephant who struggles into deeper mire. When the ties of love are rudely snapped, who, that has any heart, would not grieve! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 445</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The golden ore may still by stamping be broken up, how much more the feelings choked with sorrow <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">4</font></a>! the prince has grown up in a palace <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">5</font></a>, with every care bestowed upon his tender person, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 446</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And now he gives his body to the rough and thorny forest; how will he be able to bear a life of privation <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">6</font></a>? When first you ordered me to equip your steed, my mind was indeed sorely troubled, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 447</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>'But the heavenly powers urged me on, causing me to hasten the preparation (of the horse <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a>), but what is the intention that urges the prince, to resolve thus to leave his secure palace? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 448</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The people of Kapilavastu, and all the country afflicted with grief; your father, now an old man, mindful of his son, loving him moreover tenderly <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 449</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Surely this determination to leave your home, this is not according to duty; it is wrong, surely, to disregard father and mother,--we cannot speak of such a thing with propriety! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 450</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Gotamî, too, who has nourished you so long, fed you with milk when a helpless child, such love as hers cannot easily be forgotten; it is impossible surely to turn the back on a benefactor; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 451</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The highly gifted (virtuous) mother of a child, is ever respected by the most distinguished families <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">3</font></a>; to inherit distinction <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">4</font></a> and then to turn round, is not the mark of a distinguished man: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 452</font></span></p>  
 <p>The illustrious child of Ya<i>s</i>odharâ, who has inherited a kingdom, rightly governed, his years now gradually ripening, should not thus go away from and forsake his home; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 453</font></span></p>  
 <p>But though he has gone away from his royal father, and forsaken his family and his kin, forbid it</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>he should still drive me away, let me not depart from the feet of my master; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 454</font></span></p>  
 <p>'My heart is bound to thee, as the heat is (bound up <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">1</font></a>) in the boiling water; I cannot return without thee to my country; to return and leave the prince thus, in the midst of the solitude of the desert <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 455</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Then should I be like Sumantra <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">3</font></a> (Sumantra), who left and forsook Râma; and now if I return alone to the palace, what words can I address to the king? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 456</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How can I reply to the reproaches of all the dwellers in the palace with suitable words? Therefore let the prince rather tell me, how I may truly <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">4</font></a> describe, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 457</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And with what device, the disfigured body, and the merit-seeking condition of the hermit! I am full of fear and alarm, my tongue can utter no words; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 458</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Tell me then what words to speak; but who is there in the empire will believe me? If I say that the moon's rays are scorching, there are men, perhaps, who may believe me; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 459</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But they will not believe that the prince, in his conduct, will act without piety; (for) the prince's heart is sincere and refined, always actuated with pity and love to men. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 460</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To be deeply affected with love, and yet to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p>  
 <p>forsake (the object of love), this surely is opposed to a constant mind. O then, for pity's sake! return to your home, and thus appease my foolish longings.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 461</font></span></p>  
 <p>The prince having listened to <i>K</i>andaka, pitying his grief expressed in so many words, with heart resolved and strong in its determination, spoke thus to him once more, and said: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 462</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Why thus on my account do you feel the pain of separation? you should overcome this sorrowful mood, it is for you to comfort yourself; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 463</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All creatures, each in its way, foolishly arguing that all things are constant, would influence me to-day not to forsake my kin and relatives; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 464</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But when dead and come to be a ghost, how then, let them say, can I be kept? My loving mother when she bore me, with deep affection painfully carried me, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 465</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And then when born she died, not permitted to nourish me. One alive, the other dead, gone by different roads, where now shall she be found? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 466</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Like as in a wilderness on some high tree all the birds living with their mates assemble in the evening and at dawn disperse, so are the separations of the world; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 467</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The floating clouds rise (like) a high mountain, from the four quarters they fill the void, in a moment again they are separated and disappear; so is it with the habitations of men; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 468</font></span></p>  
 <p>'People from the beginning have erred thus, binding themselves in society and by the ties of love, and then, as after a dream, all is dispersed; do not then recount the names of my relatives; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 469</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For like the wood which is produced in spring,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p>gradually grows and brings forth its leaves, which again fall in the autumn-chilly-dews--if the different parts of the same body are thus divided-- 470</p>  
 <p>'How much more men who are united in society! and how shall the ties of relationship escape rending? Cease therefore your grief and expostulation, obey my commands and return home; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 471</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The thought of your return alone will save me, and perhaps after your return I also may come back. The men of Kapilavastu, hearing that my heart is fixed, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 472</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Will dismiss from their minds all thought of me, but you may make known my words, "when I have escaped from the sad ocean of birth and death, then afterwards I will come back again; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 473</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"But I am resolved, if I obtain not my quest, my body shall perish in the mountain wilds."' The white horse hearing the prince, as he uttered these true and earnest words, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 474</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Bent his knee and licked his foot, whilst he sighed deeply and wept. Then the prince with his soft and glossy palm, (fondly) stroking the head of the white, horse, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 475</font></span></p>  
 <p>(Said), 'Do not let sorrow rise (within), I grieve indeed at losing you, my gallant steed <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">1</font></a>--so strong and active, your merit now has gained its end <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 476</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You shall enjoy for long a respite from an evil birth <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">3</font></a>, but for the present take as your reward <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p>these precious jewels and this glittering sword, and with them follow closely after <i>K</i>andaka.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 477</font></span></p>  
 <p>The prince then drawing forth his sword, glancing in the light as the dragon's eye, (cut off) the knot of hair with its jewelled stud <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and forthwith cast it into space; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 478</font></span></p>  
 <p>Ascending upwards to the firmament, it floated there as the wings of the phoenix then all the Devas of the Trayastri<i>m</i>sa <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">2</font></a> heavens seizing the hair, returned with it to their heavenly abodes; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 479</font></span></p>  
 <p>Desiring always to adore the feet (offer religious service), how much rather now possessed of the crowning locks, with unfeigned piety do they increase their adoration, and shall do till the true law has died away. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 480</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the royal prince thought thus, 'My adornments now are gone for ever, there only now remain these silken garments, which are not in keeping with a hermit's life.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 481</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the Deva of the Pure abode, knowing the heart-ponderings of the prince, transformed himself into a hunter's likeness, holding his bow, his arrows in his girdle, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 482</font></span></p>  
 <p>His body girded with a Kashâya <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">3</font></a>-colour’d robe, thus he advanced in front of the prince. The prince</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>considering this garment of his, the colour of the ground, a fitting pure attire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 483</font></span></p>  
 <p>Becoming to the utmost the person of a <i>Ri</i>shi, not fit for <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">1</font></a> a hunter's dress, forthwith called to the hunter, as he stood before him, in accents soft, and thus addressed him: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 484</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That dress of thine belikes me much, as if it were not foul <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and this my dress I'll give thee in exchange, so please thee.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 485</font></span></p>  
 <p>The hunter then addressed the prince, Although I ill can spare (am not unattached to) this garment, which I use as a disguise among the deer, that alluring them within reach I may kill them, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 486</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Notwithstanding, as it so pleases you, I am now willing to bestow it in exchange for yours.' The hunter having received the sumptuous dress, took again his heavenly body. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 487</font></span></p>  
 <p>The prince and <i>K</i>andaka, the coachman, seeing this, thought deeply <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">3</font></a> thus, 'This garment is of no common character, it is not what a worldly man has worn;' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 488</font></span></p>  
 <p>And in (the prince's) heart great joy arose, as he regarded the coat with double reverence, and forthwith giving all the other things <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">4</font></a> to <i>K</i>andaka, he himself was clad in it, of Kashâya colour; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 489</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then like the dark and lowering cloud <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that surrounds the disc of the sun or moon, he for a moment gazed, scanning his steps (way), then entered on the hermit's grot; .490</p>

The distance given by A<i>s</i>vaghosha, viz. three yo<i>g</i>anas, or about twenty miles, is much more probable than the eight hundred lis, given in later accounts as the length of Bodhisattva's journey. Compare Fah-hien p. 92, note 2.</p>

This crest-jewel is figured in various ways in Buddhist art; as a rule it may be taken to indicate 'the highest' (the head), and in this form it is placed on the head of the figures of Buddha (in Ceylon); and is found at Sanchi and Amarâvati as an object of reverence; it symbolises the supreme authority of Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="sbe1908.htm#fr_161">64:3</a> Illustrious families or tribes are strong, or able, to wait upon or respect. There seems to be a play here on two words: first, shing, illustrious or distinguished, alluding to the <i>S</i>âkyas as a race of <i>G</i>inas or conquerors; secondly, neng, able, alluding to the origin of the word <i>S</i>âkya, i.e. able.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="sbe1908.htm#fr_162">64:4</a> To obtain 'distinction;' still referring to the word shing; also in the next lines. Consult also <a href="sbe1904.htm#page_28">p. 28</a>, note 2 supra.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="sbe1908.htm#fr_166">65:4</a> The order of these lines is again inverted, as they are complicated in the original. The word 'hu,' which I have translated 'truly,' may mean 'dumbly,' or, 'unfeelingly.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="sbe1908.htm#fr_174">69:1</a> This may also be translated, 'a suitable colour for one who is the opposite of, i.e. opposed to the occupation of, a hunter.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="sbe1908.htm#fr_175">69:2</a> That is, as if it were pure; there is a play on the expression 'not foul' or 'impure,' meaning that the dress was itself of a dark or impure colour, and that the occupation of the hunter made it more so.</p>
