   <h3 align="center">VARGA 8. THE GENERAL GRIEF OF THE PALACE.</h3>  
 <p><i>K</i>andaka leading back the horse, opening the way for his heart's sorrow, as he went on, lamented and wept: unable to disburthen his soul. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 570</font></span></p>  
 <p>First of all with the royal prince, passing along the road for one night, but now dismissed and ordered</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>to return. As the darkness of night closed on him, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 571</font></span></p>  
 <p>Irresolute he wavered in mind. On the eighth day approaching the city, the noble horse pressed onwards, exhibiting all his qualities of speed; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 572</font></span></p>  
 <p>But yet hesitating as he looked around and beheld not the form of the royal prince; his four members bent down with toil, his head and neck deprived of their glossy look, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 573</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whinnying as he went on with grief, he refused night and day his grass and water, because he had lost his lord, the deliverer of men. Returning thus to Kapilavastu, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 574</font></span></p>  
 <p>The whole country appeared withered and bare, as when one comes back to a deserted village; or as when the sun hidden behind Sumeru causes darkness to spread over the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 575</font></span></p>  
 <p>The fountains of water sparkled no more, the flowers and fruits were withered and dead, the men and women in the streets seemed lost in grief and dismay. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 576</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus <i>K</i>andaka with the white horse went on sadly and with slow advance, silent to those enquiring, wearily progressing as when accompanying a funeral; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 577</font></span></p>  
 <p>So they went on, whilst all the spectators seeing <i>K</i>andaka, but not observing the royal <i>S</i>âkya prince, raised piteous cries of lamentation and wept; as when the charioteer returned without Râma. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 578</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then one by the side of the road, with his body bent, called out to <i>K</i>andaka: 'The prince, beloved of the world, the defender of his people, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 579</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The one you have taken away by stealth, where</p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p>dwells he now?' <i>K</i>andaka, then, with sorrowful heart, replied to the people and said: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 580</font></span></p>  
 <p>'I with loving purpose followed after him whom I loved; ’tis not I who have deserted the prince, but by him have I been sent away; (by him) who now has given up his ordinary adornments, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 581</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And with shaven head and religious garb, has entered the sorrow-giving grove.' Then the men hearing that he had become an ascetic, were oppressed with thoughts of wondrous boding (unusual thoughts); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 582</font></span></p>  
 <p>They sighed with heaviness and wept, and as their tears coursed down their cheeks, they spake thus one to the other: 'What then shall we do (by way of expedient)?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 583</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then they all exclaimed at once, 'Let us haste after him in pursuit; for as when a man's bodily functions fail, his frame dies and his spirit flees, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 584</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So is the prince our life, and he our life gone, how shall we survive? This city, perfected with slopes and woods; those woods, that cover the slopes of the city, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 585</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All deprived of grace, ye lie as Bharata when killed!' Then the men and women within the town, vainly supposing the prince had come back, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 586</font></span></p>  
 <p>In haste rushed out to the heads of the way, and seeing the horse returning alone, not knowing whether he (the prince) was safe or lost, began to weep and to raise every piteous sound; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 587</font></span></p>  
 <p>(And said, 'Behold!) <i>K</i>andaka advancing slowly with the horse, comes back with sighs and tears; surely he grieves because the prince is lost.' And thus sorrow is added to sorrow! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 588</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then like a captive warrior is drawn before the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>king his master, so did he enter the gates with tears, his eyes filled so that he said nought. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 589</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then looking up to heaven he loudly groaned; and the white horse too whined piteously; then all the varied birds and beasts in the palace court, and all the horses within the stables, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 590</font></span></p>  
 <p>Hearing the sad whinnying of the royal steed, replied in answer to him, thinking 'now the prince has come back.' But seeing him not, they ceased their cries! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 591</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the women of the after-palace, (hearing the cries of the horses, birds, and beasts,) their hair dishevelled, their faces wan and yellow, their forms sickly to look at, their mouths and lips parched, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 592</font></span></p>  
 <p>Their garments torn and unwashed, the soil and heat not cleansed from their bodies, their ornaments all thrown aside, disconsolate and sad, cheerless in face, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 593</font></span></p>  
 <p>Raised their bodies, without any grace, even as the feeble (little) morning star (or stars of morning); their garments torn and knotted, soiled like the appearance of a robber, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 594</font></span></p>  
 <p>Seeing <i>K</i>andaka and the royal horse shedding tears instead of the hoped-for return, they all, assembled thus, uttered their cry, even as those who weep for one beloved just dead; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 595</font></span></p>  
 <p>Confused and wildly they rushed about, as a herd of oxen that have lost their way. Mahâpra<i>g</i>âpati Gôtamî, hearing that the prince had not returned, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 596</font></span></p>  
 <p>Fell fainting on the ground, her limbs entirely deprived of strength, even as some mad tornado wind crushes the golden-colour’d plantain tree; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 597</font></span></p>  
 <p>And again, hearing that her son had become a recluse, deeply sighing and with increased sadness</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>she thought, 'Alas! those glossy locks turning to the right, each hair produced from each orifice, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 598</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Dark and pure, gracefully shining, sweeping the earth when loose <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or when so determined, bound together in a heavenly crown, and now shorn and lying in the grass! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 599</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Those rounded shoulders and that lion step! Those eyes broad as the ox-king's, that body shining bright as yellow gold; that square breast and Brahma voice; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 600</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That you! possessing all these excellent qualities, should have entered on the sorrow-giving forest; what fortune now remains for the world, losing thus the holy king of earth? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 601</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That those delicate and pliant feet, pure as the lily and of the same colour, should now be torn by stones and thorns; O how can such feet tread on such ground! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 602</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Born and nourished in the guarded palace, clad with garments of the finest texture, washed in richly-scented water, anointed with the choicest perfumes, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 603</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And now exposed to chilling blasts and dews of night, O! where during the heat or the chilly morn can rest be found! Thou flower of all thy race! Confessed by all the most renowned! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 604</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thy virtuous qualities everywhere talked of and exalted, ever reverenced, without self-seeking! why hast thou unexpectedly brought thyself upon some morn to beg thy food for life! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 605</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thou who wert wont to repose upon a soft and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>kingly couch, and indulge in every pleasure during thy waking hours, how canst thou now endure the mountain and the forest wilds, on the bare grass to make thyself a resting-place!' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 606</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus thinking of her son--her heart was full of sorrow, disconsolate she lay upon the earth. The waiting women raised her up, and dried the tears from off her face, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 607</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst all the other courtly ladies, overpowered with grief, their limbs relaxed, their minds bound fast with woe, unmoved they sat like pictured-folk. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 608</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now Ya<i>s</i>odharâ deeply chiding, spoke thus to <i>K</i>andaka: 'Where now dwells he, who ever dwells within my mind? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 609</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You two went forth, the horse a third, but now two only have returned! My heart is utterly o’er-borne with grief, filled with anxious thoughts, it cannot rest. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 610</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And you deceitful man! Untrustworthy and false associate! evil contriver! plainly revealed a traitor, a smile lurks underneath thy tears! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 611</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Escorting him in going; returning now with wails! Not one at heart--but in league against him--openly constituted a friend and well-wisher, concealing underneath a treacherous purpose; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 612</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So thou hast caused the sacred prince to go forth once and not return again! No questioning the joy you feel! Having done ill you now enjoy the fruit; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 613</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Better far to dwell with an enemy of wisdom, than work with one who, while a fool, professes friendship. Openly professing sweetness and light, inwardly a scheming and destructive enemy. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 614</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And now this royal and kingly house, in one short morn is crushed and ruined! All these fair and queen-like women, with grief o’erwhelmed, their beauty marred, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 615</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Their breathing choked with tears and sobs, their faces soiled with crossing tracks of grief! Even the queen (Mâyâ) when in life, resting herself on him, as the great snowy mountains <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 616</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Repose upon the widening earth, through grief in thought of What would happen, died. How sad the lot of these--within these open lattices--these weeping ones, these deeply wailing! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 617</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Born in another state than hers in heaven <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">1</font></a>, how can their grief be borne!' Then speaking to the horse she said, 'Thou unjust! what dullness this--to carry off a man, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 618</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As in the darkness some wicked thief bears off a precious gem. When riding thee in time of battle, swords, and javelins and arrows, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 619</font></span></p>  
 <p>'None of these alarmed or frighted thee! But now what fitfulness of temper this <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to carry off by violence, to rob my soul of one, the choicest jewel of his tribe. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 620</font></span></p>  
 <p>'O! thou art but a vicious reptile, to do such wickedness as this! to-day thy woeful lamentation sounds everywhere within these palace walls, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 621</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But when you stole away my cherished one, why wert thou dumb and silent then! if then thy voice</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>had sounded loud, and roused the palace inmates from their sleep, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 622</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If then they had awoke and slumbered not, there would not have ensued the present sorrow.' <i>K</i>andaka, hearing these sorrowful words, drawing in his breath and composing himself, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 623</font></span></p>  
 <p>Wiping away his tears, with hands clasped together, answered: 'Listen to me, I pray, in self-justification--be not suspicious of, nor blame the royal <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">1</font></a> horse, nor be thou angry with me either. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 624</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For in truth, no fault has been committed (by us). It is the gods who have effected this. For I, indeed, extremely reverenced the king's command, it was the gods who drove him to the solitudes, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 625</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Urgently leading on the horse with him: thus they went together fleet as with wings, his breathing hushed! suppressed was every sound <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">2</font></a>, his feet scarce touched the earth! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 626</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The city gates wide opening of themselves! all space self-lighted! this was the work indeed of the gods; and what was I, or what my strength, compared with theirs?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 627</font></span></p>  
 <p>Ya<i>s</i>odharâ hearing these words, her heart was lost in deep consideration <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">3</font></a>! the deeds accomplished by the gods could not be laid to others' charge <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as faults; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 628</font></span></p>  
 <p>And so she ceased her angry chiding, and allowed her great, consuming grief to smoulder. Thus prostrate on the ground she muttered out her sad complaints,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'That the two ringed-birds <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">1</font></a> (doves) should be divided! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 629</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now,' she cried, 'my stay and my support is lost, between those once agreed in life (religious life) <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">2</font></a>, separation has sprung up! those who were at one (as to religion) are now divided, (let go their common action)! where shall I seek another mode of (religious) life? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 630</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In olden days the former conquerors (<i>G</i>inas?) greatly rejoiced to see their kingly retinue; these with their wives in company, in search of highest wisdom, roamed through groves and plains. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 631</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And now, that he should have deserted me! and what is the religious state he seeks! the Brahman ritual respecting sacrifice, requires the wife to take part in the offering <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 632</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And because they both share in the service they shall both receive a common reward hereafter! but you (O prince!) art niggard in your religious rites, driving me away, and wandering forth alone! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 633</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Is it that you saw me jealous, and so turned against me! that you now seek some one free from</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>jealousy! or did you see some other cause to hate me, that you now seek to find a heaven-born nymph <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">1</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 634</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But why should one excelling in every personal grace seek to practise self-denying austerities! is it that you despise a common lot with me, that variance rises in your breast against your wife! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 635</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Why does not Rahula fondly repose upon <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">2</font></a> your knee. Alas! alas! unlucky master! full of grace without, but hard (diamond) at heart! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 636</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The glory and the pride of all your tribe <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">3</font></a>, yet hating those who reverence you! O! can it be, you have turned your back for good (upon) your little child, scarce able yet to smile <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">4</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 637</font></span></p>  
 <p>'My heart is gone! and all my strength! my lord has fled, to wander in the mountains! he cannot surely thus forget me! he is then but a man of wood or stone.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 638</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus having spoken, her mind was dulled and darkened, she muttered on, or spoke in wild mad words, or fancied that she saw strange sights, and sobbing past the power of self-restraint, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 639</font></span></p>  
 <p>Her breath grew less, and sinking thus, she fell asleep upon the dusty ground! The palace ladies seeing this, were wrung with heartfelt sorrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 640</font></span></p>  
 <p>Just as the full-blown lily, struck by the wind and hail, is broken down and withered. And now the</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>king, his father, having lost the prince, was filled, both night and day, with grief; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 641</font></span></p>  
 <p>And fasting, sought the gods (for help). He prayed that they would soon restore him, and having prayed and finished sacrifice, he went from out the sacred <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">1</font></a> gates; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 642</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then hearing all the cries and sounds of mourning, his mind distressed became confused, as when heaven's thundering and lightning put to bewildering flight a herd of elephants. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 643</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then seeing <i>K</i>andaka with the royal steed, after long questioning, finding his son a hermit, fainting he fell upon the earth, as when the flag of Indra falls and breaks. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 644</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then all the ministers of state, upraising him, exhort him, as was right <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to calm himself. After a while, his mind somewhat recovered, speaking to the royal steed, he said: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 645</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How often have I ridden thee to battle, and every time have thought upon (commended) your excellence! but now I hate and loathe thee, more than ever I have loved or praised thee! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 646</font></span></p>  
 <p>'My son, renowned for noble qualities, thou hast carried off and taken from me; and left him 'mid the mountain forests; and now you have come back alone <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 647</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Take me, then, quickly hence and go! And going, never more come back with me! For since you have not brought him back, my life is worth no more preserving; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 648</font></span></p>  
 <p>'No longer care I about governing! My son about</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>me was my only joy; as the Brahman <i>G</i>ayanta <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">1</font></a> met death for his son's sake, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 649</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So I, deprived of my religious son, will of myself deprive myself of life. So Manu, lord of all that lives, ever lamented for his son; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 650</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How much more I, a mortal man (ever-man), deprived of mine, must lose all rest! In old time the king A<i>g</i>a, loving his son <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">2</font></a>, wandering thro’ the mountains, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 651</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Lost in thought (or deeply affected), ended life, and forthwith was born in heaven. And now I cannot die! Thro’ the long night fixed in this sad state, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 652</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With this great palace round me, thinking of my son, solitary and athirst as any hungry spirit (Preta); as one who, thirsty, holding water in his hand, but when he tries to drink lets all escape, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 653</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And so remains athirst till death ensues, and after death becomes a wandering ghost <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">3</font></a>;--so I, in the extremity of thirst, through loss, possessed once of a son <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">4</font></a>, but now without a son, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 654</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Still live, and cannot end my days! But come! tell me at once where is my son! let me not die athirst (for want of knowing this) and fall among the Pretas. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 655</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In former days, at least, my will was strong and firm, difficult to move as the great earth; but now I've lost my son, my mind is dazed, as in old time the king "ten chariots <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">5</font></a>."' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 656</font></span></p>

 <p>'We will break down his resolution, and thus assuage your kingly sorrow.' The king, with joy, replied and said: 'Would that you both would go in haste, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 662</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As swiftly as the Saketa <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">4</font></a> bird flies through the void for her young's sake; thinking of nought but the royal prince, and sad at heart--I shall await your search!' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 663</font></span></p>
