   <h3 align="center">VARGA 28. DIVISION OF THE <i>S</i>ARÎRAS.</h3>  
 <p>Thus those Mallas offered religious reverence to the relics, and used the most costly flowers and scents for their supreme act of worship. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2218</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the kings of the seven countries <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">3</font></a>, having heard that Buddha was dead, sent messengers to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Mallas asking to share the sacred relics (of Buddha). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2219</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the Mallas reverencing the body of Tathâgata, trusting to their martial renown, conceived a haughty mind: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2220</font></span></p>  
 <p>'They would rather part with life itself (they said), than with the relics of the Buddha;' so those messengers returned from the futile embassage. Then the seven kings, highly indignant, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2221</font></span></p>  
 <p>With an army, numerous as the rain. clouds, advanced on Ku<i>s</i>inagara; the people who went from the city filled with terror soon returned <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2222</font></span></p>  
 <p>And told the Mallas all, that the soldiers and the cavalry of the neighbouring countries were coming, with elephants and chariots, to surround the Ku<i>s</i>inagara city. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2223</font></span></p>  
 <p>The gardens, lying without the town, the fountains, lakes, flower and fruit trees were now destroyed by the advancing host, and all the pleasant resting-places lay in ruins. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2224</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Mallas, mounting on the city towers, beheld the great supports of life <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">1</font></a> destroyed; they then prepared their warlike engines to crush the foe without; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2225</font></span></p>  
 <p>Balistas <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">2</font></a> and catapults and 'flying torches <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">3</font></a>' to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a></p>  
 <p>hurl against the advancing host. Then the seven kings entrenched themselves around the city, each army host filled with increasing courage; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2226</font></span></p>  
 <p>Their wings of battle shining in array as the sun's seven beams of glory shine; the heavy drums <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">1</font></a> rolling as the thunder, the warlike breath (rising) as the full cloud mist. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2227</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Mallas, greatly incensed, opening the gates command the fray to begin; the aged men and women whose hearts had trust in Buddha's law, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2228</font></span></p>  
 <p>With deep concern breathed forth their vow, 'Oh! may the victory be a bloodless one <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' Those who had friends used mutual exhortations not to encourage in themselves a desire for strife. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2229</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the warriors, clad in armour, grasping their spears and brandishing their swords ’midst the confused noise and heavy drums <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">1</font></a> (advanced). But ere the contest had begun, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2230</font></span></p>  
 <p>There was a certain Brahman whose name was Dro<i>n</i>a (tuh-lau-na), celebrated for penetration, honour'd for modesty and lowliness, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2231</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whose loving heart took pleasure in religion. This one addressed those kings and said: 'Regarding the unequalled strength of yonder city, one man alone would be enough (for its defence); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2232</font></span></p>  
 <p>How much less when with determined heart (they are united), In the beginning <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">3</font></a> mutual strife produced destruction, how now can it result in glory or renown? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2233</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>'The clash of swords and bloody onset done, ’tis certain one must perish! and therefore whilst you aim to vanquish those, both sides will suffer in the fray. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2234</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Then there are many chances, too, of battle, ’tis hard to measure strength by appearances; the strong, indeed, may overcome the weak, the weak may also overcome the strong; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2235</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The powerful champion may despise the snake, but how will he escape a wounded body? there are men whose natures bland and soft, seem suited for the company of women or of children, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2236</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But when enlisted in the ranks, make perfect soldiers. As fire when it is fed with oil, though reckoned weak, is not extinguished easily; so when you say that they (your enemies) are weak, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2237</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Beware of leaning overmuch on strength of body; nought can compare with strength of right (religion). There was in ancient times a <i>G</i>ina <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">1</font></a> king, whose name was Kârandhama (Avikshit), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2238</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His graceful (upright) presence caused such love (in others) that he could overcome all animosity; but though he ruled the world and was high renowned, and rich and prosperous, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2239</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Yet in the end he went back <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">2</font></a> and all was lost! So when the ox has drunk enough, he too returns. Use then the principles of righteousness, use the expedients of good will and love. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2240</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Conquer your foe by force, you increase his</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>  
 <p>enmity; conquer by love, and you will reap no after-sorrow. The present strife is but a thirst for blood, this thing cannot be endured! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2241</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If you desire to honour Buddha, follow the example of his patience and long-suffering <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' Thus this Brahman with confidence declared the truth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2242</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Imbued with highest principles of peace, he spake with boldness and unflinchingly. And now the kings addressed the Brahman thus: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2243</font></span></p>  
 <p>'You have chosen a fitting time for giving increase to the seed of wisdom, the essence of true friendship is (leads to) the utterance of truth. The greatest force (of reason) lies in righteous judgment. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2244</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But now in turn hear what we say: The rules of kings are framed to avoid the use of force when hatred has arisen from low desires (question of the five pleasures); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2245</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Or else to avoid the sudden use of violence in trifling questions (where some trifling matter is at stake). But we for the sake of law (religion) are about to fight. What wonder is it! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2246</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Swollen pride is a principle to be opposed, for it leads to the overthrow of society; no wonder then that Buddha preached against it, teaching men to practise lowliness and humility. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2247</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Then why should we be forbidden to pay our reverence to his body-relics? In ancient days a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>lord of the great earth, Pih-shih-tsung <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">1</font></a> Nanda [or two lords, viz. Pih-shih-tsung and Nanda], <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2248</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For the sake of a beautiful woman fought and destroyed each other; how much more now, for the sake of religious reverence to our master, freed from passion, gone to Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2249</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Without regard to self, or careful of our lives, should we contend and assert our rights! A former king Kaurava (or belonging to the Kauravas) fought with a Pâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ava (king), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2250</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And the more they increased in strength the more they struggled, all for some temporary gain; how much more for our not-coveting <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">2</font></a> master (should we contend), coveting to get his living (relics)? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2251</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The son of Râma, too, the <i>Ri</i>shi (or Râma<i>ri</i>shiputra), angry with king Da<i>s</i>aratha, destroyed his country, slew the people, because of the rage he felt; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2252</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How much less for our master, freed from anger, should we be niggard of our lives! Râma, for Sîta's sake, killed all the demon-spirits; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2253</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How much more for our lord, heaven <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">3</font></a>-received, should we not sacrifice our lives! The two demons A-lai (Alaka) and Po-ku were ever drawn into contention; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2254</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In the first place, because of their folly and ignorance, causing wide ruin among men; how</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>much less for our all-wise master should we begrudge our lives! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2255</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Wherefore if from these examples we find others ready to die for no real principle, how shall we for our teacher of gods (Devas) and men, reverenced by the universe, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2256</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Spare our bodies or begrudge our lives, and not be earnest in desire to make our offerings! Now then, if you desire to stay the strife, go, and for us demand within the city <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2257</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That they open wide (distribute) the relics, and so cause our prayer to be fulfilled. But because your words are right ones, we hold our anger for a while; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2258</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Even as the great, angry snake, by the power of charms is quieted.' And now the Brahman <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">1</font></a>, having received the king's instruction, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2259</font></span></p>  
 <p>Entering the city, went to the Mallas, and saluting them, spoke these true words: 'Without the city those who are kings among men <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">2</font></a> grasp with their hands their martial weapons, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2260</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And with their bodies clad in weighty armour wait eagerly (to fight); glorious as the sun's rays; bristling with rage as the roused lion. These united are, to overthrow this city. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2261</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But whilst they wage this religious war, they fear lest they may act irreligiously, and so they have sent me here to say what they require. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2262</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"We <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">3</font></a> have come, not for the sake of territory,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>much less for money's sake, nor on account of any insolent feeling, nor yet from any thought of hatred; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2263</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"But because we venerate the great <i>Ri</i>shi, we have come on this account. You, noble sirs! know well our mind! Why should there be such sorrowful contention! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2264</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"You honour what we honour, both alike, then we are brothers as concerns religion. We both with equal heart revere the bequeathed spiritual relics of the lord. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2265</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"To be miserly in (hoarding) wealth, this is an unreasonable fault; how much more to grudge religion, of which there is so little knowledge in the world! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2266</font></span></p>  
 <p>'"The exclusive and the selfishly-inclined, should practise laws of hospitality (civility) <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but if ye have not rules of honour <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">2</font></a> such as these, then shut your gates and guard yourselves." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2267</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This is the tenor of the words, be they good or bad, spoken by them. But now for myself and my own feelings, let me add these true and sincere words. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2268</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Let there be no contention either way; reason ought to minister for peace, the lord when dwelling in the world ever employed the force of patience. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2269</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not to obey his holy teaching, and yet to offer gifts to him, is contradiction. Men of the world</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>for some indulgence, some wealth or land, contend and fight, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2270</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But those who believe the righteous law, should obediently conform their lives to it; to believe and yet to harbour enmity, this is to oppose "religious principle" to "conduct." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2271</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Buddha himself at rest, and full of love, desired to bestow the rest he enjoyed, on all. To adore with worship the great merciful, and yet to gender wide destruction, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2272</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(How is this possible?) Divide the relics, then, that all may worship them alike; obeying thus the law, the fame thereof wide-spread, then righteous principles will be diffused; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2273</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if others walk not righteously, we ought by righteous dealing to appease them, in this way showing the advantage (pleasure) of religion, we cause religion everywhere to take deep hold and abide. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2274</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Buddha has told us that of all charity "religious charity" is the highest; men easily bestow their wealth in charity, but hard is the charity that works for righteousness.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2275</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Mallas hearing the Brahman's words with inward shame gazed at one another; and answered the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin thus: 'We thank you much for purposing to come to us, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2276</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And for your friendly and religious counsel--speaking so well, and reasonably. Yours are words which a Brahman ought to use, in keeping with his holy character <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2277</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Words full of reconciliation, pointing out the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>proper road; like one recovering a wandering horse brings him back by the path which he had lost. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2278</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We then ought to adopt the plan of reconciliation such as you have shown us; to hear the truth and not obey it brings afterwards regretful sorrow.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2279</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then they opened out the master's relics and in eight parts equally divided them. Themselves paid reverence to one part, the other seven they handed to the Brahman; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2280</font></span></p>  
 <p>The seven kings having accepted these, rejoiced and placed them on their heads <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and thus with them returned to their own country, and erected Dâgobas for worship over them. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2281</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Brahma<i>k</i>ârin then besought the Mallas to bestow on him the relic-pitcher as his portion, and from the seven kings he requested a fragment of their relics, as an eighth share. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2282</font></span></p>  
 <p>Taking this, he returned and raised a <i>K</i>aitya, which still is named 'the Golden Pitcher Dâgoba.' Then the men of Ku<i>s</i>inagara collecting all the ashes of the burning, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2283</font></span></p>  
 <p>Raised over them a <i>K</i>aitya, and called it 'the Ashes Dâgoba.' The eight Stûpas of the eight kings, 'the Golden Pitcher' and 'the Ashes Stûpa <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2284</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus throughout <i>G</i>ambudvîpa there first were raised ten Dâgobas. Then all the lords and ladies</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the country holding gem-embroidered canopies, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2285</font></span></p>  
 <p>Paid their offerings at the various shrines, adorning them as any golden mountain <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And so with music and with dancing through the day and night they made merry, and sang. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2286</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the Arhats numbering five hundred, having for ever lost their master's presence, reflecting there was now no ground of certainty, returned to G<i>ri</i>dhrakû<i>t</i>a mount; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2287</font></span></p>  
 <p>Assembling in king <i>S</i>akra's cavern <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they collected there the Sûtra Pi<i>t</i>aka; all the assembly agreeing that the venerable Ânanda <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2288</font></span></p>  
 <p>Should say (recite), for the sake of the congregation, the sermons of Tathâgata from first to last, 'Great and small, whatever you have heard from the mouth of the deceased Muni.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2289</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then Amanda in the great assembly ascending the lion throne, declared in order what the lord had preached, uttering the words 'Thus have I heard.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2290</font></span></p>  
 <p>The whole assembly, bathed in tears, were deeply moved as he pronounced the words 'I heard;' and so he announced the law as to the time, as to the place, as to the person; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2291</font></span></p>  
 <p>As he spoke, so was it written down from first to last, the complete Sûtra Pi<i>t</i>aka <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">3</font></a>. By diligent</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a></p>  
 <p>attention in the use of means, practising (the way of) wisdom, (all these) (Arhats) obtained Nirvâ<i>n</i>a; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2292</font></span></p>  
 <p>Those now able so to do, or hereafter able, shall attain Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, in the same way. King A<i>s</i>oka <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">1</font></a> born in the world when strong, caused much sorrow; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2293</font></span></p>  
 <p>When feeble <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">2</font></a>, then he banished sorrow; as the A<i>s</i>oka-flower tree, ruling over <i>G</i>ambudvîpa, his heart for ever put an end to sorrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2294</font></span></p>  
 <p>When brought to entire faith in the true law; therefore he was called 'the King who frees from sorrow.' A descendant of the Mayûra family, receiving from heaven a righteous disposition, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2295</font></span></p>  
 <p>He ruled equally over the world; he raised everywhere towers and shrines, his private name the 'violent A<i>s</i>oka,' now called the 'righteous A<i>s</i>oka.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2296</font></span></p>  
 <p>Opening the Dâgobas raised by those seven kings to take the <i>S</i>arîras thence, he spread them everywhere, and raised in one day eighty-four thousand towers <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2297</font></span></p>  
 <p>Only with regard to the eighth pagoda in Râmagrama, which the Nâga spirit protected <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the king was unable to obtain those relics; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2298</font></span></p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a></p>  
 <p>But though he obtained them not, knowing they were spiritually bequeathed relics of Buddha which the Nâga worshipped and adored, his faith was in creased and his reverent disposition. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2299</font></span></p>  
 <p>Although the king was ruler of the world, yet was he able to obtain the first holy fruit <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and thus induced the entire empire to honour and revere the shrines of Tathâgata. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2300</font></span></p>  
 <p>In the past and present, thus there has been deliverance for all. Tathâgata, when in the world; and now his relics--after his Nirvâ<i>n</i>a; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2301</font></span></p>  
 <p>Those who worship and revere these, gain equal merit; so also those who raise themselves by wisdom, and reverence the virtues of the Tathâgata, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2302</font></span></p>  
 <p>Cherishing religion, fostering a spirit of alms-giving, they gain great merit also. The noble and superlative law of Buddha ought to receive the adoration of the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2303</font></span></p>  
 <p>Gone to that undying place (Amrita), those who believe (his law) shall follow him there; therefore let all the Devas and men, without exception, worship and adore <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2304</font></span></p>  
 <p>The one great loving and compassionate, who mastered thoroughly the highest truth, in order to deliver all that lives. Who that hears of him, but yearns with love! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2305</font></span></p>  
 <p>The pains of birth, old age, disease, and death, the endless sorrows of the world, the countless miseries of 'hereafter,' dreaded by all the Devas, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2306</font></span></p>  
 <p>He has removed all these accumulated sorrows;</p>  
 <p>

 <p>say, who would not revere him? to escape the joys of after life, this is the world's chief joy! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2307</font></span></p>  
 <p>To add the pain of other births, this is the world's worst sorrow! Buddha, escaped from pain of birth, shall have no joy of the 'hereafter <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2308</font></span></p>  
 <p>And having shown the way to all the world, who would not reverence and adore him? To sing the praises of the lordly monk, and (declare) his acts from first to last, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2309</font></span></p>  
 <p>Without self-seeking or self-honour, without desire for personal renown, but following what the scriptures say, to benefit the world, (has been my aim.) <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2310</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="fn_889"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_890">326:2</a> It may be rendered 'bow catapults' and 'balista-stone-carriages,' or bows, catapults, balistas, and stone carriages (carrying machines?).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_890"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_891">326:3</a> These flying torches and other instruments were used by the Northern nations from remote antiquity. There is no indication of them, however, in the plate (xxxviii) in Tree and Serpent Worship, which, I take it, represents this scene. A<i>s</i>vaghosha was familiar with Kanishka and his military appliances, and these doubtless included the instruments here referred to.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_895"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_897">328:2</a> Whether it means he went back 'to death,' or he lost his possessions by warfare, is not plain from the text. The phrase 'all was lost,' may also be rendered, 'he gave up all.'</p>

 <p>But it is not plain how Dro<i>n</i>a could address the Mallas as 'reverend sirs,' unless indeed the brethren were going to fight, which is beyond probability.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_902"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_904">331:3</a> This is the only way to take the translation, although the pronoun ’ngo standing alone would signify 'I' have come; but <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a> perhaps the singular implies that Dro<i>n</i>a used the words of the chief of the kings.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_906"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_908">334:1</a> Placing relics on the head was a token of reverence. Compare plate xxxviii (Tree and Serpent Worship).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_907"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_909">334:2</a> In reference to these <i>K</i>aityas or towers, compare the account given in the Pâli (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 135), and also Fă-hien, cap. xxiii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_908"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_910">335:1</a> Or, as the Golden Mountain, i.e. Sumeru.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_910"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_912">335:3</a> Here we have a short account of the first Buddhist Council, called the Council of the 500. It forms no part of the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, although it is found in the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka. Compare Oldenberg, Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>akam, Introduction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_911"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_913">336:1</a> This episode about A<i>s</i>oka is a curious one. It would seem from it that A<i>s</i>vaghosha knew only of one king of that name, called first 'the fierce,' afterwards 'the righteous.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_912"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_914">336:2</a> There are one or two Avadânas to be met with in Chinese Buddhist literature, relating to A<i>s</i>oka's sickness, and how he then desired to redeem his character by making offerings to Buddha. But the accounts are too uncertain to be admitted as conclusive evidence in the question of his conversion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_913"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_915">336:3</a> This is a story everywhere received in Northern books. These eighty-four thousand towers are supposed to represent the number of sections, or perhaps letters, in the Pi<i>t</i>akas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_914"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_916">336:4</a> See Fă-hien's account, cap. xxiii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_915"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_917">337:1</a> 'That is, the first step in the Buddhist profession of sanctity (Srotâpanna).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_916"></a><a href="sbe1930.htm#fr_918">338:1</a> The joy of the 'hereafter,' is the joy, as men count it, of future sentient happiness. This, according to the text, it is the happiness of Buddha to have escaped.</p>
