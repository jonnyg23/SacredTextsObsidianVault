   <h3 align="center">VARGA 13. DEFEATS MÂRA.</h3>  
 <p>The great <i>Ri</i>shi, of the royal tribe of <i>Ri</i>shis, beneath the Bodhi tree firmly established, resolved by oath to perfect the way of complete deliverance. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1036</font></span></p>  
 <p>The spirits, Nâgas, and the heavenly multitude <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">1</font></a>, all were filled with joy; but Mâra Devarâ<i>g</i>a, enemy of religion, alone was grieved, and rejoiced not; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1037</font></span></p>  
 <p>Lord of the five desires <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">2</font></a>, skilled in all the arts of warfare, the foe of those who seek deliverance, therefore his name is rightly given Pi<i>s</i>una <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1038</font></span></p>  
 <p>Now this Mâra râ<i>g</i>a had three daughters, mincingly beautiful and of a pleasant countenance, in every way fit by artful ways to enflame a man with love, highest in this respect among the Devîs. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1039</font></span></p>  
 <p>The first was named Yuh-yen (lust-pollution), the second Neng-yueh-<i>g</i>in (able to delight a man),</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>the third Ngai-loh <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">1</font></a> (love joy). These three, at this time, advanced together, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1040</font></span></p>  
 <p>And addressed their father Pi<i>s</i>una and said: 'May we not know the trouble that afflicts you?' The father calming his feelings, addressed his daughters thus: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1041</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The world has now a great Muni, he has taken a strong oath as a helmet, he holds a mighty bow in his hand, wisdom is the diamond shaft he uses, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1042</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His object is to get the mastery in the world, to ruin and destroy my territory (domain); I am myself unequal to him, for all men will believe in him, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1043</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And all find refuge in the way of his salvation; then will my land be desert and unoccupied. But as when a man transgresses the laws of morality, his body (or, he himself) is then empty (i.e. unprotected), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1044</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So now, the eye of wisdom, not yet opened (in this man), whilst my empire still has peace (quiet), I will go and overturn his purpose, and break down and divide the ridge-pole (of his house) <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1045</font></span></p>  
 <p>Seizing then his bow and his five arrows, with all his retinue of male and female attendants, he went to that grove of 'fortunate rest' with the vow that the world (all flesh) should not find peace <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1046</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then seeing the Muni, quiet and still (silent), preparing to cross the sea of the three worlds, in his left hand grasping his bow, with his right hand pointing his arrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1047</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>He addressed Bodhisattva and said: 'Kshatriya! rise up quickly! for you may well fear! your death is at hand; you may practise your own religious system <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1048</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But let go this effort after the law of deliverance (for others); wage warfare in the field of charity <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">2</font></a> as a cause of merit, appease the tumultuous world, and so in the end reach your reward in heaven; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1049</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This is a way renowned and well established, in which former saints (victors) have walked, <i>Ri</i>shis and kings and men of eminence; but this system of penury and alms-begging is unworthy of you. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1050</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now then if you rise not, you had best consider with yourself, that if you give not up your vow, and tempt me to let fly an <a href="errata.htm#1">arrow</a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1051</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How that Aila, grandchild of Soma <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">3</font></a>, by one of these arrows just touched, as by a fanning of the wind, lost his reason and became a madman; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1052</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And how the <i>Ri</i>shi Vimala, practising austerities, hearing the sound of one of these darts, his heart possessed by great fear, bewildered and darkened he lost his true nature; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1053</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How much less can you--a late-born one--hope to escape this dart of mine. Quickly arise then! if hardly you may get away! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1054</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This arrow full of rankling poison, fearfully insidious where it strikes a foe! See now! with all my force, I point it! and are you resting in the face of such calamity? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1055</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How is it that you fear not this dread arrow? say! why do you not tremble?' Mâra uttered such fear-inspiring threats, bent on overawing Bodhisattva. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1056</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>But Bodhisattva's heart remained unmoved; no doubt, no fear was present. Then Mâra instantly discharged his arrow, whilst the three women came in front; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1057</font></span></p>  
 <p>Bodhisattva regarded not the arrow, nor considered ought the women three. Mâra râ<i>g</i>a now was troubled much with doubt, and muttered thus 'twixt heart and mouth: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1058</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Long since the maiden of the snowy mountains, shooting at Mahe<i>s</i>vara, constrained him to change his mind; and yet Bodhisattva is unmoved, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1059</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And heeds not even this dart of mine, nor the three heavenly women! nought prevails to move his heart or raise one spark of love within him. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1060</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now must I assemble my army-host, and press him sore by force;' having thought thus awhile, Mâra's army suddenly assembled round; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1061</font></span></p>  
 <p>Each (severally) assumed his own peculiar form; some were holding spears, others grasping swords, others snatching up trees, others wielding diamond maces; (thus were they) armed with every sort of weapon; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1062</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some had heads like hogs, others like fishes, others like asses, others like horses; some with forms like snakes or like the ox or savage tiger; lion-headed, dragon-headed, (and like) every other kind of beast; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1063</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some had many heads on one body-trunk, with faces having but a single eye, and then again with many eyes; some with great-bellied mighty bodies, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1064</font></span></p>  
 <p>And others thin and skinny, bellyless; others long-legged, mighty-knee’d; others big-shanked</p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>and fat-calved; some with long and claw-like nails; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1065</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some were headless, breastless, faceless; some with two feet and many bodies; some with big faces looking every way; some pale and ashy-coloured, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1066</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others colour’d like the bright star rising, others steaming fiery vapour, some with ears like elephants, with humps like mountains, some with naked forms covered with hair, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1067</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some with leather skins for clothing, their faces party-coloured, crimson and white; some with tiger skins as robes, some with snake skins over them, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1068</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some with tinkling bells around their waists, others with twisted screw-like hair, others with hair dishevelled covering the body, some breath-suckers, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1069</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others body-snatchers, some dancing and shrieking awhile, some jumping onwards with their feet together, some striking one another as they went, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1070</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others waving (wheeling round) in the air, others flying and leaping between the trees, others howling, or hooting, or screaming, or whining, with their evil noises shaking the great earth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1071</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus this wicked goblin troop encircled on its four sides the Bodhi tree; some bent on tearing his body to pieces, others on devouring it whole; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1072</font></span></p>  
 <p>From the four sides flames belched forth, and fiery steam ascended up to heaven; tempestuous winds arose on every side <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">1</font></a>; the mountain forests shook and quaked; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1073</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>Wind, fire, and steam, with dust combined, (produced) a pitchy darkness, rendering all invisible. And now the Devas well affected to the law, and all the Nâgas and the spirits (kwei-shin), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1074</font></span></p>  
 <p>All incensed at this host of Mâra, with anger fired, wept tears of blood; the great company of <i>S</i>uddhavâsa gods, beholding Mâra tempting <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">1</font></a> Bodhisattva, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1075</font></span></p>  
 <p>Free from low-feeling, with hearts undisturbed by passion, moved by pity towards him and commiseration, came in a body to behold the Bodhisattva, so calmly seated and so undisturbed, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1076</font></span></p>  
 <p>Surrounded with an uncounted host of devils, shaking the heaven and earth with sounds ill-omened. Bodhisattva silent and quiet in the midst remained, his countenance as bright as heretofore, unchanged; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1077</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like the great lion-king placed amongst all the beasts howling and growling round him (so he sat), a sight unseen before, so strange and wonderful! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1078</font></span></p>  
 <p>The host of Mâra hastening, as arranged, each one exerting his utmost force, taking each other's place in turns, threatening every moment to destroy him, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1079</font></span></p>  
 <p>Fiercely staring, grinning with their teeth, flying tumultuously, bounding here and there; but Bodhisattva, silently beholding them, (watched them) as one would watch the games of children; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1080</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the demon host waxed fiercer and more angry, and added force to force, in further conflict; grasping at stones they could not lift, or lifting them, they could not let them go; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1081</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>  
 <p>Their flying spears, lances, and javelins, stuck fast in space, refusing to descend; the angry thunder-drops and mighty hail, with these, were changed into five-colour’d lotus flowers, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1082</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst the foul poison of the dragon snakes was turned to spicy-breathing air. Thus all these countless sorts of creatures, wishing to destroy the Bodhisattva, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1083</font></span></p>  
 <p>Unable to remove him from the spot, were with their own weapons wounded. Now Mâra had an aunt-attendant whose name was Ma-kia-ka-li (Mâha Kâlî?), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1084</font></span></p>  
 <p>Who held a skull-dish in her hands, and stood in front of Bodhisattva, and with every kind of winsome gesture, tempted to lust the Bodhisattva. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1085</font></span></p>  
 <p>So all these followers of Mâra, possessed of every demon-body form, united in discordant uproar, hoping to terrify Bodhisattva; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1086</font></span></p>  
 <p>But not a hair of his was moved, and Mâra's host was filled with sorrow. Then in the air the crowd of angels (spirits), their forms invisible, raised their voices, saying: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1087</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Behold the great Muni; his mind unmoved by any feeling of resentment, whilst all that wicked Mâra race, besotted, are vainly bent on his destruction; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1088</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Let go your foul and murderous thoughts against that silent Muni, calmly seated! You cannot with a breath move the Sumeru mountain; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1089</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Fire may freeze, water may burn, the roughened earth may grow soft and pliant, but ye cannot hurt the Bodhisattva! Thro’ ages past disciplined by suffering, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1090</font></span></p>  
 <p>Bodhisattva rightly trained in thought, ever</p>  
 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>  
 <p>advancing in the use of "means," pure and illustrious for wisdom, loving and merciful to all, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1091</font></span></p>  
 <p>'These four conspicuous (excellent) virtues cannot with him be rent asunder, so as to make it hard or doubtful whether he gain the highest wisdom. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1092</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For as the thousand rays of yonder sun must drown the darkness of the world, or as the boring wood must kindle fire, or as the earth deep-dug gives water, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1093</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So he who perseveres in the "right means," by seeking thus, will find. The world without instruction, poisoned by lust and hate and ignorance, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1094</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Because he pitied "flesh," so circumstanced, he sought on their account the joy of wisdom. Why then would you molest and hinder one who seeks to banish sorrow from the world? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1095</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The ignorance that everywhere prevails is due to false pernicious books (sûtras), and therefore Bodhisattva, walking uprightly, would lead and draw men after him. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1096</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To obscure and blind the great world-leader, this undertaking is impossible <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for ’tis as though in the Great Desert a man would purposely mislead the merchant-guide; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1097</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So "all flesh" having fallen into darkness, ignorant of where they are going, for their sakes he would light the lamp of wisdom; say then! why would you extinguish it? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1098</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All flesh engulphed and overwhelmed in the great sea of birth and death, this one prepares the boat of wisdom; say then! why destroy and sink it? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1099</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Patience is the sprouting of religion, firmness</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>  
 <p>its root, good conduct is the flower, the enlightened heart the boughs and branches, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1100</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Wisdom supreme the entire tree, the "transcendent law <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">1</font></a>" the fruit, its shade protects all living things; say then! why would you cut it down? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1101</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Lust, hate, and ignorance, (these are) the rack and bolt, the yoke placed on the shoulder of the world; through ages long he has practised austerities to rescue men from these their fetters, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1102</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He now shall certainly attain his end, sitting on this right-established throne; (seated) as all the previous Buddhas, firm and compact like a diamond; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1103</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Though all the earth were moved and shaken, yet would this place be fixed and stable; him, thus fixed and well assured, think not that you can overturn. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1104</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Bring down and moderate your mind's desire, banish these high and envious thoughts, prepare yourselves for right reflection, be patient in your services.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1105</font></span></p>  
 <p>Mâra hearing these sounds in space, and seeing Bodhisattva still unmoved, filled with fear and banishing his high and supercilious thoughts, again took up his way to heaven above; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1106</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst all his host (were scattered), o’erwhelmed with grief and disappointment, fallen from their high estate, ’reft of their warrior pride, their warlike weapons and accoutrements thrown heedlessly and cast away 'mid woods and deserts. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1107</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like as when some cruel chieftain slain, the hateful</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>  
 <p>band is all dispersed and scattered, so the host of Mâra disconcerted, fled away. The mind of Bodhisattva (now reposed) peaceful and quiet. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1108</font></span></p>  
 <p>The morning sun-beams brighten with the dawn, the dust-like mist dispersing, disappears; the moon and stars pale their faint light, the barriers of the night are all removed, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1109</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst from above a fall of heavenly flowers pay their sweet tribute to the Bodhisattva. 1110.</p>
