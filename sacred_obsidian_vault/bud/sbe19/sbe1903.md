THE BIRTH.</h3>  
 <p>(There was) a descendant of the Ikshvâku <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">1</font></a> (family), an invincible <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>S</i>âkya monarch, pure in mind (mental gifts) and of unspotted virtue, called therefore 'Pure-rice' (<i>S</i>uddhodana). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1</font></span></p>  
 <p>Joyously reverenced by all men (or, 'beings'), as the new moon (is welcomed by the world), the king indeed (was) like the heaven-ruler <i>S</i>akra <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">3</font></a>, his queen like (the divine) <i>S</i>a<i>k</i>î. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2</font></span></p>  
 <p>Strong and calm of purpose as the earth, pure in mind as the water-lily, her name, figuratively assumed, Mâyâ, she was in truth incapable of class-comparison. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 3</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a></p>  
 <p>On her in likeness as the heavenly queen descended the spirit and entered her womb. A mother, but free from grief or pain, (she was) without any false or illusory <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">1</font></a> mind. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 4</font></span></p>  
 <p>Disliking the clamorous ways of the world, (she remembered) the excellent garden of Lumbinî, a pleasant spot, a quiet forest retreat, (with its) trickling fountains, and blooming flowers and fruits. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 5</font></span></p>  
 <p>Quiet and peaceful, delighting in meditation, respectfully she asked the king for liberty to roam therein; the king, understanding her earnest desire, was seized with a seldom-felt anxiety (to grant her request). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 6</font></span></p>  
 <p>He commanded his kinsfolk, within and without (the palace), to repair with her to that garden shade; and now the queen Mâyâ knew that her time for child-bearing was come. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 7</font></span></p>  
 <p>She rested calmly on a beautiful couch, (surrounded by) a hundred thousand female attendants; (it was) the eighth day of the fourth moon, a season of serene and agreeable character. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 8</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst she (thus) religiously observed <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">2</font></a> the rules of a pure discipline, Bodhisattva was born from her right side, (come) to deliver the world, constrained by great pity, without causing his mother pain or anguish. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 9</font></span></p>  
 <p>As king Yu-liu <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">3</font></a> was born from the thigh, as king Pi-t’au <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">4</font></a> was born from the hand, as king Man-to <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p>was born from the top of the head, as king Kia-<i>k</i>’<i>h</i>a <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a> was born from the arm-pit, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 10</font></span></p>  
 <p>So also was Bodhisattva on the day of his birth produced from the right side; gradually emerging from the womb, he shed in every direction the rays of his glory. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 11</font></span></p>  
 <p>As one (born) from recumbent space <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and not through the gates of life, through countless kalpas, practising virtue, self-conscious he came forth to life, without confusion. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 12</font></span></p>  
 <p>Calm and collected, not falling headlong (was he born), gloriously manifested, perfectly adorned, sparkling with light he came from the womb <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">3</font></a>, as when the sun first rises (from the East). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 13</font></span></p>  
 <p>(Men) indeed regarded <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">4</font></a> his exceeding great glory, yet their sight remained uninjured: he allowed them to gaze, the brightness of his person concealed for the time, as when we look upon the moon in the heavens. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 14</font></span></p>  
 <p>His body, nevertheless, was effulgent with light, and like the sun which eclipses the shining of the lamp, so the true gold-like beauty of Bodhisattva shone forth and was diffused everywhere. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 15</font></span></p>  
 <p>Upright and firm and unconfused in mind, he deliberately took seven steps <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the soles of his feet</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p>resting evenly upon the ground as he went, his footmarks remained bright as seven stars. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 16</font></span></p>  
 <p>Moving like the lion, king of beasts, and looking earnestly towards; the four quarters, penetrating to the centre the principles of truth, he spake thus with the fullest assurance: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 17</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This birth is in the condition of a Buddha <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">1</font></a>; after this I have done with renewed birth; now only am I born this once, for the purpose of saving all the world.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 18</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now from the midst of heaven there descended two streams of pure water, one warm, the other cold, and baptized his head <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">2</font></a>, causing refreshment to his body. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 19</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now he is placed in the precious palace hall, a jewelled couch for him to sleep upon, and the heavenly kings with their golden flowery hands hold fast the four feet of the bed. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 20</font></span></p>  
 <p>Meanwhile the Devas in space, seizing their jewelled canopies, attending, raise in responsive harmony their heavenly songs, to encourage him to accomplish his perfect purpose <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 21</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the Nâga-râ<i>g</i>as filled with joy, earnestly desiring to show their reverence for the most excellent law <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as they had paid honour to the former Buddhas, now went to meet Bodhisattva; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 22</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>They scattered before him Mandâra flowers, rejoicing with heartfelt joy to pay such religious homage; (and so, again,) Tathâgata having appeared in the world, the <i>S</i>uddha <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> angels rejoiced with gladness; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 23</font></span></p>  
 <p>With no selfish or partial joy, but for the sake of religion they rejoiced, because creation <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">2</font></a>, engulfed in the ocean of pain, was now to obtain perfect release. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 24</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the precious Mountain-râ<i>g</i>a, Sume(ru) <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">3</font></a>, firmly holding this great earth <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">4</font></a> when Bodhisattva appeared in the world, was swayed by the wind of his perfected merit. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 25</font></span></p>  
 <p>On every hand the world was greatly shaken, as the wind drives the tossing boat; so also the minutest atoms of sandal perfume, and the hidden sweetness of precious lilies, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 26</font></span></p>  
 <p>Floated on the air and rose through space and then commingling came back to earth; so again the garments of Devas descending from heaven touching the body, caused delightful thrills of joy; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 27</font></span></p>  
 <p>The sun and moon with constant course redoubled the brilliancy of their light, whilst in the world the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>  
 <p>fire's gleam of itself prevailed without the use of fuel. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 28</font></span></p>  
 <p>Pure water, cool and refreshing from the springs, flowed here-and there, self-caused; in the palace all the waiting women were filled with joy at such an unprecedented event. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 29</font></span></p>  
 <p>Proceeding all in company, they drink and bathe themselves; in all arose calm and delightful thoughts; countless inferior Devas (bhûtas), delighting in religion, like clouds assembled. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 30</font></span></p>  
 <p>In the garden of Lumbinî, filling the spaces between the trees, rare and special flowers, in great abundance, bloomed out of season. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 31</font></span></p>  
 <p>All cruel and malevolent kinds of beings, together conceived a loving heart; all diseases and afflictions among men without a cure applied, of themselves were healed. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 32</font></span></p>  
 <p>The various cries and confused sounds of beasts were hushed and silence reigned; the stagnant water of the river-courses flowed apace, whilst the polluted streams became clear and pure. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 33</font></span></p>  
 <p>No clouds gathered throughout the heavens, whilst angelic music, self-caused, was heard around; the whole world of sentient creatures enjoyed peace and universal tranquillity. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 34</font></span></p>  
 <p>Just as when a country visited by desolation, suddenly obtains .an enlightened ruler, so when Bodhisattva was born, he came to remove the sorrows of all living things. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 35</font></span></p>  
 <p>Mâra <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the heavenly monarch, alone was grieved and rejoiced not. The Royal Father (<i>S</i>uddhodana)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>beholding his son <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a>, strange and miraculous <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as to his birth, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 36</font></span></p>  
 <p>Though self-possessed and assured in his soul, was yet moved with astonishment and his countenance changed, whilst he alternately weighed with himself the meaning (of such an event), now rejoiced and now distressed. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 37</font></span></p>  
 <p>The queen-mother beholding her child, born thus contrary to laws of nature, her timorous woman's heart was doubtful; her mind through fear, swayed between extremes: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 38</font></span></p>  
 <p>Not distinguishing the happy from the sad portents, again and again she gave way to grief <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and now the aged women of the world, (of the 'long night <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">4</font></a>') in a confused way supplicating heavenly guidance, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 39</font></span></p>  
 <p>Implored the gods to whom their rites were paid, to bless the child; (cause peace to rest upon the royal child.) Now there was at this time in the grove, a certain soothsayer <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">5</font></a>, a Brahman, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 40</font></span></p>  
 <p>Of dignified mien and wide-spread renown, famed for his skill and scholarship: beholding the signs <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">6</font></a>, his</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>heart rejoiced, and he exulted at the miraculous event. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 41</font></span></p>  
 <p>Knowing the king's mind to be somewhat perplexed, he addressed him (thus) with truth and earnestness, 'Men born in the world, chiefly desire to have a son the most renowned <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 42</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But now the king, like the moon when full, should feel in himself a perfect joy, having begotten an unequalled <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">2</font></a> son, (for by this the king) will become illustrious among his race; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 43</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Let then his heart be joyful and glad, banish all anxiety and doubt, the spiritual omens that are everywhere, manifested indicate for your house and dominion a course of continued prosperity <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 44</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The most excellently endowed child now born will bring deliverance to the entire world <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">4</font></a>, none but a heavenly teacher has a body such as this <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">5</font></a>, golden colour’d, gloriously resplendent. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 45</font></span></p>  
 <p>'One endowed with such transcendent marks, must reach the state of "Samyak <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">6</font></a>-Sambodhi," or if he be induced to engage in worldly delights, then he must become a universal monarch <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">7</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 46</font></span></p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Everywhere recognised as the ruler of the great earth, mighty in his righteous government, as a monarch ruling the four empires <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a>, uniting under his sway all other rulers; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 47</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As among all lesser lights, the sun's brightness is by far the most excellent. But if he seek a dwelling among the mountain forests, with single heart searching for deliverance <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 48</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having arrived at the perfection of true wisdom, he will become illustrious <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">3</font></a> throughout the world; for as mount Sumeru is monarch among all mountains, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 49</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Or, as gold is chief among all precious things, or, as the ocean is supreme among all streams <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or, as the moon is first among the stars, or, as the sun is brightest of all luminaries, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 50</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So Tathâgata, born in the world, is the most eminent <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">5</font></a> of men; his eyes clear and expanding <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the lashes both above and below moving with the lid, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 51</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The iris of the eye of a clear blue colour <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">7</font></a>, in shape like the moon when half full, such characteristics as these, without contradiction, foreshadow the most excellent condition of perfect (wisdom).' 52.</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>At this time the king addressed the twice-born <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">1</font></a>, 'If it be as you say, with respect to these miraculous signs, that they indicate such consequences, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 53</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Then no such case has happened with former kings, nor down to our time has such a thing occurred.' The Brahman addressed the king thus, 'Say not so; for it is not right; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 54</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For with regard to renown and wisdom, personal celebrity, and worldly substance, these four things indeed are not to be considered according to precedent or subsequence; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 55</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But whatever is produced according to nature <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">2</font></a>, such things are liable to the law of cause and effect: but now whilst I recount some parallels let the king attentively listen; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 56</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Bh<i>ri</i>gu, Aṅgira <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">3</font></a> (Aṅgiras?), these two of <i>Ri</i>shi family <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">4</font></a>, having passed many years apart from men, each begat an excellently-endowed son, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 57</font></span></p>  
 <p>'B<i>ri</i>haspati with <i>S</i>ukra, skilful in making royal treatises, not derived from former families (or, tribes); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 58</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Sârasvata, the <i>Ri</i>shi, whose works <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">5</font></a> have long disappeared, begat a son, Po-lo-sa <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">6</font></a>, who compiled illustrious Sutras <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">7</font></a> and Shâstras; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 59</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>'That which now we know and see, is not therefore dependent on previous connection; Vyâsa, the <i>Ri</i>shi, the author of numerous treatises, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 60</font></span></p>  
 <p>'After his death had among his descendants, Poh-mi (Vâlmîki), who extensively collected Gâthâ sections; Atri, the <i>Ri</i>shi, not understanding the sectional treatise on medicine, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 61</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Afterwards begat Âtreya, who was able to control diseases; the twice-born <i>Ri</i>shi Kusi (Ku<i>s</i>ika), not occupied with heretical treatises, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 62</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Afterwards (begat) Kia-ti-na râ<i>g</i>a, who thoroughly understood heretical systems; the sugar-cane monarch <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who began his line, could not restrain the tide of the sea, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 63</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But Sagara-râ<i>g</i>a, his descendant, who begat a thousand royal sons, he could control the tide of the great sea so that it should come no further. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 64</font></span></p>  
 <p>'<i>G</i>anaka, the <i>Ri</i>shi, without a teacher acquired power of abstraction. All these, who obtained such renown, acquired powers of themselves <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 65</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Those distinguished before, were afterwards forgotten; those before forgotten, became afterwards distinguished <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">3</font></a>; kings like these and godlike <i>Ri</i>shis have no need of family inheritance, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 66</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And therefore the world need not regard those going before or following. So, mighty king! is it with you, you should experience true joy of heart, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 67</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And because of this joy should banish for ever doubt or anxiety.' The king hearing the words</p>

 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the seer was glad, and offered him increased gifts <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 68</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now have I begotten a valiant (excellent) son (he said), who will establish a wheel authority, whilst I, when old and grey-headed, will go forth to lead a hermit's life <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 69</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So that my holy king-like son may not give up the world and wander through mountain forests.' And now near the spot within the garden, there was a <i>Ri</i>shi, leading the life of an ascetic <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 70</font></span></p>  
 <p>His name was Asita, wonderfully skilful in the interpretation of signs; he approached the gate of the palace; the king (beholding him) exclaimed, 'This is none other but Brahmadeva, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 71</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Himself enduring penance from love of true religion, these two characteristics <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">4</font></a> so plainly visible as marks of his austerities.' Then the king was much rejoiced; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 72</font></span></p>  
 <p>And forthwith he invited him within the palace, and with reverence set before him entertainment, whilst he, entering the inner palace, rejoiced only (in prospect of) seeing the royal child. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 73</font></span></p>  
 <p>Although surrounded by the crowd of court-ladies, yet still he was as if in desert solitude; and now they place a preaching throne and pay him increased honour and religious reverence, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 74</font></span></p>  
 <p>As Antideva râ<i>g</i>a reverenced the priest Vasish<i>th</i>a. Then the king addressing the <i>Ri</i>shi, said, 'Most fortunate am I, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 75</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Great <i>Ri</i>shi! that you have condescended to</p>

 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>come here to receive from me becoming gifts and reverence; I pray you therefore enter on your exhortation.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 76</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus requested and invited the <i>Ri</i>shi felt unutterable joy, and said, 'All hail, ever victorious monarch! possessed of all noble (virtuous) qualities <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 77</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Loving to meet the desires of those who seek, nobly generous in honouring the true law, conspicuous as a race for wisdom and humanity, with humble mind you pay me homage, as you are bound. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 78</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Because of your righteous deeds in former lives <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">2</font></a>, now are manifested these excellent fruits; listen to me, then, whilst I declare the reason of the present meeting. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 79</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As I was coming on the sun's way <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">3</font></a>, I heard the Devas in space declare that the king had born to him (begotten) a royal son, who would arrive at perfect intelligence <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">4</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 80</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Moreover I beheld such other portents <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">5</font></a>, as have</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>constrained me now to seek your presence; desiring to see the <i>S</i>âkya monarch who will erect the standard of the true law.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 81</font></span></p>  
 <p>The king hearing the <i>Ri</i>shi's. words was fully assured; escaping from the net of doubt, he ordered an attendant to bring the prince, to exhibit him to the <i>Ri</i>shi. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 82</font></span></p>  
 <p>The <i>Ri</i>shi, beholding the prince, the thousand-rayed wheel on the soles of his feet, the web-like filament between his fingers <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>, between his eyebrows the white <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a> wool-like prominence, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 83</font></span></p>  
 <p>His privy parts hidden as those of the horse, his complexion bright and lustrous; seeing these wonderful birth-portents, the seer wept and sighed deeply. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 84</font></span></p>  
 <p>The king beholding the tears of the <i>Ri</i>shi, thinking of his son, his soul was overcome, and his breath fast held his swelling heart. Thus alarmed and ill at ease, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 85</font></span></p>  
 <p>Unconsciously he arose from his seat, and, bowing his head at the <i>Ri</i>shi's feet he addressed him in these words, 'This son of mine, born thus wonderfully, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 86</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Beautiful in face, and surpassingly graceful, little different from the gods in form, giving promise of superiority in the world, ah! why has he caused thee grief and pain? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 87</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Forbid it, that my son should die! (should be short-lived!)--(the thought) creates in me grief and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>anxiety; that one athirst, within reach of the eternal draught <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a>, should after all reject and lose it! sad indeed! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 88</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Forbid it, he should lose his wealth and treasure! dead to his house! lost to his country! for he who has <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">2</font></a> a prosperous son in life, gives pledge that his country's weal is well secured; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 89</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And then, coming to die, my heart will rest content, rejoicing in the thought. of offspring surviving me; even as a man possessed of two eyes, one of which keeps watch, while the other sleeps; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 90</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not like the frost-flower of autumn, which though it seems to bloom, is not a reality. A man who, midst his tribe and kindred, deeply loves a spotless son, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 91</font></span></p>  
 <p>'At every proper time in recollection of it has joy; O! that you would cause me to revive <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">3</font></a>!' The <i>Ri</i>shi, knowing the king-sire to be thus greatly afflicted at heart, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 92</font></span></p>  
 <p>Immediately addressed the Maharâ<i>g</i>a: 'Let not the king be for a moment anxious! the words I have spoken to the king, let him ponder these, and not permit himself to doubt; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 93</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The portents now are as they were before, cherish</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>then no other thoughts! But recollecting I myself am old, on that account I could not hold my tears; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 94</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For now my end is coming on. But this son of thine will rule the world, born for the sake of all that lives <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">1</font></a>! this is indeed one difficult to meet with; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 95</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He shall give up his royal estate, escape from the domain of the five desires  <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with resolution and with diligence practise austerities, and then awakening, grasp the truth. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 96</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Then constantly, for the world's sake (all living things), destroying the impediments of ignorance and darkness, he shall give to all enduring light, the brightness of the sun of perfect wisdom. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 97</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All flesh submerged in the sea of sorrow; all diseases collected as the bubbling froth; decay and age like the wild billows; death like the engulfing ocean; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 98</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Embarking lightly in the boat of wisdom he will save the world from all these perils, by wisdom stemming back the flood. His, pure teaching like to the neighbouring shore, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 99</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The power of meditation, like a cool lake, will be enough for all the unexpected birds; thus deep and full and wide is the great river of the true law; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 100</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All creatures parched by the drought of lust may freely drink thereof, without stint; those</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>enchained in the domain of the five desires, those driven along by many sorrows, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 101</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And deceived amid the wilderness of birth and death, in ignorance of the way of escape, for these Bodhisattva has been born in the world, to open out a way of salvation <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 102</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The fire of lust and covetousness, burning with the fuel of the objects of sense, (on the flames) he has caused the cloud of his mercy to rise, so that the rain of the law may extinguish them. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 103</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The heavy gates of gloomy unbelief, fast kept by covetousness and lust, within which are confined all living things, he opens and gives free deliverance. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 104</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With the tweezers of his diamond wisdom he plucks out the opposing principles of lustful desire. In the self-twined meshes of folly and ignorance all flesh poor and in misery, helplessly (lying), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 105</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The king of the law has come forth, to rescue these from bondage. Let not the king in respect of this his son encourage in himself one thought of doubt or pain; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 106</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But rather let him grieve on account of the world, led captive by desire, opposed to truth; but I, indeed, amid the ruins of old age and death, am far removed from the meritorious condition of the holy one <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 107</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Possessed indeed of powers of abstraction, yet</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>not within reach of the gain he will give, to be derived from his teaching as the Bodhisattva; not permitted to hear his righteous law, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 108</font></span></p>  
 <p>'My body worn out, after death, alas! (destined) to be born as a Deva <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a> still liable to the three calamities (old age, decay, and death), (therefore I weep).' The king and all his household attendants, hearing the words of the <i>Ri</i>shi, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 109</font></span></p>  
 <p>Knowing the cause of his regretful sorrow, banished from their minds all further anxiety: 'And now (the king. said) to have begotten this excellent son, gives me rest at heart; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 110</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But that he should leave his kingdom and home, and practise the life of an ascetic, not anxious to ensure the stability of the kingdom, the thought of this still brings with it pain.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 111</font></span></p>  
 <p>At this time the <i>Ri</i>shi, turning to the king with true words, said, 'It must be even as the king anticipates, he will surely arrive at perfect enlightenment.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 112</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus having appeased every anxious heart among the king's household, (the <i>Ri</i>shi) by his own inherent spiritual power ascended into space and disappeared. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 113</font></span></p>  
 <p>At this time <i>S</i>uddhodana râ<i>g</i>a, seeing the excellent marks (predictive signs) of his son, and, moreover, hearing the words of Asita, certifying that which would surely happen, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 114</font></span></p>  
 <p>Was greatly affected with reverence to the child, he redoubled measures for its protection, and (was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>filled) with constant thought; (moreover) he issued decrees through the empire, to liberate all captives in prison, 115.</p>  
 <p>According to the custom when a (royal) son was born, giving the usual largess, in agreement with the directions of the Sacred Books, and extending his gifts to all; (or, all these things he did completely). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 116</font></span></p>  
 <p>The child <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">1</font></a> when ten days old, (his father's) mind being now quite tranquil, he announced a sacrifice to all the gods, and prepared to give liberal offerings to all the religious bodies; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 117</font></span></p>  
 <p><i>S</i>râma<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as invoked by their prayers a blessing from the gods, whilst he bestowed gifts on the royal kinspeople and the ministers and the poor within the country; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 118</font></span></p>  
 <p>The women who dwelt in the city or the villages, (all those who needed) cattle or horses or elephants or money, each, according to his necessities, was liberally supplied; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 119</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then selecting by divination a lucky time, they took the child back to his own palace; with a double-feeding white-pure-tooth <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">2</font></a>, carried in a richly-adorned chariot (cradle), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 120</font></span></p>  
 <p>With ornaments of every kind and colour round his neck; shining with beauty, exceedingly resplendent with unguents. The queen embracing</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>him in her arms, going around, worshipped the heavenly spirits. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 121</font></span></p>  
 <p>Afterwards she remounted her precious chariot, surrounded by her waiting women; the king, with his ministers and people, and all the crowd of attendants, leading the way and following, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 122</font></span></p>  
 <p>Even as the ruler of heaven, <i>S</i>akra, is surrounded by crowds of Devas; as Mahe<i>s</i>vara, when suddenly his six-faced child was born, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 123</font></span></p>  
 <p>Arranging every kind of present, gave gifts, and asked for blessings; so now the king, when his royal son was born, made all his arrangements in like manner; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 124</font></span></p>  
 <p>So Vai<i>s</i>rava<i>n</i>a, the heavenly king, when Nalakûvara <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a> was born, surrounded by a concourse of Devas, was filled with joy and much gladness; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 125</font></span></p>  
 <p>So the king, now the royal prince was born, in the kingdom of Kapila, his people and all his subjects were likewise filled with joy. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 126</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="sbe1903.htm#fr_52">9:4</a> The ocean is always in Buddhist works, as in Homer, associated with 'flowings.' The expression in the Chinese, liu-hai, corresponds exactly with Ὠκεανοῖο ῥέεθρα.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_71"></a><a href="sbe1903.htm#fr_71">13:2</a> The expression suh <i>kh</i>ih points to conduct in former conditions of existence.
