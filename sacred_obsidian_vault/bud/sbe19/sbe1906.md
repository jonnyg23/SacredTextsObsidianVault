 <p>The prince on entering the garden, the women came around to pay him court; and to arouse in him thoughts frivolous; with ogling ways and deep design, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 254</font></span></p>  
 <p>Each one setting herself off to best advantage; or joining together in harmonious concert, clapping their hands, or moving their feet in unison, or joining close, body to body, limb to limb; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 255</font></span></p>  
 <p>Or indulging in smart repartees, and mutual smiles; or assuming a thoughtful saddened countenance, and so by sympathy to please the prince, and provoke in him a heart affected by love. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 256</font></span></p>  
 <p>But all the women beheld the prince, clouded in brow, and his godlike body not exhibiting its wonted signs of beauty; fair in bodily appearance, surpassingly lovely <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 251</font></span></p>  
 <p>All looked upwards as they gazed, as when we call upon the moon Deva to come <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but all their subtle devices <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">3</font></a> were ineffectual to move Bodhisattva's heart. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 258</font></span></p>  
 <p>At last commingling together they join and look astonished and in fear, silent without a word. Then there was a Brahmaputra, whose name was called Udâyi <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">4</font></a> (Yau-to-i). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 259</font></span></p>  
 <p>(He) addressing the women, said, 'Now all of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>you, so graceful and fair, (see if you cannot) by your combined power hit on some device; for beauty's power is not for ever. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 260</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Still it holds the world in bondage, by secret ways and lustful arts; but no such loveliness in all the world (as yours), equal to that of heavenly nymphs <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 261</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The gods beholding it would leave their queens, spirits and <i>Ri</i>shis would be misled by it; why not then the prince, the son of an earthly king <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a>? why should not his feelings be aroused? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 262</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This prince indeed, though he restrains his heart and holds it fixed <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">3</font></a>, pure-minded, with virtue uncontaminated, not to be overcome by power of women; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 263</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(Yet) of old there was Sundarî (Su-to-li) able to destroy the great <i>Ri</i>shi, and to lead him to indulge in love, and so degrade his boasted eminence <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">4</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 264</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Undergoing long penance, Gautama fell likewise (by the arts of) a heavenly queen; Shing-kü, a <i>Ri</i>shi putra, practising lustful indulgences according to fancy <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">5</font></a>, (was lost). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 265</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The Brahman <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra (Pi-she-po), living religiously <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">6</font></a> for ten thousand years, deeply</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>ensnared by a heavenly queen, in one day was completely shipwreck’d in faith <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 266</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thus those enticing women, by their power, overcame the Brahman ascetics how much more may ye, by your arts, overpower (the resolves) of the king's son; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 267</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Strive therefore after new devices <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">2</font></a>, let not the king fail in a successor to the throne; women, altho’ naturally weak <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">3</font></a>, are high and potent in the way of ruling men. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 268</font></span></p>  
 <p>'What may not their arts accomplish in promoting in men a lustful (impure) desire?' At this time all the attendant women, hearing throughout the words of Udâyi, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 269</font></span></p>  
 <p>Increasing their powers of pleasing, as the quiet horse when touched by the whip, went into the presence of the royal prince, and each one strove in the practice of every kind of art, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 270</font></span></p>  
 <p>(They) joined in music and in smiling conversation, raising their eyebrows, showing their white teeth, with ogling looks, glancing one at the other, their light drapery exhibiting their white bodies, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 271</font></span></p>  
 <p>Daintily moving with mincing gait, acting the part of a bride as if coming gradually nearer <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">4</font></a>, desiring to promote in him a feeling of love, remembering the words of the great king <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">5</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 272</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>'With dissolute form and slightly clad, forgetful of modesty and womanly reserve.' The prince with resolute heart was silent and still, with unmoved face (he sat); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 273</font></span></p>  
 <p>Even as the great elephant-dragon, whilst the entire herd moves round him <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">1</font></a>; so nothing could disturb or move his heart, dwelling in their midst as in a confined room <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 274</font></span></p>  
 <p>Like the divine <i>S</i>akra, around whom all the Devîs assemble, so was the prince as he dwelt in the gar-dens; (the maidens) encircling him thus; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 275</font></span></p>  
 <p>Some arranging their dress, others washing their hands or feet, others perfuming their bodies with scent, others twining flowers for decoration, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 276</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others making strings for jewelled necklets, others rubbing or striking their bodies, others resting, or lying, one beside the other, others, with head inclined, whispering secret words, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 277</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others engaged in common sports, others talking of amorous things, others assuming lustful attitudes, striving thus to move his heart; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 278</font></span></p>  
 <p>But Bodhisattva, peaceful and collected, firm as a rock, difficult to move, hearing all these women's talk, unaffected either to joy or sorrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 279</font></span></p>  
 <p>Was driven still more to serious thought, sighing to witness such strange conduct, and beginning to understand the women's design, by these means to disconcert his mind, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 280</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not knowing that youthful beauty soon falls, destroyed by old age and death, fading and perishing! This is the great distress! What ignorance</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>and delusion (he reflected) overshadow their minds, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 281</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Surely they ought to consider old age, disease, and death, and day and night stir themselves up to exertion, whilst this sharp double-edged sword hangs over the neck. What room for sport or laughter, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 282</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Beholding those (monsters) old age, disease, and death? A man who is unable to resort to this inward knowledge, what is he but a wooden or a plaster man, what heart-consideration in such a case! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 283</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Like the double tree that appears in the desert, with leaves and fruit all perfect and ripe, the first cut down and destroyed, the other unmoved by apprehension, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 284</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So it is in the case of the mass of men, they have no understanding either!' At this time Udâyi came to the place where the prince was, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 285</font></span></p>  
 <p>And observing his silent and thoughtful mien, unmoved by any desire for indulgence (the five desires), he forthwith addressed the prince, and said, 'The Mahâra<i>g</i>a, by his former appointment <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 286</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Has selected me to act as friend to his son; may I therefore speak some friendly words? an enlightened friendship (or, friend) is of three sorts, that which removes things unprofitable, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 287</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Promotes that which is real gain, and stands by a friend in adversity. I claim the name of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "enlightened friend," and would renounce all that is magisterial, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 288</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But yet not speak lightly or with indifference. What then are the three sources of advantage? listen, and I will now utter true words, and prove myself a true and sincere adviser. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 289</font></span></p>  
 <p>'When the years are fresh and ripening, beauty and pleasing qualities in bloom, not to give proper weight to woman's influence, this is a weak man's policy (body) <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 290</font></span></p>  
 <p>'It is right sometimes to be of a crafty mind, submitting to those little subterfuges, which find a place in the heart's undercurrents, and obeying what those thoughts suggest, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 291</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In way of pleasures to be got from dalliance, this is no wrong in woman's (eye)! even if now the heart has no desire, yet it is fair to follow such devices; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 292</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Agreement (acquiescence) is the joy of woman's heart, acquiescence is the substance (the full) of true adornment; but if a man reject these overtures, he's like a tree deprived of leaves and fruits; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 293</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Why then ought you to yield and acquiesce? that you may share in all these things. Because in taking, there's an end of trouble--no light and changeful thoughts then worry us--294</p>  
 <p>'For pleasure is the first and foremost thought of all, the gods themselves cannot dispense with it. Lord <i>S</i>akra was drawn by it to love the wife of Gautama the <i>Ri</i>shi; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 295</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So likewise the <i>Ri</i>shi Agastya, through a long</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p>period of discipline <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">1</font></a>, practising austerities, from hankering after a heavenly queen (Devî), lost all reward of his religious endeavours, 296°</p>  
 <p>'The <i>Ri</i>shi B<i>ri</i>haspati, and <i>K</i>andradeva putra; the <i>Ri</i>shi Parâ<i>s</i>ara, and Kava<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ara (Kia-pin-<i>k</i>e-lo) <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">2</font></a>: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 297</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All these, out of many others, were overcome by woman's love. How much more then, in your case, should you partake in such pleasant joys; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 298</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Nor refuse, with wilful heart, to participate in the worldly delights, which your present station, possessed of such advantages, offers you, in the presence of these attendants.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 299</font></span></p>  
 <p>At this time the royal prince, hearing the words of his friend Udâyi, so skilfully put, with such fine distinction, cleverly citing worldly instances, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 300</font></span></p>  
 <p>Answered thus to Udâyi: 'Thank you for having spoken sincerely to me, let me likewise answer you in the same way, and let your heart suspend its judgment whilst you listen; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 301</font></span></p>  
 <p>'It is not that I am careless about beauty, or am ignorant of (the power of) human joys, but only that I see on all the impress of change; therefore my heart is sad and heavy; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 302</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If these things were sure of lasting, without the ills of age, disease, and death, then would I too take my fill of love; and to the end find no disgust or sadness; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 303</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If you will undertake to cause these women's beauty not after-while to change or wither, then, though the joy of love may have its evil, still it might hold the mind in thraldom; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 304</font></span></p>  
 <p>('To know that other) men grow old, sicken, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>die, would be enough to rob such joys of satisfaction; yet how much more in their own case (knowing this) would discontentment fill the mind; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 305</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(To know) such pleasures hasten to decay, and their bodies likewise; if, notwithstanding this, men yield to the power of love, their case indeed is like the very beasts. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 306</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And now you cite the names of many <i>Ri</i>shis, who practised lustful ways in life; their cases likewise cause me sorrow, for in that they did these things, they perished. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 307</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, you cite the name of that illustrious king, who freely gratified his passions, but he, in like way, perished in the act; know, then, that he was not a conqueror (<i>G</i>ina); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 308</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With smooth words to conceal an intrigue, and to persuade one's neighbour to consent, and by consenting to defile his mind; how can this be called a just device? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 309</font></span></p>  
 <p>'It is but to seduce one with a hollow lie,--such ways are not for me to practise; or, for those who love the truth and honesty; for they are, forsooth, unrighteous ways, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 310</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And such a disposition is hard to reverence; shaping one's conduct after one's likings, liking this or that, and seeing no harm in it, what method of experience is this! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 311</font></span></p>  
 <p>'A hollow compliance, and a protesting heart, such method is not for me to follow; but this I know, old age, disease, and death, these are the great afflictions which accumulate, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 312</font></span></p>  
 <p>And overwhelm me with their presence; on these I find no friend to speak, alas! alas! Udâyi! these, after all, are the great concerns; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 313</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>'The pain of birth, old age, disease, and death; this grief is that we have to fear; the eyes see all things falling to decay, and yet the heart finds joy in following them; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 314</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But I have little strength of purpose, or command; this heart of mine is feeble and distraught, reflecting thus on age, disease, and death. Distracted, as I never was before; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 315</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Sleepless by night and day, how can I then indulge in pleasure? Old age, disease, and death consuming me, their certainty beyond a doubt, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 316</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And still to have no heavy thoughts, in truth my heart would be a log or stone.' Thus the prince, for Uda's sake, used every kind of skilful argument, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 317</font></span></p>  
 <p>Describing all the pains of pleasure; and not perceiving that the day declined. And now the waiting women all, with music and their various attractions, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 318</font></span></p>  
 <p>Seeing that all were useless for the end, with shame began to flock back to the city; the prince beholding all the gardens, bereft of their gaudy ornaments, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 319</font></span></p>  
 <p>The women all returning home, the place becoming silent and deserted, felt with twofold strength the thought of impermanence. With saddened mien going back, he entered his palace; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 320</font></span></p>  
 <p>The king, his father, hearing of the prince, his heart estranged from thoughts of pleasure, was greatly overcome with sorrow, and like a sword it pierced his heart. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 321</font></span></p>  
 <p>Forthwith assembling all his council, he sought of them some means to gain his end; they all replied, 'These sources of desire are not enough to hold and captivate his heart.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 322</font></span></p>
