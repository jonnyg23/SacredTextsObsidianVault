   <h3 align="center">VARGA 20. RECEIVING THE <i>G</i>ETAVANA VIHÂRA.</h3>  
 <p>The lord of the world, having converted <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">2</font></a> the people of Kapilavastu according to (their several) circumstances <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">3</font></a>, his work being done, he went with the great body of his followers, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1611</font></span></p>  
 <p>And directed his way to the country of Ko<i>s</i>ala, where dwelt king Prasena<i>g</i>it (Po-se-nih). The <i>G</i>etavana was now fully adorned, and its halls and courts carefully prepared; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1612</font></span></p>  
 <p>The fountains and streams flowed through the garden which glittered with flowers and fruit; rare birds sat by the pools (water side), and on the land</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p>  
 <p>they sang in sweet concord, according to their kind; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1613</font></span></p>  
 <p>Beautiful in every way as the palace of Mount Kilas (Kailâsa) <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (such was the <i>G</i>etavana.) Then the noble friend of the orphans, surrounded by his attendants, who met him on the way, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1614</font></span></p>  
 <p>Scattering flowers and burning incense, invited the lord to enter the <i>G</i>etavana. In his hand he carried a golden dragon-pitcher <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and bending low upon his knees he poured the flowing water <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1615</font></span></p>  
 <p>As a sign of the gift of the <i>G</i>etavana Vihâra for the use of the priesthood throughout the world <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">3</font></a>. The lord then received it, with the prayer <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">4</font></a> that 'overruling all evil influences it might give the kingdom permanent rest, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1616</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And that the happiness of Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada might flow out in countless streams.' Then the king Prasena<i>g</i>it hearing that the lord had come, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1617</font></span></p>  
 <p>With his royal equipage went to the <i>G</i>etavana to worship at the lord's feet <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">5</font></a>. (Having arrived) and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p>taken a seat on one side, with clasped hands he spake to Buddha thus: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1618</font></span></p>  
 <p>'O that my unworthy and obscure kingdom should thus suddenly have met such fortune! For how can misfortunes or frequent calamities possibly affect it, (in the presence of) so great a man? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1619</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And now that I have seen your sacred features, I may perhaps partake of the converting streams of your teaching. A town although it is composed of many sections <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">1</font></a>, yet both ignoble and holy persons may enter the surpassing <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">2</font></a> stream; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1620</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And so the wind which fans the perfumed grove causes the scents to unite and form one pleasant breeze; and as the birds which collect on Mount Sumeru (are many), and the various shades that blend in shining gold, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1621</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So an assembly may consist of persons of different capacities, individually insignificant, but a glorious body. The desert master by nourishing the <i>Ri</i>shi, procured a birth as the san-tsuh (three leg or foot) star <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1622</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Worldly profit is fleeting and perishable, religious (holy) profit is eternal and inexhaustible; a man though a king is full of trouble, a common man, who is holy, has everlasting rest.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1623</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a></p>  
 <p>Buddha knowing the state of the king's heart,--that he rejoiced in religion as <i>S</i>akrarâ<i>g</i>a <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--considered the two obstacles that weighted him, viz. too great love of money, and of external pleasures <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">2</font></a>; 1 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 624</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then seizing the opportunity, and knowing the tendencies of his heart, he began, for the king's sake, to preach: 'Even those who, by evil karman <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">3</font></a>, have been born in low degree, when they see a person of virtuous character, feel reverence for him; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1625</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How much rather ought an independent <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">4</font></a> king, who by his previous conditions of life has acquired much merit, when he encounters Buddha, to conceive even more reverence. Nor is it difficult to understand, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1626</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That a country should enjoy more rest and peace, by the presence of Buddha, than if he were not to dwell therein <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">5</font></a>. And now, as I briefly declare my law, let the Mahârâ<i>g</i>a listen and weigh my words, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1627</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And hold fast that which I deliver! See now the end of my perfected merit <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">6</font></a>', my life is done,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234</font></a></p>  
 <p>there is for me no further body or spirit, but freedom from all ties of kith or kin! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1628</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The good or evil deeds we do from first to last (beginning to end) follow us as shadows; most exalted then the deeds (karman) of the king of the law <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The prince <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">2</font></a> (son) who cherishes his people, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1629</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In the present life gains renown, and hereafter ascends to heaven; but by disobedience and neglect of duty, present distress is felt and future misery! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1630</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As in old times Lui-’ma (lean horse) <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">3</font></a>y râ<i>g</i>a, by obeying the precepts, was born in heaven, whilst Kin-pu (gold step) râ<i>g</i>a, doing wickedly, at the end of life was born in misery. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1631</font></span></p>  
 <p>Now then, for the sake of the great king, I will briefly relate the good and evil law (the law of good and evil). The great requirement <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">4</font></a> is a loving heart! to regard the people as we do an only son, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1632</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not to oppress, not to destroy; to keep in due check every member of the body, to forsake unrighteous doctrine and walk in the straight path; not to exalt oneself by treading down others (or inferiors), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1633</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But to comfort and befriend those in suffering;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p>not to exercise oneself in false theories <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">1</font></a> (treatises), nor to ponder much on kingly dignity (strength), nor to listen to the smooth words of false teachers; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1634</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Not to vex oneself by austerities, not to exceed (or transgress) the right rules of kingly conduct, but to meditate on Buddha and weigh his righteous law, and to put down and adjust all that is contrary to religion; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1635</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To exhibit true superiority by virtuous conduct and the highest exercise of reason, to meditate deeply on the vanity of earthly things, to realise the fickleness of life by constant recollection; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1636</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To exalt the mind to the highest point of reflection, to seek sincere faith (truth) with firm purpose; to retain an inward sense of happiness resulting from oneself <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (and to look forward to) increased happiness hereafter; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1637</font></span></p>  
 <p>'To lay up a good name for distant ages, this will secure the favour of Tathâgata <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">3</font></a>, as men now loving sweet fruit will hereafter be praised by their descendants <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">4</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1638</font></span></p>  
 <p>'There is a way of darkness out of light <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">5</font></a>, there is a way of light out of darkness; there is darkness which follows after the gloom (signs of gloom),</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>  
 <p>there is a light which causes the brightening of light. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1639</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The wise man leaving first principles <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">1</font></a>, should go on to get more light <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">2</font></a>; evil words will be repeated far and wide by the multitude, but there are few to follow good direction; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1640</font></span></p>  
 <p>'It is impossible however to avoid result of works <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the doer cannot escape; if there had been no first works, there had been in the end no result of doing, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1641</font></span></p>  
 <p>'--No reward for good, no hereafter joy--; but because works are done, there is no escape. Let us then practise good works; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1642</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(Let us) inspect our thoughts that we do no evil, because as we sow so we reap <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">4</font></a>. As when enclosed in a four-stone [stone or rock-encircled] mountain, there is no escape or place of refuge for any one, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1643</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So within this mountain-wall of old age, birth, disease, and death, there is no escape for the world <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Only by considering and practising the true law can we escape from this sorrow-piled mountain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1644</font></span></p>  
 <p>'There is, indeed, no constancy in the world, the end of the pleasures of sense is as the lightning flash, whilst old age and death are as the piercing bolts; what profit, then, in doing (practising) iniquity <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">6</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1645</font></span></p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a></p>  
 <p>'All the ancient conquering kings, who were as gods <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">1</font></a> on earth, thought by their strength to overcome decay <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but after a brief life they too disappeared <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1646</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The Kalpa-fire will melt Mount Sumeru, the water of the ocean will be dried up, how much less can our human frame, which is as a bubble, expect to endure for long upon the earth! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1647</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The fierce wind scatters the thick mists, the sun's rays encircle (hide) Mount Sumeru, the fierce fire licks up the place of moisture, so things are ever born once more to be destroyed! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1648</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The body is a thing (vessel) of unreality, kept through the suffering of the long night <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">4</font></a>, pampered by wealth, living idly and in carelessness, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1649</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Death suddenly comes and it is carried away as rotten wood in the stream! The wise man expecting these changes with diligence strives against sloth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1650</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The dread of birth and death acts as a spur to keep him from lagging on the road; he frees himself from engagements, he is not occupied with self-pleasing, he is not entangled by any of the cares of life, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1651</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He holds to no business, seeks no friendships, engages in no learned career, nor yet wholly separates himself from it; for his learning is the wisdom</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>  
 <p>of not-perceiving <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">1</font></a> wisdom, but yet perceiving that which tells him of his own impermanence; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1652</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having a body, yet keeping aloof from defilement, he learns to regard defilement as the greatest evil. (He knows) that tho’ born in the Arûpa world, there is yet no escape from the changes of time; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1653</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His learning, then, is to acquire the changeless body; for where no change is, there is peace. Thus the possession of this changeful body is the foundation of all sorrow. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1654</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Therefore, again, all who are wise make this their aim--to seek a bodiless condition; all the various orders of sentient creatures, from the indulgence of lust, derive pain; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1655</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Therefore all those in this condition ought to conceive a heart, loathing lust; putting away and loathing this condition, then they shall receive no more pain; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1656</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Though born in a state with or without an external form, the certainty of future change is the root of sorrow; for so long as there is no perfect cessation of personal being, there can be, certainly, no absence of personal desire; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1657</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Beholding, in this way, the character of the three worlds, their inconstancy and unreality, the presence of ever-consuming pain, how can the wise man seek enjoyment therein? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1658</font></span></p>  
 <p>'When a tree is burning with fierce flames how</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>can the birds congregate therein? The wise man, who is regarded as an enlightened sage, without this knowledge is ignorant; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1659</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having this knowledge, then true wisdom dawns; without it, there is no enlightenment. To get this wisdom is the one aim, to neglect it is the mistake of life. 1660.</p>  
 <p>'All the teaching of the schools should be centred here; without it is no true reason. To recount this excellent system is not for those who dwell in family connection; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1661</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Nor is it, on that account, not to be said <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for religion concerns a man individually [is a private affair]. Burned up with sorrow, by entering the cool stream, all may obtain relief and ease; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1662</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The light of a lamp in a dark room lights up equally objects of all colours, so is it with those who devote themselves to religion,--there is no distinction between the professed disciple and the unlearned (common). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1663</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Sometimes the mountain-dweller (i.e. the religious hermit) falls into ruin, sometimes the humble householder mounts up to be a <i>Ri</i>shi; the want of faith (doubt) is the engulfing sea, the presence of disorderly belief is the rolling flood, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1664</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The tide of lust carries away the world; involved in its eddies there is no escape; wisdom is the handy boat, reflection is the hold-fast. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1665</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The drum-call of religion (expedients), the barrier (dam) of thought, these alone can rescue from</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p>the sea of ignorance.' At this time the king sincerely attentive to the words of the All-wise <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1666</font></span></p>  
 <p>Conceived a distaste for the world's glitter and was dissatisfied with the pleasures of royalty, even as one avoids a drunken elephant, or returns to right reason after a debauch. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1667</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then all the heretical teachers, seeing that the king was well affected to Buddha, besought the king (mahârâ<i>g</i>a), with one voice, to call on Buddha to exhibit <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">2</font></a> his miraculous gifts. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1668</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the king addressed the lord of the world: 'I pray you, grant their request!' Then Buddha silently acquiesced <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And now all the different professors of religion, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1669</font></span></p>  
 <p>The doctors who boasted of their spiritual power, came together in a body to where Buddha was; then he manifested before them his power of miracle; ascending up into the air, he remained seated, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1670</font></span></p>  
 <p>Diffusing his glory as the light of the sun he shed abroad the brightness of his presence. The heretical teachers were all abashed, the people all were filled with faith. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1671</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then for the sake of preaching to his mother, he forthwith ascended to the heaven of the thirty-three gods; and for three months dwelt in heavenly mansions <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">4</font></a>. There he converted the occupants (Devas) of that abode, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1672</font></span></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a></p>  
 <p>And having concluded his pious mission to his mother, the time of his sojourn in heaven finished, he forthwith returned, the angels accompanying him on wing <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">1</font></a>; he travelled down a seven-gemmed ladder, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1673</font></span></p>  
 <p>And again arrived at <i>G</i>ambudvîpa. Stepping down he alighted on the spot where all the Buddhas return <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">2</font></a>, countless hosts of angels accompanied him, conveying with them their palace abodes (as a gift); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1674</font></span></p>  
 <p>The people of <i>G</i>ambudvîpa with closed hands looking up with reverence, beheld him. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1675</font></span></p>

In plate xiii (Cunningham's Barahut) the Vihâra is represented, the wheel denoting the sermon which Buddha preached; the waving of garments and whistling with fingers denoting the joy of the hearers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_616"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_616">232:1</a> I cannot be sure of this translation; yet I can suggest no other. The line is <a name="img_23200"></a>
 <img src="img/23200.jpg">.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_617"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_617">232:2</a> 'The victorious stream;' this may refer to the Rapti, on the banks of which <i>S</i>râvastî was situated. The object of the allusion is that as both rich and poor, noble and ignoble may enter the stream of the river, so all may seek the benefit of the stream of religious doctrine.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_618"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_618">232:3</a> I am unable to explain the reference here; nor do I know what the 'three-footed star' can be.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_619"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_619">233:1</a> General Cunningham (Barahut Stûpa, plate xiii) has remarked that the Preaching Hall visited by Prasena<i>g</i>it resembles in detail the Palace of <i>S</i>akrarâ<i>g</i>a; the reference in the text seems to allude to this.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_620"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_620">233:2</a> Reference is often made in Buddhist books to the self-indulgence of king Prasena<i>g</i>it. Compare section xxix of the Chinese Dhammapada.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_621"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_621">233:3</a> That is, in consequence of evil deeds.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_622"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_622">233:4</a> This expression 'tsze tsai,' which I render 'independent,' means 'self-sufficient,' or 'self-existing;' the reference is probably to a lord paramount (samrâ<i>g</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_623"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_623">233:5</a> This exordium appears intended to take down the pride of the king.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_624"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_624">233:6</a> Buddha points to himself as having gained the end of all his <a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234</font></a> previous meritorious conduct, in the attainment of his present condition.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_625"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_625">234:1</a> Dharmarâ<i>g</i>a, an epithet of every Buddha (Eitel).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_626"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_626">234:2</a> The symbol here stands for 'son;' it may mean 'prince' in the sense of 'son of the king of the law' (fă wang tseu), which is a common one in Buddhist books, and is often rendered by 'Kumâra bhûta.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_627"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_627">234:3</a> Lui-’ma may be a phonetic equivalent of the name of the king, or a translation of the name, viz. K<i>ri</i><i>s</i>âsva. So also in the next line Hira<i>n</i>yaka<i>s</i>ipu may be meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_628"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_628">234:4</a> The 'great deficiency,' or 'the great need.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_629"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_629">235:1</a> In false theories and 'vidyâs' (ming).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_630"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_630">235:2</a> Self-dependent happiness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_631"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_631">235:3</a> Whether the phrase '<i>g</i>u-lai' ought to be here translated Tathâgata, or whether it refers simply to 'future generations,' is a question.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_632"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_632">235:4</a> This again is an uncertain translation, although the meaning is plain, that those who here love 'sweet fruit,' will not set their children's teeth on edge hereafter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_633"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_633">235:5</a> In this and the following lines the reference is apparently to the possibility of growing worse or better by our deeds.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_634"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_634">236:1</a> San p’hin, the 'three sections.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_635"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_635">236:2</a> Ought to learn from first to last, illumination.' Does it refer to books or vidyâs (ming) of instruction?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_636"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_636">236:3</a> There is not such a thing as 'not making fruit,' or the fruit of 'not making;' but the former is the more likely. 'Fruit,' of course, refers to the result of works.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_637"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_637">236:4</a> 'Because as we ourselves do, we ourselves receive.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_638"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_638">236:5</a> For all living creatures.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_639"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_639">236:6</a> 'Why then ought we to do iniquity!' (fi fă.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_640"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_640">237:1</a> Who were as Î<i>s</i>varadeva.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_641"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_641">237:2</a> Literally, 'to conquer emptiness;' it may mean to 'surpass the sky '--to climb to heaven.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_642"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_642">237:3</a> They were ground to dust and disappeared.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_643"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_643">237:4</a> The suffering of the 'long night' (the period of constant transmigration) keeps and guards it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_644"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_644">238:1</a> 'The wisdom of not perceiving;' the symbol 'sheu' corresponds with 'vedanâ,' perception, or sensation. The meaning therefore is that true wisdom depends not on the power of sense; but yet he perceives by his senses that he (his body) is impermanent.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_645"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_645">239:1</a> This and the preceding line are obscure. The sense of the whole passage seems to point to the adaptation of religion for the life of all persons, laïc or cleric.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_646"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_646">240:1</a> The words of him who knew all things.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_647"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_647">240:2</a> To substantiate his claim by exhibiting miraculous power.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_648"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_648">240:3</a> By his silence showed his acquiescence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_649"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_649">240:4</a> There is an account of Buddha's ascent to this heaven in the Manual of Buddhism, pp. 298 seq. Also in Fă-hien, cap. xvii. There are pictures (sculptures) of the scene of his descent in Tree and Serpent Worship, plate xvii, and in the account of the Stûpa of Barahut.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_650"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_650">241:1</a> It would be curious, if this translation were absolutely certain, to find that A<i>s</i>vaghosha had heard of angels with 'wings.' In the sculptures the Devas are represented as ordinary mortals. The Chinese may, however, simply mean 'accompanying him, as if on wing,' i.e. following him through the air.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_651"></a><a href="sbe1922.htm#fr_651">241:2</a> That is, at Sankisa (Sâṅkâ<i>s</i>ya), [see the Archæological Survey of India, 1862-1863.]</p>
