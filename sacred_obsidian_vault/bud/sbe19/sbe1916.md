   <h3 align="center">VARGA 14. O-WEI-SAN-POU-TI (ABHISAMBODHI) <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>Bodhisattva having subdued Mâra, his firmly fixed mind at rest, thoroughly exhausting the first principle of truth <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he entered into deep and subtle contemplation, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1111</font></span></p>  
 <p>Self-contained. Every kind of Sâmadhi in order passed before his eyes. During the first watch he entered on 'right perception <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">3</font></a>,' and in recollection all former births passed before his eyes; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1112</font></span></p>  
 <p>Born in such a place, of such a name, and downwards to his present birth, so through hundreds, thousands, myriads, all his births and deaths he knew; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1113</font></span></p>  
 <p>Countless in number were they, of every kind and sort; then knowing, too, his family relationships, great pity rose within his heart. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1114</font></span></p>  
 <p>This sense of deep compassion passed, he once again considered 'all that lives,' and how they moved within the six <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">4</font></a> portions of life's revolution, no final term to birth and death; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1115</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>  
 <p>Hollow all, and false and transient (unfixed) as the plantain tree, or as a dream, or phantasy. Then in the middle watch of night, he reached to knowledge (eyes) of the pure Devas <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1116</font></span></p>  
 <p>And beheld before him every creature, as one sees images upon a mirror; all creatures born and born again to die, noble and mean, the poor and rich, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1117</font></span></p>  
 <p>Reaping the fruit of right or evil doing, and sharing happiness or misery in consequence. First he considered and distinguished evil-doers (works), that such must ever reap an evil birth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1118</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then he considered those who practise righteous deeds, that these must gain a place with men or gods; but those again born in the nether hells, (he saw) participating in every kind of misery; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1119</font></span></p>  
 <p>Swallowing (drinking) molten brass (metal), the iron skewers piercing their bodies, confined within the boiling caldron, driven and made to enter the fiery oven (dwelling), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1120</font></span></p>  
 <p>Food for hungry, long-toothed dogs, or preyed upon by brain-devouring birds; dismayed by fire, then (they wander through) thick woods, with leaves like razors gashing their limbs, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1121</font></span></p>  
 <p>While knives divide their (writhing) bodies, or hatchets lop their members, bit by bit; drinking the bitterest poisons, their fate yet holds them back from death. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1122</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus those who found their joy in evil deeds, he saw receiving now their direst sorrow; a momentary taste of pleasure here, a dreary length of suffering there; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1123</font></span></p>  
 <p>A laugh or joke because of others' pain, a crying</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>out and weeping now at punishment received. Surely if living creatures saw the consequence of all their evils deeds, self-visited, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1124</font></span></p>  
 <p>With hatred would they turn and leave them, fearing the ruin following--the blood and death. He saw, moreover, all the fruits of birth as beasts, each deed entailing its own return, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1125</font></span></p>  
 <p>(And) when death ensues born in some other form (beast shape), different in kind according to the deeds. Some doomed to die for the sake of skin or flesh <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">1</font></a>, some for their horns or hair or bones or wings, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1126</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others torn or killed in mutual conflict, friend or relative before, contending thus; (some) burthened with loads or dragging heavy weights, (others) pierced and urged on by pricking goads, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1127</font></span></p>  
 <p>Blood flowing down their tortured forms, parched and hungry--no relief afforded; then, turning round, (he saw) one with the other struggling, possessed of no independent strength; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1128</font></span></p>  
 <p>Flying through air or sunk in deep water, yet no place as a refuge left from death. He saw, moreover, those, misers and covetous, born now as hungry ghosts, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1129</font></span></p>  
 <p>Vast bodies like the towering mountain, with mouths as small as any needle-tube, hungry and thirsty, nought but fire and poison’d flame to enwrap their burning forms within. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1130</font></span></p>  
 <p>Covetous, they would not give to those who sought, or duped the man who gave in charity, now born among the famished ghosts, they seek for food, but cannot find withal. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1131</font></span></p>  
 <p>The refuse of the unclean man they fain would</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>eat, but this is changed and lost (before it can be eaten); oh! if a man believes that covetousness is thus repaid, as in their case, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1132</font></span></p>  
 <p>Would he not give his very flesh in charity even as <i>S</i>ivi râ<i>g</i>a did! Then, once more (he saw), those reborn as men, with bodies like some foul sewer, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1133</font></span></p>  
 <p>Ever moving ’midst the direst sufferings, born from the womb to fear and trembling, with body tender, touching anything its feelings painful, as if cut with knives; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1134</font></span></p>  
 <p>Whilst born in this condition, no moment free from chance of death, labour, and sorrow, yet seeking birth again, and being born again, enduring pain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1135</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then (he saw those who) by a higher merit were enjoying heaven; a thirst for love ever consuming them, their merit ended with the end of life, the five signs <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">1</font></a> warning them of death (their beauty fades), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1136</font></span></p>  
 <p>Just as the blossom that decays, withering away, is robbed of all its shining tints; not all their associates, living still, though grieving, can avail to save the rest; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1137</font></span></p>  
 <p>The palaces and joyous precincts empty now, the Devîs all alone and desolate, sitting or asleep upon the dusty earth, weep bitterly in recollection of their loves; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1138</font></span></p>  
 <p>Those who are born, sad in decay; those who are dead, belovéd, cause of grief; thus ever struggling on, preparing future pain, covetous they seek the joys of heaven, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1139</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>Obtaining which, these sorrows come apace; despicable joys! oh, who would covet them! using such mighty efforts (means) to obtain, and yet unable thence to banish pain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1140</font></span></p>  
 <p>Alas, alas! these Devas, too, alike deceived--no difference is there! thro’ lapse of ages bearing suffering, striving to crush desire and lust, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1141</font></span></p>  
 <p>Now certainly expecting long reprieve, and yet once more destined to fall! in hell enduring every kind of pain, as beasts tearing and killing one the other, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1142</font></span></p>  
 <p>As Pretas parched with direst thirst, as men worn out, seeking enjoyment; although, they say, when born in heaven, 'then we shall escape these greater ills,' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1143</font></span></p>  
 <p>Deceived, alas! no single place exempt, in every birth incessant pain! Alas! the sea of birth and death revolving thus--an ever-whirling wheel--1144</p>  
 <p>All flesh immersed within its waves cast here and there without reliance! thus with his pure Deva eyes he thoughtfully considered the five domains of life. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1145</font></span></p>  
 <p>He saw that all was empty and vain alike! with no dependence! like the plantain or the bubble. Then, on the third eventful watch, he entered on the deep, true <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">1</font></a> apprehension <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">2</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1146</font></span></p>  
 <p>He meditated on the entire world of creatures, whirling in life's tangle, born <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">3</font></a> to sorrow; the crowds who live, grow old, and die, innumerable for multitude, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1147</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>Covetous, lustful, ignorant, darkly-fettered, with no way known for final rescue. Rightly considering, inwardly he reflected from what source birth and death proceed; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1148</font></span></p>  
 <p>He was assured that age and death must come from birth as from a source. For since a man has born with him a body, that body must inherit pain (disease). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1149</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then looking further whence comes birth, he saw it came from life-deeds done elsewhere; then with his Deva-eyes scanning these deeds, he saw they were not framed by I<i>s</i>vara; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1150</font></span></p>  
 <p>They were not self-caused, they were not personal existences, nor were they either uncaused; then, as one who breaks the first bamboo joint finds all the rest easy to separate, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1151</font></span></p>  
 <p>Having discerned the cause of birth and death, he gradually came to see the truth; deeds come from upâdâna (cleaving), like as fire which catches hold of grass; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1152</font></span></p>  
 <p>Upâdâna (tsu) comes from t<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â (’ngai), just as a little fire enflames the mountains; t<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â comes from vedanâ (shau), (the perception of pain and pleasure, the desire for rest); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1153</font></span></p>  
 <p>As the starving or the thirsty man seeks food and drink, so 'sensation' (perception) brings 'desire' for life; then contact (spar<i>s</i>a) is the cause of all sensation, producing the three kinds of pain or pleasure, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1154</font></span></p>  
 <p>Even as by art of man the rubbing wood produces fire for any use or purpose; spar<i>s</i>a (contact) is born from the six entrances (âyatanas) <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p>(a man is blind because he cannot see the light) <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1155</font></span></p>  
 <p>The six entrances are caused by name and thing, just as the germ grows to the stem and leaf; name and thing are born from knowledge (vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ana), as the seed which germinates and brings forth leaves. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1156</font></span></p>  
 <p>Knowledge, in turn, proceeds from name and thing, the two are intervolved leaving no remnant; by some concurrent cause knowledge engenders name and thing, whilst by some other cause concurrent, name and thing engender knowledge; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1157</font></span></p>  
 <p>Just as a man and ship advance together, the water and the land mutually involved <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">2</font></a>; thus knowledge brings forth name and thing; name and thing produce the roots (âyatanas); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1158</font></span></p>  
 <p>The roots engender contact; contact again brings forth sensation; sensation brings forth longing desire; longing desire produces upâdâna; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1159</font></span></p>  
 <p>Upâdâna is the cause of deeds; and these again engender birth; birth again produces age and death; so does this one incessant round <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1160</font></span></p>  
 <p>Cause the existence of all living things. Rightly illumined, thoroughly perceiving this, firmly established, thus was he enlightened; destroy birth, old age and death will cease; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1161</font></span></p>  
 <p>Destroy bhava then will birth cease; destroy 'cleaving' (upâdâna) then will bhava end; destroy t<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â (desire) then will cleaving end; destroy sensation then will t<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â end; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1162</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>Destroy contact then will end sensation; destroy the six entrances, then will contact cease; the six entrances all destroyed, from this, moreover, names and things will cease; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1163</font></span></p>  
 <p>Knowledge destroyed, names and things <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">1</font></a> will cease; sa<i>m</i>skâra (names and, things) destroyed, then knowledge perishes; ignorance destroyed, then the sa<i>m</i>skâra <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">2</font></a> will die; the great <i>Ri</i>shi was thus perfected in wisdom (sambodhi). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1164</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus perfected, Buddha then devised for the world's benefit the eightfold path, right sight, and so on, the only true path for the world to tread. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1165</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus did he complete the end (destruction) of 'self,' as fire goes out for want of grass; thus he had done what he would have men do; he first had found the way of perfect knowledge; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1166</font></span></p>  
 <p>He finished thus the first great lesson (paramârtha); entering the great <i>Ri</i>shi's house <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the darkness disappeared; light coming on, perfectly silent, all at rest, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1167</font></span></p>  
 <p>He reached at last the exhaustless source of truth (dharma); lustrous with all wisdom the great <i>Ri</i>shi sat, perfect in gifts, whilst one convulsive throe shook the wide earth. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1168</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the world was calm again and bright, when Devas, Nâgas, spirits, all assembled, amidst the void raise heavenly music, and make their offerings as the law <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">4</font></a> directs; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1169</font></span></p>  
 <p>A gentle cooling breeze sprang up around, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>from the sky a fragrant rain distilled; exquisite flowers, not seasonable <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">1</font></a>, bloomed; sweet fruits before their time were ripened; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1170</font></span></p>  
 <p>Great Mandâras <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and every sort of heavenly precious flower, from space in rich confusion fell, as tribute <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">3</font></a> to the illustrious monk. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1171</font></span></p>  
 <p>Creatures of every different kind were moved one towards the other lovingly; fear and terror altogether put away, none entertained a hateful thought; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1172</font></span></p>  
 <p>And all things living in the world with faultless men <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">4</font></a> consorted freely; the Devas giving up their heavenly joys, sought rather to alleviate the sinner's sufferings; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1173</font></span></p>  
 <p>Pain and distress grew less and less, the moon of wisdom waxed apace; whilst all the <i>Ri</i>shis of the Ikshvâku clan who had received a heavenly birth, 1174.</p>  
 <p>Beholding Buddha thus benefitting men, were filled with joy and satisfaction; and whilst throughout the heavenly mansions religious offerings fell as raining flowers, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1175</font></span></p>  
 <p>The Devas and the Nâga spirits <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">5</font></a>, with one voice, praised the Buddha's virtues; men seeing the religious offerings, hearing, too, the joyous hymn of praise, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1176</font></span></p>  
 <p>Were all rejoiced in turn; they leapt for unrestrained</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p>joy; Mâra, the Devarâ<i>g</i>a, only, felt in his heart great anguish. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1177</font></span></p>  
 <p>Buddha for those seven days, in contemplation lost, his heart at peace, beheld and pondered on the Bodhi tree, with gaze unmoved and never wearying: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1178</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now resting here, in this condition, I have obtained,' he said, 'my ever-shifting <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">1</font></a>heart's desire, and now at rest I stand, escaped from self <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' The eyes of Buddha <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">3</font></a> then considered 'all that lives,' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1179</font></span></p>  
 <p>And forthwith rose there in him deep compassion; much he desired to bring about their welfare (purity), but how to gain for them that most excellent deliverance, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1180</font></span></p>  
 <p>From covetous desire, hatred, ignorance, and false. teaching (this was the question); how to suppress this sinful heart by right direction; not by anxious use . of outward means, but by resting quietly in thoughtful silence. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1181</font></span></p>  
 <p>Now looking back and thinking of his mighty vow, there rose once more within his mind a wish to preach the law; and looking carefully throughout the world, he saw how pain and sorrow ripened and increased everywhere. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1182</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then Brahma-deva knowing his thoughts, and considering <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">4</font></a> it right to request him to advance religion for the wider spread of the Brahma-glory, in the deliverance of all flesh from sorrow, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1183</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>  
 <p>Coming, beheld upon the person of the reverend monk all the distinguishing marks of a great preacher, visible in an excellent degree; fixed and unmoved (he sat) in the possession of truth and wisdom, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1184</font></span></p>  
 <p>Free from all evil impediments, with a heart cleansed from all insincerity or falsehood. Then with reverent and a joyful heart, (great Brahma stood and) with hands joined, thus made known his request: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1185</font></span></p>  
 <p>'What happiness in all the world so great as when a loving master meets the unwise <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">1</font></a>; the world with all its occupants, filled with impurity and dire confusion <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1186</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With heavy grief oppressed, or, in some cases, lighter sorrows, (waits deliverance); the lord of men, having escaped by crossing the wide and mournful sea of birth and death, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1187</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We now entreat to rescue others--those struggling creatures all engulphed therein; as the just worldly man, when he gets profit, gives some rebate withal <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1188</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So the lord of men enjoying such religious gain, should <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">4</font></a> also give somewhat to living things. The world indeed is bent on large personal gain, and hard it is to share one's own with others; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1189</font></span></p>  
 <p>'O! let your loving heart be moved with pity towards the world burthened <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">5</font></a> with vexing cares.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Thus having spoken by way of exhortation, with reverent mien he turned back to the Brahma heaven. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1190</font></span></p>  
 <p>Buddha regarding the invitation of Brahma-deva rejoiced at heart, and his design was strengthened; greatly was his heart of pity nourished, and purposed was his mind to preach. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1191</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thinking he ought to beg some food, each of the four kings offered him a Pâtra; Tathâgata <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">1</font></a>, in fealty to religion, received the four and joined them all in one. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1192</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now some merchant men were passing by, to whom 'a virtuous friend <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' a heavenly spirit, said: 'The great <i>Ri</i>shi, the venerable monk, is dwelling in this mountain grove, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1193</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(Affording) in the world a noble field for merit <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_435"><font size="1">3</font></a>; go then and offer him a sacrifice!' Hearing the summons, joyfully they went, and offered the first meal religiously. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1194</font></span></p>  
 <p>Having partaken of it, then he deeply pondered, who first should hear the law <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">4</font></a>; he thought at once of Arâ<i>d</i>a Kâlâma and Udraka Râmaputra, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1195</font></span></p>

 <p>As being fit to accept the righteous law; but now they both were dead. Then next he thought of the five men, that they were fit to hear the first sermon. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1196</font></span></p>  
 <p>Bent then on this design to preach Nirvâ<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">1</font></a>, as the sun's glory bursts thro’ the darkness, so went he on towards Benares, the place where dwelt the ancient <i>Ri</i>shis; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1197</font></span></p>  
 <p>With eyes as gentle as the ox king's, his pace as firm and even as the lion's, because he would convert the world he went on towards the Kâ<i>s</i>i <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">2</font></a> city; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1198</font></span></p>  
 <p>Step by step, like the king of beasts, did he advance watchfully through the grove of wisdom (Uruvilva wood). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1199</font></span></p>
