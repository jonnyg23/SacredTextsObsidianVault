 <p>At this time there was a Devaputra, riding on (or in) his thousand <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">1</font></a> white-swan palace <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the midst of space, who beheld the Parinirvâ<i>n</i>a of Buddha. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2115</font></span></p>  
 <p>This one, for the universal benefit of the Deva assembly, sounded forth at large these verses (gâthas) on impermanence: 'Impermanency is the nature of all (things), quickly born, they quickly die. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2116</font></span></p>  
 <p>'With birth there comes the rush <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">3</font></a> of sorrows, only in Nirvâ<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">4</font></a> is there joy. The accumulated fuel heaped up by the power of karman <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">5</font></a> (deeds), this the fire of wisdom alone can consume. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2117</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Though the fame (of our deeds <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">6</font></a>) reach up to heaven as smoke, yet in time the rains which descend will extinguish all, as the fire that rages at the kalpa's end is put out by the judgment <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">7</font></a> (calamity) of water.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2118</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>Again there was a Brahma-<i>Ri</i>shi-deva, like a most exalted <i>Ri</i>shi (a highest-principle <i>Ri</i>shi <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">1</font></a>), dwelling in heaven, possessed of superior happiness, with no taint in his bliss (heavenly inheritance), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2119</font></span></p>  
 <p>Who thus sighed forth his praises of Tathâgata's Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, with his mind fixed in abstraction as he spoke: 'Looking through all the conditions of life (of the three worlds), from first to last nought is free from destruction. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2120</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But the incomparable seer dwelling in the world, thoroughly acquainted with the highest truth <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whose wisdom grasps that which is beyond the (world's) ken <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he it is who can save the worldly-dwellers <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">4</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2121</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He it is who can provide lasting escape (preservation) from the destructive power of impermanence. But, alas! through the wide world, all that lives is sunk in unbelief (heretical teaching).' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2122</font></span></p>  
 <p>At this time Anuruddha, 'not stopped' (ruddha) <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">5</font></a> by the world, 'not stopped' from being delivered</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>(delivered and not stopped), the stream of birth and death for ever 'stopped <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">1</font></a>' (niruddha), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2123</font></span></p>  
 <p>Sighed forth the praises of Tathâgata's Nirvâ<i>n</i>a: 'All living things completely blind and dark <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">2</font></a>! the mass of deeds (sa<i>m</i>skâra) all perishing (inconstant), even as the fleeting cloud-pile <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">3</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2124</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Quickly arising and as quickly perishing! the wise man holds not to such a refuge, for the diamond mace of inconstancy. can (even) overturn the mountain of the <i>Ri</i>shi hermit <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">4</font></a> (muni). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2125</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How despicable and how weak the world! doomed to destruction, without strength! Impermanence, like the fierce lion, can even spoil the Nâga-elephant-great-<i>Ri</i>shi <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">5</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2126</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Only the diamond curtain of Tathâgata can overwhelm <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">6</font></a> inconstancy! How much more should those not yet delivered from desire (passion), fear and dread its power. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2127</font></span></p>  
 <p>'From the six seeds there grows one sprout <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">7</font></a>, one kind of water from the rain, the origin of the</p>

 <p>four points <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">1</font></a> is far removed, five kinds of fruit from the two "koo <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">2</font></a>;" <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2128</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The three periods (past, present, future) are but one in substance; the Muni-great-elephant plucks up the great tree of sorrow, and yet he (even he) cannot avoid the power of impermanence. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2129</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For like the crested <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">3</font></a> (<i>s</i>ikhin) bird delights (within) the pool (water) to seize the poisonous snake, but when from sudden drought he is left in the dry pool, he dies; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2130</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Or as the prancing steed advances fearlessly to battle, but when the fight has passed goes back subdued and quiet; or as the raging fire burns with the fuel, but when the fuel is done, expires; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2131</font></span></p>  
 <p>'So is it with Tathâgata, his task accomplished he returns <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">4</font></a> to (find his refuge in) Nirvâ<i>n</i>a: just as the shining of the radiant moon sheds everywhere its light and drives away the gloom, 2132.</p>  
 <p>'All creatures grateful for its light, (then suddenly) it disappears concealed by Sumeru; such is the case with Tathâgata, the brightness of his wisdom lit up the gloomy darkness, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2133</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And for the good of all that lives drove it away, when suddenly it disappears behind the mountain of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. The splendour of his fame throughout the world diffused, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2134</font></span></p>

 <p>'Had banished all obscurity, but like the stream that ever flows, it rests not with us the illustrious charioteer with his seven prancing steeds <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">1</font></a> flies through the host (and disappears); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2135</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The bright-rayed <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">2</font></a> Sûrya-deva, entering the Yen-tsz’ <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">3</font></a> cave, was, with the moon, surrounded with fivefold barriers; "all things that live," deprived of light, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2136</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Present their offerings to heaven; but from their sacrifice nought but the blacken’d smoke ascends <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">4</font></a>; thus is it with Tathâgata, his glory hidden, the world has lost its light. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2137</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Rare was the expectancy of grateful love <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">5</font></a> that filled the heart of all that lives; that love, reached its full limit, then was left to perish! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2138</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The cords of sorrow all removed, we found the true and only way; but now he leaves the tangled mesh of life, and enters on the quiet place! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2139</font></span></p>

 <p>'The earthy soil of sorrow's dust his wisdom's water purifies! no more, no more, returns he here! for ever gone to the place of rest! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2141</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(The power of) birth and death destroyed, the world (all things) instructed in the highest doctrine! he bids the world rejoice in (knowledge of) his law, and gives to all the benefit of wisdom! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2142</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Giving complete rest to the world, the virtuous streams <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">1</font></a> flow forth! his fame known (spread) throughout the world, shines still with increased splendour! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2143</font></span></p>  
 <p>'How great his pity and his love to those who opposed his claims, neither rejoicing in their defeat nor exulting in his own success <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2144</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Illustriously controlling his feelings, all his senses completely enlightened, his heart impartially observing events, unpolluted by the six objects (or, fields) of sense! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2145</font></span></p>

 <p>'All living things rejoicing in religion, fully satisfied <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">1</font></a>! obtaining all they need (seek), their every wish (vow) fulfilled! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2149</font></span></p>

 <p>'Concealing <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">5</font></a> the one (himself) and obtaining the one (saintship)--leaping over the seven (bodhyaṅgas?) and (obtaining) the long sleep; the end of all, the quiet, peaceful way; the highest prize of sages and of saints! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2152</font></span></p>

 <p>'Planting a sacred seed (seed of holiness) in the hearts of those practising virtue (worldly virtue <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">1</font></a>) impartially directing and not casting off those who are right or not right (in their views)! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2155</font></span></p>

 <p>'All those practising a false method (heretical) of religion, delivering to them deep principles (of his religion)! preaching the doctrines of birth and death and impermanency; (declaring that) without a master <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">3</font></a> (teacher) there can be no happiness! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2158</font></span></p>

 <p>pleasure or pain, caring not for life, desiring only rest (Nirvâ<i>n</i>a)! 2159.</p>  
 <p>'Causing those not yet converted to obtain conversion! those not yet saved to be saved! those not yet at rest to find rest! those not yet enlightened to be enlightened! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2160</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(Thus) the Muni (taught) the way of rest for the direction of all living things! alas! that any transgressing the way of holiness should practise impure (not right) works. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2161</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Even as at the end of the great kalpa, those holding the law who die (or, are dead <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">1</font></a>), (when) the rolling sound of the mysterious thunder-cloud severs the forests, upon these there shall fall the rain of sweet dew (immortality). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2162</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The little elephant breaks down the prickly forest, and by cherishing it we know that it can profit men <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but the cloud that removes the sorrow of the elephant old-age <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">3</font></a>, this none can bear <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2163</font></span></p>

 <p>'And now he enters the great quiet (place)! no longer has the world a protector or saviour! the great army host of Mâra-râ<i>g</i>a, rousing their warrior (spirits), shaking the great earth, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2165</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Desired to injure the honour’d Muni! but they could not move him, whom in a moment now the Mâra "inconstancy" destroys. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2166</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The heavenly occupants (Devas) everywhere assemble as a cloud! they fill the space of heaven, fearing the endless (mastery of) birth and death! their hearts are full of (give birth to) grief and dread! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2167</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His Deva eyes clearly behold, without the limitations of near or distant, the fruits of works discerned throughout, as an image perceived in a mirror! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2168</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His Deva ears perfect and discriminating throughout, hear all, though far away (not near), mounting through space he teaches all the Devas, surpassing his method (limit) of converting men! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2169</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He divides his body still one in substance, crosses the water as if it were not weak (to bear) <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">1</font></a>! remembers all his former births, through countless kalpas none forgotten! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2170</font></span></p>

 <p>'His senses (roots) wandering through the fields . of sense (limits) <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">1</font></a>, all these distinctly remembered; knowing the wisdom learned in every (state of) mind, all this perfectly understood! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2171</font></span></p>  
 <p>'By spiritual discernment and pure mysterious wisdom equally (impartially) surveying all (things)! every vestige of imperfection (leak) removed! thus he has accomplished all (he had to do). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2172</font></span></p>  
 <p>'By wisdom rejecting other spheres of life, his wisdom now completely perfected, to! he dies! let the world, hard and unyielding, still, beholding it, relent! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2173</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All living things though blunt in sense, beholding him, receive the enlightenment of wisdom! their endless evil deeds long past, as they behold, are cancelled and completely cleansed! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2174</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In a moment gone! who shall again exhibit qualities like his? no saviour now in all the world--our hope cut off, our very breath (life) is stopped and gone! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2175</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Who now shall give us life again with the cool water (of his doctrine)? his own great work accomplished, his great compassion now has ceased to work for long (has long ceased or stopped)! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2176</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The world ensnared in the toils of folly, who shall destroy the net? who shall, by his teaching, cause the stream of birth and death to turn again? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2177</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Who shall declare the way of rest (to instruct)</p>

 <p>the heart of all that lives, deceived by ignorance? Who will point out the quiet place, or who make known the one true doctrine (system of doctrine)? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2178</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All flesh suffering (receiving) great sorrow, who shall deliver, like a loving father? Like the horse changing his master loses all gracefulness, as he forgets his many words of guidance (so are we)! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2179</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As a king without a kingdom, such is the world without a Buddha! as a disciple (a <i>S</i>râvaka, a "much hearer") with no power of dialectic (distinguishing powers) left, or like a physician without wisdom, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2180</font></span></p>  
 <p>'As men whose king has lost the marks of royalty (bright or glorious marks), so, Buddha dead, the world has lost its glory! the gentle horses left without a charioteer, the boat without a pilot left! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2181</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The three divisions <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">1</font></a> of an army left without a general! the merchantmen without a guide! the suffering and diseased without a physician! a holy king (<i>k</i>akravartin) without his seven insignia (jewels, ratnâni)! 218 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The stars without the moon! the loving years (the planet Jupiter?) without the power of life!--such is the world now that Buddha, the great teacher, dies!' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2183</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus (spake) the Arhat <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">2</font></a>, all done that should be done, all imperfections quite removed, knowing the meed of gratitude, he was grateful therefore (spake gratefully of his master); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2184</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus thinking of his master's love he spake!</p>

 <p>setting forth the world's great sorrow; whilst those, not yet freed from the power of passion, wept with many tears, unable to control themselves. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2185</font></span></p>  
 <p>Yet even those who had put away all faults, sighed as they thought of the pain of birth and death. And now the Malla host <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">1</font></a> hearing that Buddha had attained Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2186</font></span></p>  
 <p>With cries confused, wept piteously, greatly moved, as when a flight of herons meet a hawk (kite). In a body now they reach the twin (<i>S</i>âla) trees, and as they gaze upon Tathâgata dead (entered on his long sleep), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2187</font></span></p>  
 <p>Those features never again to awake to consciousness, they smote their breasts and sighed to heaven; as when a lion seizing, on a calf, the whole herd rushes on with mingled sounds. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2188</font></span></p>  
 <p>In the midst there was one Malla, his mind enamoured of the righteous law, who gazed with steadfastness upon the holy <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">2</font></a> law-king, now entered on the mighty calm, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2189</font></span></p>  
 <p>And said: 'The world was everywhere asleep, when Buddha setting forth his law caused it to awake; but now he has entered on the mighty calm, and all is finished in an unending sleep. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2190</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For man's sake he had raised the standard of his law, and now, in a moment, it has fallen; the sun of Tathâgata's wisdom spreading abroad the lustre of its "great awakening <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">3</font></a>," <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2191</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Increasing ever more and more in glory, spreading abroad the thousand rays of highest knowledge, scattering and destroying all the gloom (of earth), why has the darkness great come back again? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2192</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His unequalled wisdom lightening the three worlds, giving eyes that all the world might see, now suddenly (the world is) blind again, bewildered, ignorant of the way; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2193</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In a moment fallen the bridge of truth (that spanned) the rolling stream of birth and death, the swelling flood of lust and rage and doubt, and all flesh overwhelmed therein, for ever lost.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2194</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus all that Malla host wept piteously and lamented; whilst some concealed their grief nor spoke a word; others sank prostrate on the earth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2195</font></span></p>  
 <p>Others stood silent, lost in meditation; others, with sorrowful heart, groaned deeply. Then on a gold and silver gem-decked couch <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">1</font></a>, richly adorned with flowers and scents, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2196</font></span></p>  
 <p>They placed the body of Tathâgata; a jewelled canopy they raised above, and round it flags and streamers and embroidered banners; then using every kind of dance and music <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2197</font></span></p>  
 <p>The lords and ladies of the Mallas followed</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a></p>  
 <p>along the road presenting offerings, whilst all the Devas scattered scents and flowers, and raised the sound of drums and music in the heavens. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2198</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus men and Devas shared one common sorrow, their cries united as they grieved together. Entering the city, there the men and women, old and young, completed their religious offerings. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2199</font></span></p>  
 <p>Leaving the city, then, and passing through the Lung-tsiang gate <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and crossing over the Hira<i>n</i>yavatî river, they repaired to where the former Buddhas having died, had <i>K</i>aityas raised to them <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2200</font></span></p>  
 <p>There collecting ox-head sandal wood and every famous scented wood, they placed the whole above the Buddha's body, pouring various scented oils upon the pyre; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2201</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then placing fire beneath to kindle it, three times they walked around; but yet it burned not. At this time the great Kâ<i>s</i>yapa had taken his abode at Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2202</font></span></p>  
 <p>And knowing Buddha was about to die was coming thence with all his followers; his pure mind, deeply moved, desired to see the body of the lord; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2203</font></span></p>  
 <p>And so, because of that his sincere wish, the fire went out and would not kindle. Then Kâ<i>s</i>yapa and his followers coming, with piteous sighs looked on the sight <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2204</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a></p>  
 <p>And reverenced at the master's feet; and then, forthwith, the fire burst out. Quenched the fire of grief within; without, the fire has little power to burn. 2205 '</p>  
 <p>Or though it burn the outside skin and flesh, the diamond true-bone still remains. The scented oil consumed, the fire declines, the bones they place within a golden pitcher; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2206</font></span></p>  
 <p>For as the mystic world <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">1</font></a> (dharma-dhâtu) is not destroyed, neither can these, the bones (of Buddha), perish; the consequence (fruit) of diamond <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">2</font></a> wisdom, difficult to move as Sumeru. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2207</font></span></p>  
 <p>The relics which the mighty golden-pinioned bird cannot remove or change, they place within the precious vase; to remain until the world shall pass away; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2208</font></span></p>  
 <p>And wonderful! the power of men (the world) can thus fulfil Nirvâ<i>n</i>a's laws, the illustrious name of one far spread, is sounded thus throughout the universe; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2209</font></span></p>  
 <p>And as the ages roll, the long Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, by these, the sacred relics (bones), sheds through the world its glorious light, and brightens up the abodes of life. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2210</font></span></p>  
 <p>He perished (quenched his splendour) in a moment! but these relics, placed within the vase, the imperishable signs of wisdom, can overturn the mount of sorrow; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2211</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>The body of accumulated griefs <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">1</font></a> this imperishable mind (ki) can cause to rest, and banish once for ever all the miseries of life. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2212</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus the diamond substance (body) was dealt with at the place of burning. And now those valiant Mallas, unrivalled in the world for strength, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2213</font></span></p>  
 <p>Subduing all private animosities, sought escape from sorrow in the true refuge. Finding sweet comfort in united love, they resolved to banish every complaining thought. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2214</font></span></p>  
 <p>Beholding thus the death of Tathâgata, they controlled their grieving hearts, and with full strength of manly virtue dismissing every listless thought, they submitted to the course (laws) of nature. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2215</font></span></p>  
 <p>Oppressed by thoughts of grievous sorrow, they entered the city as a deserted wild, holding the relics thus they entered, whilst from every street were offered gifts. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2216</font></span></p>  
 <p>They placed the relics then upon a tower <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for men and Devas to adore. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 2217</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="fn_829"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_829">309:1</a> The symbol for 'thousand' is probably an error for the preposition 'u' upon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_830">309:2</a> The ha<i>m</i>sa is the vehicle of Brahmâ. The white ha<i>m</i>sa is probably the same.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_834"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_834">309:6</a> Or, simply, 'though our fame;' or it may refer to the renown of Buddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_835"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_835">309:7</a> Referring to the Buddhist account of the destruction and renovation of the universe; the last 'calamity' or 'judgment' was the destruction by water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_836"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_836">310:1</a> This may refer to one of the highest <i>Ri</i>shis, or Pra<i>g</i>âpatî <i>Ri</i>shis, belonging to the Vedic literature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_837"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_837">310:2</a> Here is the same phrase, 'ti yih i,' the first, or highest, truth, or principle of truth (paramârtha).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_838"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_838">310:3</a> Whose wisdom sees that which (<i>k</i>é) is above, or superior, (to man.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_839"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_839">310:4</a> The difficulty is to find a word in English corresponding to the Buddhist phrase 'all in the world;' it is not only 'mankind' (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 183) that are invited to trust in Buddha, but all things that have life. The Chinese phrase is '<i>k</i>ung sing,' all that lives.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_840"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_840">310:5</a> Not 'liu to,' where 'liu to' is equivalent to 'ruddha' in the proper name Anuruddha. I take the word, therefore, in the sense of 'stopped'--it is used, of course, as a figure of speech; so also in the next phrase. Anuruddha is here taken as A-niruddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_841"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_841">311:1</a> Ni-liu-to, equal to 'niruddha.'</p>

 <img src="img/31101.jpg"></p>
 <p><a name="fn_843"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_843">311:3</a> The Chinese 'feou' means a 'floating' pile or mass, whether of clouds or fanciful worlds. Hence its use in the later Buddhist development to mean a 'series of worlds' (as in the successive stages of the pagoda).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_844"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_844">311:4</a> Or, the <i>Ri</i>shi-hermit-mountain, referring probably to Buddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_845"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_845">311:5</a> Referring again to Buddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_846"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_846">311:6</a> The literal translation would be, 'only makes impermanence, destruction.' There may be an error in the text, but this sense is sufficiently plain. The meaning of the word 'curtain,' or, perhaps, 'standard,' is not quite so evident in this connection, it is evidently used in opposition to the 'diamond mace,' in the preceding clause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_847"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_847">311:7</a> This and the following lines are obscure; the reference must be gathered from Sanskrit rather than Chinese. The line before us, rendered literally, is 'six seeds, one bud.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_848"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_848">312:1</a> The four 'yin' may be the four points of the compass. But the text is without note or comment.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_849"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_849">312:2</a> The Chinese symbol 'koo' means a 'libation cup.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_850"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_850">312:3</a> The symbols 'shi-hi' correspond with Sanskrit <i>s</i>ikhin; I have therefore taken it in the sense of 'crested.' There may be a bird, however, called <i>S</i>ikhin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_851"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_851">312:4</a> The expression 'he returns to Nirvâ<i>n</i>a' is unusual; I have therefore used the alternative meaning which the symbol 'kwei' sometimes has, 'finding refuge in.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_852"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_852">313:1</a> This passage is a difficult one; if the construction is closely followed, the rendering would be this,' The illustrious charioteer (with) his seven swift steeds, the army host quickly (or, the wings of the army host) following him about.' Possibly it must be connected with the lines which follow, and refers to the saptâ<i>s</i>vavâhana of Sûrya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_853"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_853">313:2</a> Kwong-kwong, well-rayed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_854"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_854">313:3</a> The Yen-tsz’ cave is the fabulous hiding-place of the sun. The fable is a common one, particularly in Japanese mythology. I do not know whether it is found in Sanskrit literature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_855"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_855">313:4</a> The reference in this and the preceding lines is to the disappearance of the sun and moon, and the darkness of the world, compared to the Nirvâ<i>n</i>a of Tathâgata.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_856"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_856">313:5</a> This is a free translation; I have taken 'tsiueh' as an intensitive particle.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_857"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_857">314:1</a> The streams of his virtuous qualities.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_858"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_858">314:2</a> This verse again is doubtful. The entire section (a hymn of praise in honour of the departed Buddha) is couched in obscure, figurative language.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_859"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_859">314:3</a> His well-composed and illustrious person, knowing perfectly all the reflections of men. 'Nim' is sometimes used to signify 'prayers' or 'aspirations.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_860"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_860">315:1</a> Each one satisfied; the sense seems to be that through him, i.e. Buddha, all things obtained the completion of their religious desires.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_861"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_861">315:2</a> Or it may be by way of exclamation, 'those eight rules which admit of no pollution!' referring perhaps to the name 'the noble rules.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_862"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_862">315:3</a> I suppose 'the five' are the five senses. The expression 'difficult to compose' might be also rendered 'the difficult to compose group.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_863"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_863">315:4</a> Using (i) 'the three,' and yet seeing the 'three.' The next line is, 'removing the three,' and yet perfecting 'the three.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_864"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_864">315:5</a> Or it may be 'treasuring the one,' where 'the one' may be the one duty of a religious life; but it is difficult to interpret these paradoxes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_865"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_865">316:1</a> The sense seems to be, that in the case of those leading a virtuous life, i.e. a moral life, the seeds of holiness take root.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_866"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_866">316:2</a> All these verses might be introduced with some such exclamation as this, 'See! how he went forth!' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_867">316:3</a> Perhaps the word '<i>k</i>u' might be rendered 'a ruling principle,' viz. of religion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_868">317:1</a> The literal translation of this passage is curious: 'Even as at the end of the great kalpa, those holding the law, asleep; the mysterious cloud rolling forth its cracking (thunder), riving the forests, there descends as rain sweet dew.' The end of the great kalpa is the consummation of all things: 'the religious who sleep' would mean the good who are dead; 'the cracking thunder and riven forests' would point to a general overthrow; 'the rain of sweet dew' seems to refer to the good who sleep, receiving immortality, or perfection of life.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_869"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_869">317:2</a> 'The little elephant' may mean 'the young elephant' in its literal sense; or it may refer to 'the young disciple.' 'By cherishing it we know' may also be rendered 'knowledge-cherishing' is able, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_870"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_871">317:3</a> 'The cloud removing the elephant old and sorrowful;' but what is 'the cloud' and who 'the elephant?'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_871"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_872">318:1</a> This sentence may perhaps be rendered thus, 'dividing his body yet one in substance, wading through water and yet not weak,' but the allusion is obscure. [It refers, probably, to Buddha's miraculous powers.]</p>
 <p><a name="fn_872"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_873">319:1</a> The meaning is, all his births, in which his senses or material body took every kind of shape; all these he knew. The figurative style of this 'hymn' may be gathered from this one instance, where instead of saying 'all his previous births' it is said 'his senses wandering through the field (limits or boundaries) of sense.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_873"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_874">320:1</a> Infantry, cavalry, and chariots.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_874"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_875">320:2</a> That is, as it seems, Anuruddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_875"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_876">321:1</a> The Mallas (wrestlers) are termed 'lih-sse,' strong-masters, in Chinese. They dwelt at Ku<i>s</i>inagara and Pavâ. The Li<i>k</i><i>kh</i>avis are also called lih-sse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_876"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_877">321:2</a> The holy law-king, dharmarâ<i>g</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_877"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_878">321:3</a> The 'great awakening' refers, of course, to Buddha as 'the awakened.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_878"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_879">322:1</a> The 'gem-decked couch' or palanquin is probably represented in plate lxiv, fig. 1 (Tree and Serpent Worship, first edition). This is the procession of the couch through Ku<i>s</i>inagara. The curly-haired men bearing it would indicate that the Mallas and Li<i>k</i><i>kh</i>avis of Vai<i>s</i>âlî were the same race.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_879"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_880">322:2</a> The use of 'dance and music' at funerals is an old and well-understood custom. Compare Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, pp. 122, 123.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_881"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_882">323:2</a> Had their Nirvâ<i>n</i>a-<i>k</i>aityas erected. The account in the text does not agree with the Southern account; but the popular Chinese record of the Nirvâ<i>n</i>a is the same as the Pâli.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_882"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_883">323:3</a> He was between Pâvâ and Ku<i>s</i>inagara, according to the common account.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_883"></a><a href="sbe1929.htm#fr_884">324:1</a> The dharma-dhâtu (fă kai) is the mystic or ideal world of the Northern Buddhists.
