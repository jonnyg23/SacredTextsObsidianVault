   <h3 align="center">VARGA 18. CONVERSION OF <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">3</font></a> THE 'SUPPORTER OF THE ORPHANS AND DESTITUTE <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">4</font></a>' (ANÂTHAPI<i>N</i><i>D</i>ADA).</h3>  
 <p>At this time there was a great householder <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">5</font></a> whose name was 'Friend of the Orphan and Destitute;' he was very rich and of unbounded means, and widely charitable in helping the poor and needy. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1432</font></span></p>  
 <p>Now this man coming far away from the north, even from the country of Ko<i>s</i>ala <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">6</font></a>, stopped at the house of a friend whose name was Sheu-lo <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">7</font></a> (in Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1433</font></span></p>  
 <p>Hearing that Buddha was in the world and dwelling</p>

 <p>in the bamboo grove near at hand, understanding moreover his renown and illustrious qualities, he set out that very night <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the grove. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1434</font></span></p>  
 <p>Tathâgata, well aware of his character, and that he was prepared to bring forth purity and faith <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">2</font></a>, according to the case, called him by his true <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">3</font></a> (name), and for his sake addressed him in words of religion: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1435</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having rejoiced in the true law <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and being humbly <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">5</font></a> desirous for a pure and believing heart, thou hast overcome desire for sleep, and art here to pay me reverence; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1436</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now then will I for your sake discharge fully the duties of a first meeting <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">6</font></a>. In your former births the root of virtue planted firm in pure and rare expectancy <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">7</font></a>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1437</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Hearing now the name of Buddha, you rejoiced because you are a vessel fit for righteousness, humble</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>in mind, but large in gracious deeds, abundant in your charity to the poor and helpless-- 1438</p>  
 <p>'The name you possess wide spread and famous, (this is) the just reward (fruit) of former merit. The deeds you now perform are done of charity, done with the fullest purpose and of single heart. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1439</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now, therefore, take from me <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">1</font></a> the charity of perfect rest (Nirvâ<i>n</i>a), and for this end accept my rules of purity. My rules <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">2</font></a> are full of grace, able to rescue from destruction (evil ways of birth), <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1440</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And cause a man to ascend to heaven and share in all its pleasures. But yet to seek for these (pleasures) is a great evil, for lustful longing in its increase brings much sorrow. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1441</font></span></p>  
 <p>Practise then the art of "giving up <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">3</font></a>" all search, for "giving up" desire is the joy of perfect rest (Nirvâ<i>n</i>a) <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Know <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">5</font></a> then! that age, disease,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>and death, these are the great sorrows of the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1442</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Rightly considering the world, we put away birth and old age, disease and death; (but now) because we see that men at large inherit sorrow caused by age, disease, and death, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1443</font></span></p>  
 <p>'(We gather that) when born in heaven, the case is also thus; for there is no continuance there for any, and where there is no continuance there is sorrow, and having sorrow there is no "true self." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1444</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And if the state of "no continuance" and of sorrow is opposed to "self," what room is there for such idea or ground for "self <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">1</font></a>?" Know then! that "sorrow" is this very sorrow (viz. of knowledge), and its repetition is "accumulation <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">2</font></a>;" <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1445</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Destroy <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">3</font></a> this sorrow and there is joy, the way <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">4</font></a> is in the calm and quiet place. The restless busy nature of the world, this I declare is at the root of pain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1446</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Stop then the end by choking up the source <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Desire not either life (bhava) or its opposite; the raging fire of birth, old age, and death burns up the world on every side. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1447</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Seeing the constant toil (unrest) of birth and death we ought to strive to attain a passive state (no-thought), the final goal of Sammata <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the place of immortality <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">2</font></a> and rest. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1448</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All is empty! neither "self," nor place for "self," but all the world is like a phantasy; this is the way to regard ourselves, as but a heap of composite qualities (sa<i>m</i>skâra).' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1449</font></span></p>  
 <p>The nobleman hearing the spoken law forthwith attained the first <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">3</font></a> degree of holiness, he emptied, as it were, the sea of birth and death, one drop <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">4</font></a> alone remaining. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1450</font></span></p>  
 <p>By practising, apart from men, the banishment of all desire he soon attained the one impersonal</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>condition, not <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">1</font></a> as common folk do now-a-day who speculate upon the mode of true deliverance; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1451</font></span></p>  
 <p>For he who does not banish sorrow-causing sa<i>m</i>skâras does but involve himself in every kind of question; and though he reaches to the highest form of being, yet grasps not the one and only truth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1452</font></span></p>  
 <p>Erroneous thoughts as to the joy of heaven are still entwined by the fast cords of lust <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The nobleman attending to the spoken law the cloud of darkness opened before the shining splendour; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1453</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus he attained true sight, erroneous views for ever dissipated; even as the furious winds of autumn sway to and fro and scatter all the heaped-up clouds. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1454</font></span></p>  
 <p>He argued <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">3</font></a> not that Î<i>s</i>vara was cause, nor did he advocate some cause heretical, nor yet again did he affirm there was no cause for the beginning of the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1455</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If the world was made by Î<i>s</i>vara deva <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">4</font></a>, there should be neither young nor old, first nor after, nor the five ways of birth (transmigration); and when once born there should be no destruction. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1456</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Nor should there be such thing as sorrow or calamity, nor doing wrong nor doing right; for all,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>both pure and impure deeds, these must come from Î<i>s</i>vara deva. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1457</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if Î<i>s</i>vara deva made the world there should be never question (doubt) about the fact, even as a son born of his father ever confesses him and pays him reverence. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1458</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Men when pressed by sore calamity ought not (if Î<i>s</i>vara be creator) to rebel against him, but rather reverence him completely, as the self-existent. Nor ought they to adore more gods than one (other spirits). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1459</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if Î<i>s</i>vara be the maker he should not be called the self-existent <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">1</font></a>, because in that he is the maker now he always, should have been the maker (ever making). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1460</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if ever making, then ever self-remembering  <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and therefore not the self-existent one. And if he made without a mind (purpose) then is he like the sucking child; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1461</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if he made having an (ever prompting) purpose, then is he not, with such a purpose, self-existent. Sorrow and joy spring up in all that lives, these at least are not the works of Î<i>s</i>vara; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1462</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For if he causes grief <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">3</font></a> and joy, he must himself</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>have love (preference) and hate; but if he loves unduly, or has hatred, he cannot properly be named the self-existent. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1463</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if Î<i>s</i>vara be the maker, all living things should silently submit, patient beneath the maker's power, and then what use to practise virtue? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1464</font></span></p>  
 <p>'’Twere equal, then, the doing right or wrong, there should be no reward of works; the works themselves being his making, then all things are the same with him, the maker. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1465</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if all things are one with him, then our deeds, and we who do them, are also self-existent. But if Î<i>s</i>vara be uncreated, then all things (being one with him) are uncreated. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1466</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if you say there is another cause beside him as creator, then Î<i>s</i>vara is not the "end of all" (Î<i>s</i>vara, who ought to be inexhaustible, is not so), and therefore all that lives may after all be uncreated (without a maker). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1467</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thus, you see, the thought of Î<i>s</i>vara is overthrown in this discussion (<i>s</i>âstra); and all such contradictory assertions should be exposed; if not, the blame is ours <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1468</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if it be said self-nature <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the maker, this</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>  
 <p>is as faulty as the first assertion; nor has either of the Hetuvidyâ <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>s</i>âstras asserted such a thing as this, till now. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1469</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That which depends on nothing cannot as a cause make that which is; but all things round us come from a cause, as the plant comes from the seed; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1470</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We cannot therefore say that all things are produced by self-nature. Again, all things which exist (are made) spring not from one (nature) as a cause; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1471</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And yet you say self-nature is but one, it cannot then be cause of all. If you say that that self-nature pervades and fills all places, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1472</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If it pervades and fills all things, then certainly it cannot make them too; for there would be nothing, then, to make, and therefore this cannot be the cause. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1473</font></span></p>  
 <p>If, again, it fills all places and yet makes all things that exist, then it should throughout "all time" have made for ever that which is, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1474</font></span></p>  
 <p>But if you say it made things thus, then there is nothing to be made "in time <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">2</font></a>;" know then for certain self-nature cannot be the cause of all. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1475</font></span></p>  
 <p>Again, they say that that self-nature excludes all</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>gu<i>n</i>as <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">1</font></a> (modifications), therefore all things made by it ought likewise to be free from gu<i>n</i>as. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1476</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But we see, in fact, that all things in the world are fettered throughout by gu<i>n</i>as, therefore, again, we say that self-nature cannot be the cause of all. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1477</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If, again, you say that that self-nature is different from such qualities (gu<i>n</i>as), (we answer), since self-nature must have ever caused, it cannot differ in its nature (from itself); <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1478</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But if the world (all living things) be different from these qualities (gu<i>n</i>as), then self-nature cannot be the cause. Again, if self-nature be unchangeable, so things should also be without decay; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1479</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If we regard self-nature as the cause, then cause and consequence of reason should be one; but because we see decay in all things, we know that they at least are caused. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1480</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if self-nature be the cause, why should we seek to find "escape?" for we ourselves possess this nature; patient then should we endure both birth and death. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1481</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For let us take the case that one may find "escape," self-nature still will re-construct the evil of birth. If self-nature in itself be blind, yet ’tis the maker of the world that sees. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1482</font></span></p>  
 <p>'On this account again it cannot be the maker, because, in this case, cause and effect would differ in their character, but-in all the world around us, cause and effect go hand in hand. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1483</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Again, if self-nature have no purpose <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">2</font></a> (aim), it</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>cannot cause that which has such purpose. We know on seeing smoke there must be fire, and cause and result are ever classed together thus. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1484</font></span></p>  
 <p>'We are forbidden, then, to say an unthinking cause can make a thing that has intelligence. The gold of which the cup is made is gold throughout from first to last. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1485</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Self-nature then that makes these things from first to last must permeate all it makes. Once more, if "time" is maker of the world, ’twere needless then to seek "escape," <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1486</font></span></p>  
 <p>'For "time" is constant and unchangeable, let us in patience bear the "intervals" of time. The world in its successions has no limits, the "intervals" of time are boundless also. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1487</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Those then who practise a religious life need not rely on "methods" or "expedients." The To-lo-piu Kiu-na <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">1</font></a> (Tripuna gu<i>n</i>a <i>s</i>âstra?), the one strange <i>S</i>âstra in the world, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1488</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Although it has so many theories (utterings), yet still, be it known, it is opposed to any single cause. But if, again, you say that "self <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">2</font></a>" is maker, then surely self should make things pleasingly, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1489</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But now things are not pleasing for oneself, how then is it said that self is maker? But if he did not wish to make things so, then he who wishes for things pleasing, is opposed to self, the maker. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1490</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Sorrow and, joy are not self-existing, how can these be made by "self?" But if we allow. that self was maker, there should not be, at least, an evil karman <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1491</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But yet our deeds produce results both good and evil, know then that "self" cannot be maker. But perhaps you say "self" is the maker according to occasion <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">2</font></a> (time), and then the occasion ought to be for good alone; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1492</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But as good and evil both result from "cause," it cannot be that "self" has made it so. But if you adopt the argument--there is no maker--then it is useless practising expedients  <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1493</font></span></p>  
 <p>'All things are fixed and certain of themselves, what good to try to make them otherwise? Deeds of every kind, done in the world, do, notwithstanding, bring forth every kind of fruit; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1494</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Therefore we argue all things that exist are not without some cause or other. There is both "mind" and "want of mind," all things come from fixed causation; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1495</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The world and all therein is not the result of "nothing" as a cause.' The nobleman <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">4</font></a> (householder), his heart receiving light, perceived throughout the most excellent system of truth, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1496</font></span></p>  
 <p>Simple, and of wisdom born; thus firmly settled</p>

 <p>in the true doctrine he lowly bent in worship at the feet of Buddha and with closed hands made his request: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1497</font></span></p>  
 <p>'I dwell indeed at <i>S</i>râvastî (Sâvatthi) <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">1</font></a>, a land rich in produce, and enjoying peace; Prasena<i>g</i>it (Pasenit) <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the great king thereof, the offspring of the "lion" family; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1498</font></span></p>  
 <p>'His high renown and fame spread everywhere, reverenced by all both far and near. Now am I wishful there to found a Vihâra, I pray you of your tenderness accept it from me. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1499</font></span></p>  
 <p>'I know the heart of Buddha has no preferences, nor does he seek a resting-place from labour, but on behalf of all that lives refuse not my request.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1500</font></span></p>  
 <p>Buddha, knowing the householder's heart, that his great charity was now the moving cause, untainted and unselfish charity, nobly considerate of the heart of all that lives <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1501</font></span></p>  
 <p>(He said), 'Now you have seen the true doctrine, your guileless heart loves to exercise its charity, for wealth and money are inconstant treasures, ’twere better quickly to bestow such things on others. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1502</font></span></p>

 <p>man, knowing their inconstancy, gives freely, doing acts of kindness with his saved possessions. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1503</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But the niggard guards them carefully, fearing to lose them, worn by anxiety, but never fearing (worst of all!) "inconstancy <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">1</font></a>," and that accumulated sorrow, when he loses all! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1504</font></span></p>  
 <p>'There is a proper time and a proper mode in charity, just as the vigorous warrior goes to battle, so is the man "able to give," he also is an able warrior; a champion strong and wise in action. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1505</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The charitable man is loved by all, well-known and far-renowned! his friendship prized by the gentle and the good, in death his heart at rest and full of joy! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1506</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He suffers no repentance, no tormenting fear, nor is he born a wretched ghost or demon! this is the opening flower of his reward, the fruit that follows--hard to conjecture <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">2</font></a>! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1507</font></span></p>  
 <p>'In all the six conditions born there is no sweet companion like pure charity; if born a Deva or a man, then charity brings worship and renown on every hand; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1508</font></span></p>  
 <p>'If born among the lower creatures (beasts), the result of charity will follow in contentment got; wisdom leads the way to fixed composure without dependence and without number <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1509</font></span></p>

 <p>'In every thought the heart is filled with joy, firm fixed in holy contemplation (samâdhi), by meditation still we add to wisdom, able to see aright (the cause of) birth and death; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1511</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Having beheld aright the cause of these, then follows in due order perfect deliverance. The charitable man discarding earthly wealth, nobly excludes the power of covetous desire; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1512</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Loving and compassionate now, he gives with reverence and banishes all hatred, envy, anger. So plainly may we see the fruit of charity, putting away all covetous and unbelieving ways, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1513</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The bands of sorrow all destroyed, this is the fruit of kindly charity. Know then! the charitable man has found the cause of final rescue; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1514</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Even as the man who plants the sapling, thereby secures the shade, the flowers, the fruit (of the tree full grown); the result of charity is even so, its reward is joy and, the great Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1515</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The charity which unstores <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">2</font></a> wealth leads to returns of well-stored fruit.

 <p>'Some also give away to get a name for charity, others to get the happiness of heaven, others to avoid the pain of being poor (hereafter), but yours, O friend! is a charity without such thoughts, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1518</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The highest and the best degree of charity without self-interest or thought of getting more. What your heart inclines you now to do, let it be quickly done and well completed! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1519</font></span></p>

The nobleman accepting Buddha's teaching, his kindly heart receiving yet more light, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1520</font></span></p>  
 <p>He invited Upatishya <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">2</font></a>, his excellent friend, to accompany him on his return to Ko<i>s</i>ala; and then going round to select a pleasant site, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1521</font></span></p>  
 <p>He saw the garden of the heir-apparent, <i>G</i>eta, the groves and limpid streams most pure. Proceeding where the prince was dwelling, he asked for leave to buy the ground; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1522</font></span></p>  
 <p>The prince, because he valued it so much, at first was not inclined to sell, but said at last: 'If you can cover it with gold then, but not else, you may possess it <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1523</font></span></p>

 <p>The nobleman, his heart rejoicing, forthwith began to spread his gold. Then <i>G</i>eta said: 'I will not give, why then spread you your gold?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1524</font></span></p>  
 <p>The nobleman replied, 'Not give; why then said you, "Fill it with yellow gold?"' And thus they differed and contended both, till they resorted to the magistrate. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1525</font></span></p>  
 <p>Meanwhile the people whispered much about his unwonted <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">1</font></a> (charity), and <i>G</i>eta too, knowing the man's sincerity, asked more about the matter: what his reasons were. On his reply, 'I wish to found a Vihâra, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1526</font></span></p>  
 <p>'And offer it to the Tathâgata and all his Bhikshu followers,' the prince, hearing the name of Buddha, received at once illumination, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1527</font></span></p>  
 <p>And only took one half the gold, desiring to share in the foundation: 'Yours is the land (he said), but mine the trees; these will I give to Buddha as my share in the offering.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1528</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then the noble took the land, <i>G</i>eta the trees, and settled both in trust on <i>S</i>âriputra. Then they began to build the hall, labouring night and day to finish it; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1529</font></span></p>

 <p>Never yet so great a miracle as this! the priests shone in the streets of <i>S</i>râvastî!

 <p><a name="fn_518"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_518">201:3</a> Literally, 'he converts,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_519"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_519">201:4</a> This is the Chinese explanation of the name of Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada (or Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika), 'the protector or supporter of the destitute.' He is otherwise called Sudatta (see Jul. II, 294).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_520"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_520">201:5</a> The Chinese is simply 'ta <i>k</i>ang <i>k</i>é,' but this is evidently the equivalent of 'Mahâ-se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i,' a term applied emphatically to Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada (see Rhys Davids, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiii, p. 202, note 2). Where I have translated it 'nobleman,' the word 'treasurer' might be substituted; the term 'elder' cannot be allowed. Yasa the son of a se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i is called by Rh. D. a 'noble youth' (op. cit., p. 102, § 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_521"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_521">201:6</a> That is, Uttara Ko<i>s</i>ala (Northern Ko<i>s</i>ala), the capital of which was <i>S</i>râvastî.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_522"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_522">201:7</a> Rhys Davids gives the name of one of the rich merchant's daughters, <i>K</i>ûla-Subhaddâ (Birth Stories, p. 130; perhaps his friend at Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha was called Sûla or Kûla (see also Manual of Buddhism, p. 219).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_523"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_523">202:1</a> The statements that he came 'by night,' and that Buddha called him by his name--or, as the Chinese might be translated, called him 'true' (? guileless)--appear as though borrowed from the Gospel narrative. Nicodemus was rich, and Nathaniel (Bartholomew) preached in India (Euseb. Lib. v. cap. 10). He is said to have carried the Gospel of St. Matthew there, where it was discovered by Pantaenus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_524"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_524">202:2</a> That is, that he was ripe for conversion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_525"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_525">202:3</a> The name by which he was called, according to Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p. 217), was Sudatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_526"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_526">202:4</a> That is, 'because' you have rejoiced. The 'true law' is the same as 'religious truth.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_527"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_527">202:5</a> Literally, 'pure and truthful of heart, with meekness thirsting (after knowledge).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_528"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_528">202:6</a> The meaning is, as we have now met for the first time, I will explain my doctrine (preach) in a formal (polite) way.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_529"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_529">202:7</a> That is, your merit in former births has caused you to reap a reward in your present condition.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_530"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_530">203:1</a> The construction here is difficult. There seems to be a play on the word 'shi,' religious charity; the sense is, that as Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada was remarkable for his liberality now, he should be liberally rewarded by gaining a knowledge of salvation (Nirvâ<i>n</i>a).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_531"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_531">203:2</a> Instead of 'my rules,' it would be better to understand the word in an indefinite sense as 'rules of morality' (<i>s</i>îla).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_532"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_532">203:3</a> 'Giving up,' that is, putting away all desire and giving up 'self,' even in relation to future reward; compare the hymn of S. Francis Xavier,</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'O Deus, ego amo Te<br> Nec amo Te ut salves me,' etc.</dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And again,</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Non ut in coelo salves me<br> Nec praemii ullius spe.'</dir>  
 <p></p>
 <p><a name="fn_533"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_533">203:4</a> This definition of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, as a condition of perfect rest resulting from 'giving up' desire, is in agreement with the remarks of Mr. Rhys Davids and others, who describe Nirvâ<i>n</i>a as resulting from the absence of a 'grasping' disposition.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_534"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_534">203:5</a> It would seem, from the context, that the word '<i>k</i>i' (know), in this line, is a mistake for 'sing,' birth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_535"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_535">204:1</a> The argument is, that there can be no personal self, in other words, no 'soul,' where there is no continuance, or power of independent existence. This is one of the principles of Buddhism, viz. that what has had a beginning must come to an end; the 'soul,' therefore, as it began with the birth of the individual, must die (and as the Buddhists said) with the individual. If we put this into modern phraseology, it will be something like this, 'the very nature of phenomena demonstrates that they must have had a beginning, and that they must have an end' (Huxley, Lay Sermons, p. 17).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_536"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_536">204:2</a> The sorrow of 'accumulation' is the second of the 'four truths' (according to Northern accounts).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_537"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_537">204:3</a> 'Destruction' is the third great truth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_538"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_538">204:4</a> The 'way' is the fourth truth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_539"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_539">204:5</a> The sentiment here enunciated is repeated, under various forms, in Dhammapada; the first paragraph in the Sûtra of Forty-two Sections, also, exhibits the same truth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_540"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_540">205:1</a> Sammata or Sammati seems to be the same as Samatha in Pâli (concerning which, see Childers, Pâli Dict. sub voce). The Chinese expression 'yih sin' (one heart) is generally equivalent to 'sammata,' ecstatic union. It cannot here be rendered by samâdhi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_541"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_541">205:2</a> The place of 'sweet dew' (am<i>ri</i>ta).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_542"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_542">205:3</a> That is, of a Srotâpanna. Spence Hardy, in his Manual of Buddhism, p. 218, also says that Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada entered the first path after hearing the sermon; but in his account the sermon consisted of two stanzas only, 'He who is free from evil desire attains the highest estate and is always in prosperity. He who cuts off demerit, who subdues the mind and attains a state of perfect equanimity, secures Nirvâ<i>n</i>a; this is his prosperity.' In this account the idea of 'prosperity' is the same as the 'charity of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a' in our version.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_543"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_543">205:4</a> This appears to allude to the circumstance that at the dedication of the Vihâra Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ada arrived at the third degree of holiness, after which there was but one birth (drop) more to experience before reaching Nirvâ<i>n</i>a (Manual of Buddhism, p. 220).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_544"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_544">206:1</a> These lines appear to be by way of reflection.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_545"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_545">206:2</a> 'Lust' in the sense of 'appetite.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_546"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_546">206:3</a> Here follows a long dissertation on the subject of the 'maker' of the world. The theories refuted are (1) that Î<i>s</i>vara is maker, (2) that self-nature is the cause, (3) that time is the maker, (4) that self (in the sense of 'universal self') is the cause, (5) that there is no cause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_547">206:4</a> Here I begin with inverted commas, as if the discourse were either spoken by Buddha or interpolated by A<i>s</i>vaghosha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_548">207:1</a> In the sense of 'existing in himself' or independently. How entirely Northern Buddhism changed its character shortly after A<i>s</i>vaghosha's time, is evident from the fact that Avalokites.vara, 'the god who looks down' (in the sense of protector), became an object of almost universal worship, and was afterwards regarded as the creating god.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_549">207:2</a> That is, ever 'purposing' to make, and so not complete in himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_550">207:3</a> 'This question, "unde malum et quare,"' was the question that of old met the thoughtful at every turn. And it has always <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a> done so. Many of the arguments used in the text may be found in works treating on the subject of 'evil' and its origin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_551">208:1</a> So the passage must be translated; but if so, it would appear, as before stated, that this discourse on the 'maker' is introduced here parenthetically by A<i>s</i>vaghosha, not as spoken by Buddha. No doubt the theories and their confutations were such as prevailed in his day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_552">208:2</a> By self-nature, or, original nature, is evidently meant 'svabhâva.' The theory of such a cause had evidently gained ground at this time in the North, although it seems unknown amongst <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a> Southern Buddhists. Nâgasena wrote a <i>S</i>âstra ('of one <i>s</i>loka') to disprove it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_553">209:1</a> The usual Chinese expression for 'hetuvidyâ' is 'in ming;' here the phrase is 'ming in;' but I suppose this to be either an error, or equivalent with the other. The Hetuvidyâ sâstra is a treatise on the 'explanation of causes.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_554">209:2</a> The argument seems to be that self-nature must have made all things from the first as they are; there is no room therefore for further creation, but things are still made, therefore self-nature cannot be the cause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_555">210:1</a> That is, that it is nirgu<i>n</i>a, devoid of qualities.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_556"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_556">210:2</a> "No purpose'--no heart; if we take the two powers of soul <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a>(according to the scholastic method) to be a 'vis cognitiva' and a 'vis effectiva,' the expression in the text appears to correspond with the latter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_557">211:1</a> I do not know any other way of restoring these symbols than the one I have used. But what is the Tripuna gu<i>n</i>a sâstra?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_558">211:2</a> 'Self' in the sense of a 'universal cause' co-extensive with the things made.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_559"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_559">212:1</a> There should not be works producing birth in one of the evil ways.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_560"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_560">212:2</a> I do not understand the point here; literally the passage is 'saying self according to time makes'--the Chinese 'ts’ui ski' means 'whenever convenient,' or 'at a good time;' so that the passage may mean 'but if you say that self creates only when so prompted by itself.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_561">212:3</a> That is, using means for salvation or escape from sorrow.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_562">212:4</a> Here the narrative seems to take up the thread dropped at v. 1451.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_563">213:1</a> She-po-ti; evidently a Pâli or Prâkrit form of the Sanskrit <i>S</i>râvastî. The Chinese explanation of this name is (as found in the next line) a 'country of abundance.' It has been identified by General Cunningham with Sâhet Mâhet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_564">213:2</a> Po-sze-nih, i.e. Prasena<i>g</i>it (victorious army). With respect to this king, we know from Hiouen Thsang (Jul. II, 317) that he did not belong to the <i>S</i>âkya race, but he became a convert to Buddhism. His son Virûdhaka massacred a number of the <i>S</i>âkyas, 'and the ground was covered with their dead bodies as with pieces of straw' (Jul. II, 317). The king is here described as belonging to the Si<i>m</i>ha race; probably he was a Scyth, of the same family as the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>is, one tribe of whom was called the 'lion' tribe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_565">214:1</a> 'Inconstancy,' or 'death.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_566">214:2</a> This is a singular expression, implying that the character of a good man's final condition is difficult to describe: 'it has not entered the heart.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_567">214:3</a> These two lines appear to be irrelevant; nor do I understand the last phrase 'without number,' in its connection with the context.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_568">215:1</a> The eight recollections (nim); doubtless these are the eight 'samâpattis' (attainments or endowments), concerning which we may consult Childers' Pâli Dict., sub 'samâpatti.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_569">215:2</a> That is, which does not store up wealth, but unstores it to give away. There seems to be here a tacit allusion to Sudatta's wealth, which he unstored and gave in charity by purchasing the garden of <i>G</i>eta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_570">215:3</a> That is, Vihâras.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_571">216:1</a> These two lines are probably proverbial, something of this kind, 'the uncertain, amorous mind is profligate (wandering), the enlightened man comes to himself.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_572">216:2</a> Upatissa is the same as <i>S</i>âriputra. Hiouen Thsang (Jul. II, 296) says that Buddha sent <i>S</i>âriputra with Sudatta, to advise and counsel him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_573">216:3</a> The famous contract between Sudatta and <i>G</i>eta, the heir-apparent, is well known, and may be read in all the translations of the <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a> lives of Buddha. There is a representation of the proceeding in plate lvii (Bharhut Stûpa). I may observe here that the figure immediately in front (by the side of <i>G</i>eta, the prince, who is apparently giving away the trees, whilst Sudatta below him is giving the land), whistling with thumb and forefinger, and waving the robe, is typical of a number of others in these sculptures similarly engaged (see e<i>g</i>. plate xiii [outer face]).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_574">217:1</a> Or, the unwonted circumstance; or, the 'unusual' character of Sudatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="sbe1920.htm#fr_575">218:1</a> The expression 'to rest' may also mean 'to observe the rainy season rest,' if the ordinance of Wass had been enacted at this time.</p>
