 <p>FROM Vaisali, the Master went to Cravasti, to Jeta's park. One day, King Prasenajit came to see him. "My Lord," said the king, "six hermits have recently arrived in Cravasti. They do not believe in your law. They maintain that your knowledge is not equal to theirs, and they have tried to astonish me by performing numerous prodigies. I believe their statements to be untrue, but it would be well, my Lord, if you were to confound their audacity. The world's salvation depends upon your glory. So appear before these cheats and impostors and silence them."</p>  
 <p>"King," replied the Buddha, "order a great hall to be built near the city. Have it finished in seven days. I shall proceed there. Arrange to have the evil hermits present, and you will then see who performs the greatest prodigies, they or I."</p>  
 <p>Prasenajit ordered the hall to be built.</p>  
 <p>While awaiting the day of the trial, the lying hermits sought to delude the Master's faithful followers, and those who refused to listen to their evil</p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>words incurred their bitter enmity. Now, the Master had no truer friend in Cravasti than Prince Kala, a brother of Prasenajit. Kala had shown his utter contempt for the hermits, and they decided to take their revenge.</p>  
 <p>Kala was a very handsome man. One day, as he was walking through the royal gardens, he met one of Prasenajit's wives, and she playfully threw him a garland of flowers. The hermits heard of the incident, and they told the king that his brother had tried to seduce one of his wives. The king flew into a great rage, and without giving Kala a chance to justify himself, he had his hands and feet cut off.</p>  
 <p>Poor Kala suffered pitifully. His friends stood around his couch, weeping. One of the evil hermits happened to pass by.</p>  
 <p>"Come, show your power," they said to him. "You know that Kala is innocent. Make him well again!"</p>  
 <p>"He believes in the son of the Sakyas," replied the hermit. "It behooves the Sakyas’ son to make him well again."</p>  
 <p>Then Kala began to sing:</p>  
 <p>"How can the Master of the worlds fail to see my misery? Let us worship the Lord who no longer knows desire; let us adore the Blessed One who takes pity on all creatures."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ananda suddenly appeared before him.</p>  
 <p>"Kala," said he, "the Master has taught me the words that will heal your wounds."</p>  
 <p>He recited a few verses, and the prince immediately recovered the use of his limbs.</p>  
 <p>"Henceforth," he exclaimed, "I shall serve the Master! However humble the tasks which he may assign to me, I shall perform them with joy, to please him."</p>  
 <p>And he followed Ananda to Jeta's park. The Master received him graciously and admitted him to the community.</p>  
 <p>The day arrived on which the Master was to compete with the hermits. Early in the morning, King Prasenajit went to the hall he had had built for this occasion. The six hermits were already there. They exchanged glances and smiled.</p>  
 <p>"King," said one of them, "we are the first to arrive at the place of meeting."</p>  
 <p>"Do you suppose the one we are expecting will really come?" said another.</p>  
 <p>"Hermits," said the king, "do not scoff at him. You know how he sent one of his disciples to cure my brother whom I had unjustly punished. He will come. He may even be here, in our midst, without our knowing it."</p>  
 <p>As the king finished speaking, a luminous cloud filled the hall. It became lighter and lighter; it</p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>melted into the daylight, and the Buddha appeared, arrayed in golden splendor. Behind him stood Ananda and Kala. Ananda held a red flower in his hand, Kala a yellow flower, and never, in all the gardens of Cravasti, had any one seen two such flowers as these.</p>  
 <p>Prasenajit showed his profound admiration. The evil hermits ceased their laughter.</p>  
 <p>The Blessed One spoke:</p>  
 <p>"The glowworm shines for all to see, as long as the sun stays hidden, but when the blazing star appears, the poor worm quenches his feeble light. The impostors spoke loudly as long as the Buddha was silent, but now that the Buddha speaks, they weep with fear and are silent."</p>  
 <p>The hermits were alarmed. They saw the king viewing them with a scornful eye, and they hung their heads in shame.</p>  
 <p>Suddenly, the roof of the hall disappeared, and on the dome of the sky, stretching from the east to the west, the Master traced a course over which he proceeded to travel. At the sight of this prodigy, his most insolent rival fled in terror. The hermit imagined he was being pursued by a howling pack. of hounds, and he never stopped running until he came to the edge of a pool. There, he tied a stone to his neck and threw himself into the water. A fisherman found his body the following day.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the meanwhile, the Master had created a being in his own image, and, with him, he was now walking in the celestial path. And his great voice was heard, saying:</p>  
 <p>"O my disciples, I am about to ascend to the abode of the Gods and the Goddesses. Maya, my mother, has summoned me; I must instruct her in the law. I shall remain with her three months. But, each day, I shall descend to earth, and Sariputra, alone, will know where to find me; he will rule the community according to my instructions. And while I am absent from the sky, I shall leave with my mother, to instruct her, this being whom I have created in mine own image."</p>
