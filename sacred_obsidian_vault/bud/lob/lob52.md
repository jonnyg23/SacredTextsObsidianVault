 <p>THE monk Devadatta was possessed of an arrogant nature. He was impatient of any restraint. He aspired to supplant the Buddha, but the monks, he knew, would not join him in an open revolt. For that he needed the support of some king or prince.</p>  
 <p>"King Vimbasara is an old man," he said to himself, one day; "Prince Ajatasatru, who is young and brave, is eager to succeed him to the throne. I could advise the prince to his advantage, and, in return, he could help me to become the head of the community."</p>  
 <p>He went to see Ajatasatru. He addressed him in flattering terms; he praised his strength, his courage, his beauty.</p>  
 <p>"Oh, if you were king," said he, "what glory would come to Rajagriha! You would conquer the neighboring states; all the sovereigns of the world would pay you homage: you would be the omnipotent master, and you would be worshipped like a God."</p>  
 <p>With such words as these, Devadatta won Ajatasatru's</p>  
 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p>confidence. He received many precious gifts, and he became still more arrogant.</p>  
 <p>Maudgalyayana noticed Devadatta's frequent visits to the prince. He decided to warn the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>"My Lord," he began, "Devadatta is very friendly with Prince Ajatasatru."</p>  
 <p>The Blessed One interrupted him.</p>  
 <p>"Let Devadatta do as he pleases; we shall soon know the truth. I am aware that Ajatasatru pays him homage; it does not advance him a single step in the path of virtue. Let Devadatta glory in his arrogance! It will be his ruin. As the banana-tree and the bamboo-tree bear fruit only to die, so will the honors Devadatta is receiving simply hasten his downfall."</p>  
 <p>Devadatta soon reached the height of vanity. He could not abide the Buddha's grandeur, and, one day, he made bold to say to him:</p>  
 <p>"Master, you are now well along in years; it is a great hardship for you to rule the monks; you should retire. Meditate in peace upon the sublime law you have discovered, and the community let me take charge of."</p>  
 <p>The Master smiled quizzically.</p>  
 <p>"Be not concerned about me, Devadatta; you are too kind. I shall know when it is time to retire. For the present, I shall stay in charge of the community.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Besides, when the time does come, I shall not give it even to Sariputra or Maudgalyayana, those two great minds that are like blazing torches, and you want it, Devadatta, you who have such a mediocre intelligence, you who shed even less light than a night-lamp!"</p>  
 <p>Devadatta bowed respectfully before the Master, but he could not hide the fire of anger in his eyes.</p>  
 <p>The Master then sent for learned Sariputra.</p>  
 <p>"Sariputra," said he, "go through the city of Rajagriha and cry in a loud voice: 'Beware of Devadatta! He has strayed from the path of righteousness. The Buddha is not responsible for his words or for his actions; the law no longer inspires him, the community no longer interests him. Henceforth, Devadatta speaks only for himself.'"</p>  
 <p>It grieved Sariputra to have such a painful mission to perform; however, he understood the Master's reasons, and he went through the city crying Devadatta's shame. The inhabitants stopped to listen, and some thought, "The monks envy Devadatta his friendship for Prince Ajatasatru." But the others said, "Devadatta must have committed a serious offense, for the Blessed One thus publicly to denounce him."</p>
