 <p>The method of transliteration for Sanskrit words adopted in the present book is one used in Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar, but from lack of type <i>sh</i> has been substituted for <i>ṣ</i>, <i>r</i> for the vowel <i>ṛ</i>, <i>n</i> for all the different kinds of nasal <i>n</i>'s, and <i>m</i> for <i>ṁ</i>. Further, no distinction has been made in the footnotes between the dentals and the cerebrals; <i>c</i> and <i>ç</i> are also often used indiscriminately there.</p>  
 <p>As to the method of transliteration for Chinese words, almost every Sinologue has his own; but the one used in this book is that of Sir T. Wade, which I think has been adopted more generally than others.</p>
