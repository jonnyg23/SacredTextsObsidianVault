 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the road spider you say he ought to have, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the road spider weaves the curtain of its net on the road, and whatsoever is caught therein, whether worm, or fly, or beetle, that does he catch and eat; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, spread the curtain of the net of self-possession over the six doors (of his six senses), and if any of the flies of evil are caught therein, there should he seize them. This, O king, is the quality of the road spider he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"His heart should he shut in, at its six doors,<br>
 By self-possession, best and chief of gifts,<br>
 Should any evil thoughts be caught within,<br>
 Them by the sword of insight should he slay <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p></dir>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>2. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the child at the breast you say he ought to take, [<b>408</b>] which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the child at the breast sticks to its own advantage, and if it wants milk, cries for it;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a></p>
 <p>just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, adhere to his own good, and in everything--in teaching, in asking and answering questions, in the conduct of life, in the habit of solitude, in association with his teachers, in the cultivation of the friendship of the good--should he act with knowledge of the Truth. This, O king, is the quality of the child at the breast he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Dîgha Nikâya, in the Suttanta of the Great Decease:</p>
 <p>"Be zealous, rather, I beseech you, Ânanda, in your own behalf. Devote yourselves to your own good. Be earnest, all aglow, intent on your own good <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">1</font></a>!"'</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>3. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the land tortoise which you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the land tortoise, being afraid of the water, frequents places far from it, and by that habit of avoiding water its length of life is kept undiminished; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, seeing the danger in the want of earnestness, be mindful of the advantages that distinguish earnestness. For by that perception of</p>

 Who sees the danger of indifference,<br>
 Shall fall not from his high estate away,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>4. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the mountain height you say he ought to have, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the mountain height is a hiding-place for the wicked; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep secret the offences and failings of others, revealing them not. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
 <p>5. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is void of many people; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, [<b>409</b>] earnest in effort, be void of lust, angers, follies, and pride, of the net of (wrong) views <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of all evil dispositions.

 <p>6. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is a lonely spot, free from crowding of men; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude, and free from evil, unworthy qualities, from those that are not noble. This, O king, is the third quality of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
 <p>7. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is clean and pure; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be good and pure, happy, and without self-righteousness. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>

This, O king, is the second quality of the tree he ought to have.</p>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the rain lays any dust that arises; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, lay the dust and dirt of any evil dispositions that may arise within him. This, O king, is the first quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
 <p>13. 'And again, O king, just as the rain allays the heat of the ground; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, soothe the whole world of gods and men, with the feeling of his love. This, O king, is the second quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
 <p>14. 'And again, O king, as the rain makes all kinds of vegetation to grow; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cause faith to spring up in all beings, and make that seed of faith grow up into the three Attainments, not only the lesser attainments of glorious rebirths in heaven or on earth, but also the attainment of the highest good, the bliss of Arahatship <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

This, O king, is the fifth quality of the rain he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>

 Were it a hundred or a thousand leagues,<br>

Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 614, renders this, 'shall I arrive at the advantage of the attainment of the fruits of the path.' And he may be right, as the word uttari<i>m</i> is used. But the context seems to imply the rendering I have ventured to give, which preserves the usual connotation in this connection of the other two words of the phrase. A Bhikshu, for instance, on seeing a faded flower, will try to realise, to conjure up before his mind, the real fact of the transitoriness of all earthly (and of all heavenly) things. That is the specific idea of which he is in search, the deer he has to catch. No doubt it is only an intermediate step to the realisation of the fruits of the path. But as visesa<i>m</i> adhiga<i>kkh</i>ati is the technical term for success in such meditation, I cannot but think that the mind of our author was directed to the intermediate, rather than to the later stage of the Bhikshu's endeavour. The Si<i>m</i>halese has, perhaps, been guided by the verse, but there the word visesa<i>m</i> is omitted.</p>

See above, p. 267 (of the Pâli), and Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 198, 434, 488, from which it is clear that pheggu is a technical term applied to the softer portions of every tree, no doubt the outside portions. Sâra, on the other hand, means not pith, but heart of a tree. The Si<i>m</i>halese words are sambulu and ara<i>t</i>uwa. Compare the ebony tree, the outside of which is as soft and white as deal, whereas the inside is black and hard.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_837"></a><a href="sbe3614.htm#fr_846">362:3</a> This passage will be found of the greatest importance for the history of the development of early Buddhist belief. In the present state of our knowledge--or rather of our ignorance--of that subject, its obscure allusions are no doubt unintelligible. But they will not always remain so. And, when rightly understood, they will be expressly valuable inasmuch as they refer to that department of Buddhist belief of which we know, from other sources, the least. The development--or degeneration, if the expression be preferred--of Buddhist doctrine took place along three principal lines. Firstly, in the doctrine as to the person of the Buddha; secondly, in the pushing of Arahatship into the background and the elevation, in its place, of Bodisatship into the ideal; and thirdly, in the doctrine of the relation of man to the universe. We know a good deal of the growth of the legend of the Buddha, and of the change in the ethical standpoint. Of the evolution of the philosophic conceptions we know at present but little. It is on this last point that our author here lets us somewhat behind the scenes. The theses he <a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a> condemns are to some extent the same as those the discussion of which is condemned in the well-known passages in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, where similar lists occur. In other respects they are evidence of a different and later stage of thought than appears in those parts of the Pi<i>t</i>akas at present accessible. And on the positive side, in the closing words, though the author has evidently enough the old Arahatship in view, yet he chooses expressions which became the germ of the much later nihilism of the Mâdhyamika school, which has had so much influence in the more corrupt Buddhisms, more especially in China. As these later views never penetrated into Ceylon (or at least never had any vogue there, and were forgotten when Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê wrote), it is not surprising that the Si<i>m</i>halese scholar should be at fault in his interpretation of this difficult passage. Sanskrit Buddhist texts will be here the best commentary.</p>
