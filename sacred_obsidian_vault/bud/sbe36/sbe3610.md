 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the gourd which you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the gourd, climbing up with its tendrils <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">1</font></a> on to some other plant--whether a grass, or a thorn, or a creeper--grows all over it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, who desires to grow up into Arahatship, do so by climbing up with his mind over the ideas that present themselves (as subjects for the Kamma<i>tth</i>âna meditations). This, O king, is the one quality of the gourd which he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"As the gourd, clambering up with its tendrils, grows<br>
 O'er the grass, or the thorn-bush, or creeper widespread,<br>
 So the son of the Buddha on Ar'hatship bent,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>2. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the lotus which you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>[<b>375</b>] 'Just, O king, as the lotus, though it is born in the water, and grows up in the water, yet remains undefiled by the water (for no water adheres to it); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain undefiled by the support that he receives, or by the following of disciples that he obtains, or by fame, or by honour, or by veneration, or by the abundance of the requisites that he enjoys. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</p>
 <p>3. 'And again, O king, as the lotus remains lifted up far above the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain far above all worldly things. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</p>
 <p>4. 'And again, O king, as the lotus trembles when blown upon by the slightest breeze; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, exercise self-control in respect of the least of the evil dispositions, perceiving the danger (in the least offence). This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the lotus he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
 <p>"Seeing danger in the least offence, he takes upon himself, trains himself in, the precepts <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>5. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of seed which you say he ought to have, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as seed, tiny though it be, yet if sown in good soil, and if the god rains aright, will give abundant fruit; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, so conduct himself aright that the righteousness of his life may give abundantly of the fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the first quality of seed which he ought to have.</p>
 <p>6. 'And again, O king, as seed planted in well-weeded soil comes quickly to maturity; just so, O king, will his mind, when well-mastered <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and well-purified in solitude, if it be cast by the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, into the excellent field of self-possession, come quickly to maturity. This, O king, is the second quality of seed which he ought to have. [<b>376</b>] For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"If seed be sown on a well-weeded field,<br>
 Its fruit, abounding, will rejoice the sower.<br>
 So the recluse's heart, in solitude made pure,<br>

 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the Sal-tree grows within the ground to the depth of a hundred cubits or more; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, perfect in solitude the four Fruits of Samanaship, the four Discriminations, the six forms of transcendental Insight, and all the qualities befitting a recluse. This, O king, is the one quality of the Sal-tree he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Râhula, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"The tree that's called the Sal-tree grows above the earth,<br>
 And shoots beneath, a hundred cubits deep.<br>
 As in the fullness of time, and at its highest growth<br>
 That tree shoots in one day <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">1</font></a> a hundred cubits high,<br>
 Just so do I, O Buddha, like the Sal,<br>
 Increase, in solitude, in inward good."'</p></dir>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>8. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the ship that you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as a ship, by the combination of the quantity of the different kinds of timber of which it is composed, conveys many folk across; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cross the whole world of existence, whether in heaven, or on earth, by the combination of a number of qualities arising out of good conduct, righteousness, virtue, and the performance of duty.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> This, O king, is the first of the qualities of a ship he ought to have.</p>
 <p>9. 'And again, O king, just as a ship [<b>377</b>] can bear the onslaught of various thundering waves and of far-reaching whirlpools; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be able to bear the onslaught of the waves of various evil inclinations, and the onslaught of the waves of varied evils--veneration and contempt, support and honour, praise and exaltation, offerings and homage, blame and commendation in families not his own. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the ship he ought to have.</p>
 <p>10. 'And again, O king, as the ship journeys over the great ocean, immeasurable and infinite though it be, without a further shore, unshaken in its depths, roaring with a mighty noise, and filled with crowds of fish and monsters and dragons of all sorts; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make his mind journey through to penetration into the four Truths in their triple order, in their twelvefold form <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the ship he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Sa<i>m</i>yutta Nikâya, in the Sa<i>m</i>yutta on the Truths <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_722"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>
 <p>"Whenever you are thinking, O Bhikkhus, you should think: 'Such is sorrow,'--you should think 'Such is the origin of sorrow,'--you should think: 'Such is the end of sorrow,'--you should think: 'Such is the path that leads to the end of sorrow.'"'</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>11. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the anchor which you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the anchor, even in the mighty sea, in the expanse of waters agitated by the crowding of ever-varying waves, will fasten the ship, and keep it still, not letting the sea take it in one direction or another; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind stedfast in the mighty struggle of thoughts, in the waters of the waves of lust and malice and dullness, not letting them divert it in one direction or another. This, O king, is the first quality of the anchor he ought to have.</p>
 <p>12. 'And again, O king, as the anchor floats not, but sinks down, and even in water a hundred cubits deep holds the ship fast, brings it to rest; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he receives support, and fame, and honour, and veneration, and reverence, and offerings, and praise, [<b>378</b>] be not lifted up on the summit of the support or the fame, but keep his mind fixed on the idea of merely keeping his body alive. This, O king, is the second quality of the anchor he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"As the anchor floats not, but sinks down beneath the waves,<br>
 So be abased, not lifted up, by praise or gifts <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>13. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the mast which you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the mast carries ropes and braces and sails <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">1</font></a>; just so should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, always have mindfulness and self-possession--when going out or coming back, when looking ahead or looking round, when stretching forth his arm or bending it back, when wearing clothes or carrying his bowl, when eating or drinking or swallowing or tasting, when easing himself or walking or standing or sitting, when asleep or awake, when talking and when silent, never should he lose his mindfulness and self-possession. This, O king, is the one quality of the mast he ought to have <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>

 Raise yourselves up out of the slough of endless births,<br>

This, O king, is the second quality of the pilot he ought to have.</p>
 <p>16. 'And again, O king, as the pilot puts a seal on the steering apparatus <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">3</font></a> lest any one should touch it; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, put the seal of self-control on his heart, lest any evil or wrong thoughts should arise within it.

 <p>'Just as the sailor on board ship, O king, thinks thus: "I am a hireling, and am working for my wage on board this ship. By means of this ship is it that I get food and clothing. I must not be lazy, but zealously navigate the ship;" just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, think thus: "Gaining a thorough knowledge of this body of mine, put together of the four elements, continuously and unceasingly will I be self-possessed in mindfulness and thoughtfulness, and tranquil and peaceful will exert myself to be set free from births, old age, disease, and death, grief, lamentation, sorrow, suffering, and despair."

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>18. [<b>380</b>] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the sea you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the sea brooks no contact with a corpse <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">1</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, brook no association with the stains of evil--lust and malice and dullness and pride and delusion, concealing the faults one has and claiming virtues one has not <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">2</font></a>, envy and avarice, deceit and treachery and trickiness, wickedness and sinfulness of life. This, O king, is the first quality of the sea he ought to have.</p>
 <p>19. 'And again, O king, just as the sea carries within it stores of all kinds of gems--pearls and diamonds and cat's-eyes, and chank shells, and quartz <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and coral, and crystal, but conceals them all; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though he have attained to the various gems of character--the Path, and the Fruits</p>

This, O king, is the second quality of the sea he ought to have.</p>
 <p>20. 'And again, O king, just as the sea associates with mighty creatures; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, associate himself with a fellow-disciple who desires little and is contented, who is pure in speech <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whose conduct is directed to the eradication of evil, who is given to righteousness, modest, amiable, dignified, venerable, a speaker of profitable words, meek, one who will point out his associate's faults, and blame him when he does wrong, clever in admonition, in instruction, and in education, able to arouse, to incite, and to gladden--with such a man as a friend, in righteousness should he dwell. This, O king, is the third quality of the sea he ought to have.</p>
 <p>21. 'And again, O king, as the sea, though filled with the fresh water brought down by the Ganges, and the Jumna, and the A<i>k</i>iravatî, and the Sarabhû, and the Mahî, and by other rivers a hundred thousand in number, and by the rains of heaven, yet</p>

But the use of the nominatives sa<u>n</u>kho silâ in the corresponding list at <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 1, 3, 4 shows that by silâ, 'rock,' some kind of gem. is meant. And that our author does not intend to deviate from the earlier authority is clear from his own work (above, p. 267 of the Pâli), where he also gives the two nominatives in a similar, though longer, list of gems. What may be the particular gem referred to under the name 'rock' is doubtful. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 561, merely repeats the word silâ; and Clough, besides 'rock,' gives as special meaning only 'arsenic.' At <i>K</i>ullavagga ('Vinaya Texts,' III, 304) I have rendered it 'rock,' but 'quartz' now seems to me preferable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_736"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_745">304:1</a> It is very characteristic of our author that his interpretation of the gems into ethical conceptions is quite different from that of the <i>K</i>ullavagga, and much more mystic. In the older passage they are translated into the seven constituent characteristics of Arahatship. (See 'Vinaya Texts,' loc. cit., p. 305.) Compare also Divyâvadâna, pp. 115, 229.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_737"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_746">304:2</a> Dhuta-vâdo, not in Childers, and only found here. Perhaps ( who inculcates the keeping of the extra vows.' Dhuta<u>n</u>ga-wadiwû, says Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 561.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_738"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_747">305:1</a> Devâtidevena. It is not known when this epithet, which our author so constantly applies to the Buddha, first came into use. It is not found in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, and the Milinda is the oldest book in which it has been traced. It is given in the Mahâvyutpatti, page 1, as a recognised epithet, but not in the corresponding Pâli list of epithets in the Abhidhâna Padîpikâ (though deva-deva occurs there). The origin of the appellation is solemnly explained in the Divyâvadâna, p. 391. It is there said to have been first bestowed on the Buddha (when, as a child, he was presented in the temple), because all the gods bowed down before him. There is nothing about this in the corresponding passage of the Lalita Vistara, pp. 136-138. The epithet is used of the Buddha in an inscription of Toramâna Shâhi ('Epigraphia Indica' for October, 1889). It occurs also in a verse preserved in the commentaries on the Dhammapada and the <i>G</i>âtaka (<i>G</i>âtaka IV, 158 = Dhammapada 148)--a verse not found in the Pi<i>t</i>aka versions of the same episode--and is used in a kind of pun in the Mahâvamsa, chap. i, verse 56. But these three passages are all of the fifth century A.D.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_739"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_748">305:2</a> Not traced as yet. A similar parable is used at the passage already quoted from the <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 1, 3, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_740"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_749">306:1</a> The translation is here doubtful. The Si<i>m</i>halese apparently takes viggaha as qualifying pada, though it renders the whole by 'learning the rules of resolving words into their elements, and of building them up into compounds, and of Sandhi, and of conjugation, and of declension.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_741"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_750">306:2</a> Not reached as yet in Professor Fausböll's edition. Mr. Trenckner says the verse quoted is No. 47 in the 537th <i>G</i>âtaka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_742"></a><a href="sbe3610.htm#fr_751">306:3</a> The Si<i>m</i>halese reads Eva<i>m</i> hi me for Eva<i>m</i> h' ime, and renders 'listening to me.' Mr. Trenckner points out that the <i>G</i>âtaka MSS. read Evam pi te.</p>
