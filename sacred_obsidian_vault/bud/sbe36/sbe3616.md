 <h1 align="CENTER">ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">PART 1.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>P. xxv. For 'Mahâyâna' read 1 Madhyamika.' There is a Nâgasena mentioned in the Bharhut Tope.</p>
 <p>6, l. 1. Read 'to Tissa the Elder, the son of the Moggalî.' The whole sentence had better perhaps have been rendered: 'And these two also were foreseen by our Buddha (just as he foresaw Tissa the Elder, the son of the Moggalî), in that he foretold, saying, &amp;c.'</p>
 <p>30, n. 1. The phrase isi-vâta<i>m</i> parivâta<i>m</i> nagara<i>m</i> aka<i>m</i>su recurs at <i>G</i>âtaka III, 142; Samanta Pâsadikâ 316; Saddhamma Sa<i>m</i>gaha 41.</p>
 <p>32, n. 1. Compare Saddhamma Samgaha, p. 42.</p>
 <p>60, § 13. On the first simile, compare the Samyutta Nikâya XXII, 102, 7.</p>
 <p>76, last line. For 'yoke' read 'yolk.'</p>
 <p>78. It would have been better perhaps to have avoided the use of the words 'where' and 'there,' and to have rendered: 'In the case of beings who, having died, have been reborn elsewhere, time is. In the case of beings who, having died, have not been reborn elsewhere, time is not. And in the case of beings, &amp;c.' The three cases are those of the Puthu<i>gg</i>ana, the Arahat when dead, and the Arahat alive. My note refers to the third case, not to the second; and should, I think, be modified accordingly. See Sa<i>m</i>yutta Nikâya III, 12, 35; Mahâ Parinibbâna Sutta IV, 3; Dhammapada, verse 89; Sutta Nipâta II, 13, 1, 12; Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 235; <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 453; and compare Udâna, p. 80.</p>
 <p>Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê gives only a literal translation. A similar question is discussed in the Kathâ Vatthu XV, 3.</p>
 <p>99, n. 1. For 'chapter' read 'book, p. 39.'</p>
 <p>107, l. 16. After 'brought about' insert a comma.</p>
 <p>118, 5. I now prefer 'initiation' instead of 'ordination' as the translation of Upasampadâ.</p>
 <p>119, n. 1. This interpretation is confirmed by part ii, p. 197.</p>
 <p>129, l. 7. The phrase, 'though his hands and feet were cut off,' seems, at first sight, out of place. But compare part ii, p. 147.</p>
 <p>150, l. 2. Read I and not accepting them.'</p>
 <p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 378</font></a></p>
 <p>P. 153, § 18. Read 'Ki<i>ñk</i>â:' and compare <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 189.</p>
 <p>164 (six lines from the bottom of the page). Read 'and then a subsequent ease to the pain he has given.'</p>
 <p>176, § 39. In accordance with the note at part ii, pp. 86, 87, we must read 'a huge and mighty cauldron, full of water and crowded with grains of rice, is placed over a fireplace.'</p>
 <p>179. On the problem of king Sivi and his new eyes, compare the question discussed in Kathâ Vatthu III, 7.</p>
 <p>229, n. 1, l. 6. For 'these' read 'those.'</p>
 <p>239, n. 2. For 'But I never think' read 'But I now think.'</p>
 <p>241, § 20. For 'The Master said, Nâgasena,' read 'The Master said, O king.'</p>
 <p>244, n. 2. For '<i>G</i>atharaggi' read '<i>G</i>a<i>th</i>araggi.'</p>
 <p>278, n. 1. For 'adika' read 'âdika.'</p>
 <p>288, n. 3. For 'purdhita' read 'purohita.'</p>
 <p>190, n. 2. This story, which I could not trace, is no doubt the one referred to in Kariyâ Pi<i>t</i>aka I, 7.</p>
 <p>291, l. 22. Read 'Uposatha.'</p>
 </font><h3 align="CENTER">PART II.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>P. 27, last line but two. Read 'kâma-loka.'</p>
 <p>29, n. 2, l. 7. Read 'sa<i>m</i>sâra.'</p>
 <p>139, l, 4. For 'sun and moon' read 'moon and sun.'</p>
 <p>748, two lines from the bottom. For 'O king' read 'Sir.'</p>

 <p>166, n. 1. Read 'samâhato.'</p>
 <p>219, n. 2. Read 'bhavanâ.'</p>
 <p>252, l. 4. For 'pulling' read 'putting.'</p>
