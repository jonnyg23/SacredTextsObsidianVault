 <p>Now, venerable Nâgasena, if the former of these two passages was really spoken by the Tathâgata, then the second must be wrong.

 <p>that was said with respect to two matters only. And what are those two? The gift of a dwelling-place (Wihâra) has been praised and approved, esteemed and highly spoken of, by all the Buddhas. And those who have made such a gift shall be delivered from rebirth, old age, and death. This is the first of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place. And again, if there be a common dwelling place (a Wihâra) the sisters of the Order will have a clearly ascertained place of rendezvous, and those who wish to visit (the brethren of the Order) <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">1</font></a> will find it an easy matter to do so. Whereas if there were no homes for the members of the Order it would be difficult to visit them. This is the second of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place (a Wihâra). It was with reference to these two matters only that it was said by the Blessed One:</p><dir>

He who has no self-control as regards the stomach, O king, will destroy living creatures, will take possession of what has not been given to him, will be unchaste, will speak lies, will drink strong drink, will put his mother or his father to death, will slay an Arahat, will create a schism in the Order, will even with malice aforethought wound a Tathâgata.

 BAKKULA'S SUPERIORITY TO THE BUDDHA.]</p>
 <p>8. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One:</p>
 <p>"A Brahman am I, O brethren, devoted to self-sacrifice <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a>, pure-handed at every time; this body that I bear with me is my last, I am the supreme Healer and Physician <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</p>

 <p>'Now it is well known that diseases arose several times in the body of the Blessed One.

 <p>9. 'Both the quotations you have made, O king, are correct <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But what the Blessed One said about Bakkula was said of those disciples who had learnt by heart the sacred words, and studied them, and handed down the tradition, which in reference to the characteristics (each of them in some one point) had in addition to those which were found in him himself <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>. [<b>216</b>] For there were certain of the disciples of the Blessed One, O king, who were "meditators on foot," spending a whole day and night in walking up and down in meditation. But the Blessed One was in the habit of spending the day and night in meditation, not only walking up and down but also sitting and lying down. So such, O king, of the disciples as were "meditators on foot <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">3</font></a>" surpassed him in that particular.

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Blessed One was in the habit of taking a second, or even a third. So such, O king, of the disciples as were "eaters at one sitting" surpassed him in that particular. And in a similar way, O king, a number of different things have been told, each one of one or other of the disciples. But the Blessed One, O king, surpassed them all in respect of uprightness, and of power of meditation, and of wisdom, and of emancipation, and of that insight which arises out of the knowledge of emancipation, and in all that lies within the scope of a Buddha. It was with reference to that, O king, that he said:</p>
 <p>"A Brahman am I, O brethren, devoted to self-sacrifice, pure-handed at every time; this body that I bear with me is my last, I am the supreme Healer and Physician."</p>
 <p>10. 'Now one man, O king, may be of good birth, and another may be wealthy, and another full of wisdom, and another well educated, and another brave, and another adroit; but a king, surpassing all these, is reckoned supreme. just in that way, O king, is the Blessed One the highest, the most worthy of respect, the best of all beings. And in so far as the venerable Bakkula was healthy in body, that was by reason of an aspiration (he had formed in a previous birth) <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For, O king, when Anoma-dassî, the Blessed One, was afflicted with a disease, with wind in his stomach, and again when Vipassî, the Blessed One, and sixty-eight thousand of his disciples, were afflicted with a disease, with greenness of blood <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he,</p>

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>
 <p>being at those times an ascetic, had cured that disease with various medicines, and attained (thereby) to such healthiness of body (in this life) that it was said of him:</p>
 <p>"The chief, O brethren, among those who are disciples of mine, in the matter of bodily health, is Bakkula."</p>
 <p>11. 'But the Blessed One, O king, whether he be suffering, or not suffering from disease; whether he have taken, or not taken, upon himself the observance</p>

 <p>of special vows <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--there is no being like unto the Blessed One. [<b>217</b>] For this, O king, has been said by the Blessed One, the god of gods, in the most excellent Sa<i>m</i>yutta Nikâya <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>
 <p>"Whatsoever beings, O brethren, there may be whether without feet, or bipeds, or four-footed things, whether with a body, or without a body, whether conscious or unconscious, or neither conscious nor not--the Tathâgata is acknowledged to be the chief of all, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme."'</p>

 <p>"Already in former births when I was a man had I acquired the habit of inflicting no hurt on living beings <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>
 <p>But on the other hand it is said <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>
 <p>When he was Lomasa Kassapa, the Rishi, he had hundreds of living creatures slain and offered the great sacrifice, the 'Drink of Triumph <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'"</p>

 <p>'Now, Nâgasena, if it is true what the Buddha said, that, in his former births as a man, he inflicted no hurt on living beings, then the saying that, as Lomasa Kassapa, he had hundreds of living creatures slain must be false. But if he had, then the saying that he inflicted no hurt on living beings must be false. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</p>
 <p>17. 'The Blessed One did say, O king, that already in former births, when he was a man, he had acquired the habit of inflicting no hurt on living beings. And Lomasa Kassapa, the Rishi, did have hundreds of living creatures slain, and offered the great sacrifice, the "Drink of Triumph." [<b>220</b>] But that was done when he was out of his mind through lust, and not when he was conscious of what he was doing.'</p>
 <p>'There are these eight classes of men, Nâgasena, who kill living beings--the lustful man through his lust, and the cruel man through his anger, and the dull man through his stupidity, and the proud man through his pride, and the avaricious man through his greed, and the needy man for the sake of a livelihood, and the fool in joke, and the king in the way of punishment. These, Nâgasena, are the eight classes of men who, kill living beings. The Bodisat, venerable Nâgasena, must have been acting in accordance with his natural disposition when he did so.'</p>
 <p>'No, it was not, O king, an act natural to him that the Bodisat did then. If the Bodisat had been led, by natural inclination, to offer the great sacrifice, he would not have uttered the verse:</p>
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p><dir>

 <p>"Not the whole world, Sayha, the ocean girt,<br>

 Would I desire to have, along with shame <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>'But though, O king, the Bodisat had said that, yet at the very sight of <i>K</i>andavatî (Moon-face), the princess <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he went out of his mind and lost command of himself through love. And it was when thus out of his mind, confused and agitated, that he, with his thoughts all perplexed, scattered and wandering, thus offered the great sacrifice, the "Drink of Triumph,"--and mighty was the outpour of blood from the necks of the slaughtered beasts!</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as a madman, when out of his senses, will step into a fiery furnace, and take hold of an infuriated venomous snake, and go up to a rogue elephant, and plunge forwards into great waters, the further shore of which he cannot see, and trample through dirty pools and muddy places <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and rush into thorny brakes, and fall down precipices, and feed himself on filth, and go naked through the streets, and do many other things improper to be done--just so was it, O king, that at the very sight of <i>K</i>andavatî, the princess, the Bodisat went out of his mind, and then only acted as I have said <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>respect of the fruit that it brings about in a future life. Suppose, O king, that a madman had been guilty of a capital offence, what punishment would you inflict upon him?'</p>
 <p>'What punishment is due to a madman? We should order him to be beaten and set free. That is all the punishment he would have.'</p>
 <p>'So then, O king, there is no punishment according to the offence of a madman. It follows that there is no sin in the act done by a madman, it is a pardonable act. And just so, O king, is it with respect to Lomasa Kassapa, the Rishi, who at the mere sight of <i>K</i>andavatî, the princess, went out of his mind, and lost command of himself through love. It was when thus out of his mind, confused and agitated, that he, with his thoughts all perplexed, scattered and wandering, thus offered the great sacrifice, the "Drink of Triumph,"--and mighty was the outpour of blood from the necks of the slaughtered beasts! But when he returned again to his natural state, and recovered his presence of mind, then did he again renounce the world, and having regained the five powers of insight, became assured of rebirth in the Brahmâ world.'</p>

 He perceived the yellow robe, the badge of a recluse,<br>

This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</p>
 <p>20. 'The verse you have quoted, O king, was spoken by the Blessed One. And Kassapa the Blessed One, the Arahat, the Buddha supreme, was abused and reviled by Gotipâla the young Brahman with vile and bitter words, with the epithets of shaveling and good-for-nothing monk. But that was owing to his birth and family surroundings. For <i>G</i>otipâla, O king, was descended from a family of unbelievers, men void of faith. His mother and father, his sisters and brothers, the bondswomen and bondsmen, the hired servants and dependents in the house, were worshippers of Brahmâ, reverers of Brahmâ; and harbouring the idea that Brahmans were the highest and most honourable among men, they reviled and loathed those others who had renounced the world. It was through hearing what they said that <i>G</i>otipâla, when invited by Gha<i>t</i>îkâra the potter to visit the teacher, replied: "What's the good to you of visiting that shaveling, that good-for-nothing monk?"</p>

But when he had gone to him, and had come to know the virtues of the Buddhas which he had, then did he become as his hired servant; and having renounced the world and entered the Order under the system of the Conqueror, he gained the fivefold power of insight, and the eightfold power of ecstatic meditation, and became assured of rebirth into the Brahmâ heaven.'</p>

One would think that a Tathâgata should have the power to prevent that. If, Nâgasena, Gha<i>t</i>îkâra the potter's dwelling was kept dry when it was open to the sky, it cannot be true that a Tathâgata's hut got wet. But if it did, then it must be false that the potter's dwelling was kept dry. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</p>
 <p>23. 'Both the quotations you have made, O king, are correct. [<b>224</b>] Gha<i>t</i>îkâra the potter was a good man, beautiful in character, deeply rooted in merit, who supported his old and blind mother and father. And when he was absent, the people, without so much as asking his leave, took away the thatch from his dwelling to roof in with it the hut of the Tathâgata. Then, unmoved and unshaken at his thatch being thus removed, but filled rather</p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>
 <p>with a well-grounded and great joy the like of which cannot be found, an immeasurable bliss sprang up in his heart at the thought: "May the Blessed One, the chief of the world, have full confidence in me." And thereby did he obtain merit which brought forth its good result even in this present life.</p>
 <p>24. 'And the Tathâgata, O king, was not disturbed by that temporary inconvenience (of the falling rain). Just, O king, as Sineru, the king of the mountains, moves not, neither is shaken, by the onslaught of innumerable gales <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>--just as the mighty ocean, the home of the great waters, is not filled up, neither is disturbed at all, by the inflow of innumerable great rivers--just so, O king, is a Tathâgata unmoved at temporary inconvenience.</p>
 <p>'And that the rain fell upon the Tathâgata's hut happened out of consideration for the great masses of the people. For there are two circumstances, O king, which prevent the Tathâgatas from themselves supplying (by creative power) any requisite of which they may be in need <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And what are the two? Men and gods, by supplying the requisites of a Buddha on the ground that he is a teacher worthy of gifts, will thereby be set free from rebirth in states of woe. And lest others should find fault, saying: "They seek their livelihood by the working of miracles." If, O king, Sakka had kept that hut dry, or even Brahmâ himself, even then that action would have been faulty, wrong, and worthy of censure.</p>

 <p>'Pray what, Nâgasena, can be that reason?'</p>
 <p>'Because all evil qualities, not productive of merit, are in the Tathâgata suppressed, abandoned, put away, dispelled, rooted out, destroyed, come to an end, gone out, and ceased, therefore is it that the Tathâgata is called a Brahman <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a>. A Brahman <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a>, O king, means one who has passed beyond hesitation, perplexity, and doubt. And it is because the Tathâgata has done all this, that therefore also is he called a Brahman.

 <p>conditions of heart <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And it is because the Tathâgata does this that therefore also is he called a Brahman. A Brahman, O king, means one who carries on the line of the tradition of the ancient instructions concerning the learning and the teaching of sacred writ, concerning the acceptance of gifts, concerning subjugation of the senses, self-control in conduct, and performance of duty. And it is because the Tathâgata carries on the line of the tradition of the ancient rules enjoined by the Conquerors <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a> regarding all these things, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. [<b>226</b>] A Brahman, O king, means one who enjoys the supreme bliss of the ecstatic meditation. And it is because the Tathâgata does this, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. A Brahman, O king, means one who knows the course and revolution of births in all forms of existence. And it is because the Tathâgata knows this, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. The appellation "Brahman," O king, was not given to the Blessed One by his mother, nor his father, not by his brother, nor his sister, not by his friends, nor his relations, not by spiritual teachers of any sort, no, not by the gods. It is by reason of their emancipation that this is the name of the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones. From the moment when, under the Tree of Wisdom, they had overthrown the armies of the Evil One, had suppressed in themselves all evil qualities not productive of merit, and had attained to the knowledge of the Omniscient</p>

That is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king. A king means, O king, one who, exalted above all ordinary men, making those related to him rejoice, and those opposed to him mourn; raises aloft the Sunshade of Sovranty, of pure and stainless white, with its handle of firm hard wood <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and its many hundred ribs <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">4</font></a>,--the symbol of his mighty fame and glory. And the Blessed One, O king, making the army of the Evil One, those given over to false doctrine, mourn; filling the hearts of those, among gods or men, devoted to sound doctrine, with joy; [<b>227</b>] raises aloft over the ten thousand world systems the Sunshade of his Sovranty, pure and stainless in the whiteness of emancipation,</p>

 <p>with its hundreds of ribs fashioned out of the highest wisdom, with its handle firm and strong through long suffering,--the symbol of his mighty fame and glory. That too is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king. A king is one who is held worthy of homage by the multitudes who approach him, who come into his presence. And the Blessed One, O king, is held worthy of homage by multitudes of beings, whether gods or men, who approach him, who come into his presence. That too is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king. A king is one who, when pleased with a strenuous servant, gladdens his heart by bestowing upon him, at his own good pleasure, any costly gift the officer may choose <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And the Blessed One, O king, when pleased with any one who has been strenuous in word or deed or thought, gladdens his heart by bestowing upon him, as a selected gift, the supreme deliverance from all sorrow,--far beyond all material gifts <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">2</font></a>. That too is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king. A king is one who censures, fines <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or executes the man who transgresses</p>
 <p>

 <p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>the royal commands. And so, O king, the man who, in shamelessness or discontent, transgresses the command of the Blessed One, as laid down in the rules of his Order, that man, despised, disgraced and censured, is expelled from the religion of the Conqueror. That too is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king. A king is one who in his turn proclaiming laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by the righteous kings of ancient times, and thus carrying on his rule in righteousness, becomes beloved and dear to the people, desired in the world, and by the force of his righteousness establishes his dynasty long in the land. And the Blessed One, O king, proclaiming in his turn laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by the Buddhas of ancient times, and thus in righteousness being teacher of the world,--he too is beloved and dear to both gods and men, desired by them, and by the force of his righteousness he makes his religion last long in the land. That too is the reason why the Tathâgata is called a king.</p>
 <p>'Thus, O king, so many are the reasons why the Tathâgata should be both Brahman and also king, that the ablest of the brethren could scarcely in an æon enumerate them all. Why then should I dilate any further? Accept what I have said only in brief.'</p>

 Whene'er the Truth prevailed<br>
   Through every age <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>'But on the other hand the Blessed One, when preaching the Truth, or talking of it, was in the habit of beginning with the so-called "preliminary discourse," in which giving has the first place, and goodness only the second <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">2</font></a>. So that when gods and men heard this discourse of the Blessed One, the lord of the whole world, they prepared and gave gifts, and the disciples partook of the alms thus brought about. Now if, Nâgasena, it be true what the Blessed One said, that he accepted no gifts earned by the chaunting of sacred words, then it was wrong that the Blessed One put giving thus</p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>
 <p>into the foreground. But if he did rightly in so emphasizing the giving of gifts, then it is not true that he accepted no gifts earned by the utterance of sacred words. And why so? Because if any one worthy of offerings should praise to the laity the good results to them of the bestowal of alms, they, hearing that discourse, and pleased with it, will proceed to give alms again and again. And then, whosoever enjoy that gift, they are really enjoying that which has been earned by the utterance of sacred words. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</p>
 <p>29. 'The stanza you quote, O king, was spoken by the Blessed One. And yet he used to put the giving of alms into the forefront of his discourse. But this is the custom of all the Tathâgatas--first by discourse on almsgiving to make the hearts of hearers inclined towards it, and then afterwards to urge them to righteousness. This is as when men, O king, give first of all to young children things to play with--[<b>229</b>] such as toy ploughs <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">1</font></a>, tip-cat sticks <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">2</font></a>, toy wind-mills <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">3</font></a>, measures made of leaves <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">4</font></a>, toy carts,</p>

 <p>and bows and arrows--and afterwards appoint to each his separate task. Or it is as when a physician first causes his patients to drink oil for four or five days in order to strengthen them, and to soften their bodies; and then afterwards administers a purge. The supporters of the faith, O king, the lordly givers, have their hearts thus softened, made tender, affected. Thereby do they cross over to the further shore of the ocean of transmigration by the aid of the boat of their gifts, by the support of the causeway of their gifts. And (the Buddha), by this (method in his teaching), is not guilty of "intimation <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p>
 <p>30. 'Venerable Nâgasena, when you say "intimation" what are these intimations?'</p>
 <p>'There are two sorts, O king, of intimation--bodily and verbal. And there is one bodily intimation which is wrong, and one that is not; and there is one verbal intimation which is wrong, and one that is not. Which is the bodily intimation which is wrong? Suppose any member of the Order, in going his rounds for alms, should, when choosing a spot to stand on, stand where there is no room <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that is a bodily intimation which is wrong. The true members of the Order will not accept any alms so asked for, and the individual who thus acts is despised, looked down upon, not respected, held blameworthy, disregarded, not well thought of, in the religion of the Noble Ones; he is reckoned as</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>
 <p>one of those who have broken their (vows as to) means of livelihood. And again, O king, suppose any member of the Order, in going his round for alms, should stand where there is no room, and stretch out his neck like a peacock on the gaze, in the hope: "Thus will the folk see me"--that too is a bodily intimation which is wrong. True brethren will not accept an alms so asked for, and he who thus acts is regarded like the last. And again, O king, suppose any member of the Order should make a sign with his jaw, or with his eyebrow, or with his finger--[<b>230</b>] that too is a bodily intimation which is wrong. True brethren will not accept an alms so asked for, and he who thus acts is regarded the same way.</p>
 <p>31. 'And which is the bodily intimation which is not wrong? If a brother, on going his round for alms, be self-possessed, tranquil, conscious of his acts; if he stand, wherever he may go, in the kind of spot that is lawful; if he stand still where there are people desirous to give, and where they are not so desirous, if he pass on <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a>
 ;--that is a bodily intimation which is not wrong. Of an alms so stood for the true members of the Order will partake; and the individual who thus asks is, in the religion of the Noble Ones, praised, thought highly of, esteemed, and reckoned among those whose behaviour is without guile, whose mode of livelihood is pure. For thus has it been said by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p><dir>

 <p>"The truly wise beg not, for Arahats scorn to beg. <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a><br>

 </dir>
 
 <p>32. 'Which is the verbal intimation which is wrong? In case, O king, a brother intimate his wish for a number of things, requisites of a member of the Order--robes and bowls and bedding and medicine for the sick--that is a verbal intimation which is wrong. Things so asked for the true members of the Order (Ariyâ) will not accept; and in the religion of the Noble Ones the individual who acts thus is despised, looked down upon, not respected, held blameworthy, disregarded, not well thought of--reckoned rather as one who has broken his (vows as to) means of livelihood. And again, O king, in case a brother should, in the hearing of others, speak thus: "I am in want of such and such a thing;" and in consequence of that saying being heard by the others he should then get that thing--that too is a verbal intimation which is wrong. True members of the Order will not use a thing so obtained, and he who acts thus is regarded like the last. And again, O king, in case a brother, dilating in his talk <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">2</font></a>, give the people about him to understand: "Thus and thus should gifts be given to the Bhikkhus,"</p>

 <p>and in case they, on hearing that saying, should bring forth from their store anything so referred to--that too is a verbal intimation which is wrong. True members of the Order will not use a thing so obtained, and he who acts thus is regarded like the last. [<b>231</b>] For when Sâriputta, the Elder, O king, being ill in the night-time, after the sun had set, and being questioned by Moggallâna, the Elder, as to what medicine would do him good, broke silence; and through that breach of silence obtained the medicine--did not Sâriputta then, saying to himself: "This medicine has come through breach of silence; let not my (adherence to the rules regarding) livelihood be broken," reject that medicine, and use it not <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a>?

 <p>33. 'And what is the verbal intimation which is right? Suppose a brother, O king, when there is necessity for it, should intimate among families either related to him, or which had invited him to spend the season of Was with him <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that he is in want of medicines--this is a verbal intimation which is not wrong. True members of the Order will partake of things so asked for; and the individual who acts thus is, in the religion of the Noble Ones, praised, thought highly of, esteemed, reckoned among those whose mode of livelihood is pure,</p>

 <p>approved of the Tathâgatas, the Arahats, the Supreme Buddhas. And the alms that the Tathâgata, O king, refused to accept of Kasî-Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, the Brahman <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that was presented for the sake of testing him with an intricate puzzle which he would have to unwind <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for the sake of pulling him away, of convicting him of error, of making him acknowledge himself in the wrong. Therefore was it that the Tathâgata refused that alms, and would not partake thereof.'</p>
 <p>34. 'Nâgasena, was it always, whenever the Tathâgata was eating, that the gods infused the Sap of Life from heaven into the contents of his bowl, or was it only into those two dishes--the tender boar's flesh, and the rice porridge boiled in milk--that they infused it <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">3</font></a>?</p>
 <p>'Whenever he was eating, O king, and into each morsel of food as he picked it up--just as the royal cook takes the sauce and pours it over each morsel in the dish while the king is partaking of it <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">4</font></a>. [<b>232</b>] And so at Vera<i>ñg</i>â, when the Tathâgata was eating the cakes <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">5</font></a> made of dried barley, the gods moistened each one with the Sap of Life, as they placed it</p>

 ON THE BUDDHA'S AFTER-DOUBT <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">2</font></a>.]</p>
 <p>35. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say:</p>
 <p>"The Tathâgata gradually, through millions of years, through æon after æon <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">3</font></a>, brought his omniscient wisdom to perfection for the sake of the salvation of the great masses of the people <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">4</font></a>."</p>
 <p>'But on the other hand (they say) <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">5</font></a>:</p>
 <p>"Just after he had attained to omniscience his</p>

 <p>heart inclined, not to the proclamation of the Truth, but to rest in peace."</p>
 <p>'So that, Nâgasena, just as if an archer, or an archer's pupil, who had practised archery for many days with the object of fighting, should, when the day of the great battle had come, draw back--just so did the Tathâgata, who through countless ages had gradually matured his omniscience for the sake of bringing safe to the shore (of salvation) the great masses of the people, turn back, on the day when that omniscience had been reached, from proclaiming the Truth. just as if a wrestler who through many days had practised wrestling should, when the day of the wrestling match <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a> had come, draw back--just so did the Tathâgata, who through countless ages had gradually matured his omniscience for the sake of bringing safe to the shore (of salvation) the great masses of the people, turn back, on the day when that omniscience had been reached, from proclaiming the Truth.</p>
 <p>'Now was it from fear, Nâgasena, that the Tathâgata drew back, or was it from inability to preach <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or was it from weakness, or was it because he had not, after all, attained to omniscience? [<b>233</b>] What was the reason of this? Tell me, I pray, the reason, that my doubts may be removed. For if for so long a time he had perfected his wisdom with the object of saving the people, then the statement that he hesitated to announce the Truth must be wrong. But if that be true, then the other statement must be false. This too is a double-edged problem,</p>

 <p>now put to you,--a problem profound, a knot hard to unravel,--which you have to solve.'</p>
 <p>36. 'The statements in both the passages you quote, O king, are correct. But that his heart inclined, not to the preaching of the truth, but to inaction, was because he saw, on the one hand, how profound and abstruse was the Doctrine <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a>, how hard to grasp and understand, how subtle, how difficult to penetrate into; and, on the other, how devoted beings are to the satisfaction of their lusts, how firmly possessed by false notions of Individualism <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And so (he wavered) at the thought: "Whom shall I teach? And how can I teach him?"--his mind being directed to the idea of the powers of penetration which beings possessed.</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as an able physician, when called in to a patient suffering from a complication of diseases, might reflect: "What can be the treatment, what the drug, by which this man's sickness can be allayed?"--just so, O king, when the Tathâgata called to mind how afflicted were the people by all the kinds of malady which arise from sin, and how profound and abstruse was the Doctrine, how subtle, and how difficult to grasp, then at the thought: "Whom can I teach? And how shall I teach him?" did his heart incline rather to inaction than to preaching--[<b>234</b>] his mind being directed to the powers of penetration which beings possessed.</p>
 <p>'And just, O king, as a king, of royal blood, an anointed monarch, when he calls to mind the many</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>
 <p>people who gain their livelihood in dependence on the king--the sentries and the body-guard, the retinue of courtiers, the trading folk, the soldiers and the royal messengers, the ministers and the nobles <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a>--might be exercised at the thought: "How now, in what way, shall I be able to conciliate them all?"--just so when the Tathâgata called to mind how profound and abstruse was the Doctrine, how subtle, and how difficult to grasp, and how devoted beings were to the satisfaction of their lusts, how firmly possessed by false notions of Individualism, then at the thought: "Whom shall I teach? And how shall I teach him?" did his heart incline rather to inaction than to preaching--his mind being directed to the powers of penetration which beings possessed.</p>
 <p>37. 'And this, too, is an inherent necessity in all Tathâgatas that it should be on the request of Brahmâ that they should proclaim the Dhamma. And what is the reason for that? All men in those times, with the ascetics and the monks, the wandering teachers and the Brahmans, were worshippers of Brahmâ, reverers of Brahmâ, placed their reliance on Brahmâ. And therefore, at the thought: "When so powerful and glorious, so famous and renowned, so high and mighty a one has shown himself inclined (to the Dhamma), then will the whole world of gods and men become inclined to it, hold it fitting, have faith in it"--on this ground, O king, the Tathâgatas preached the Dhamma when requested to do so by Brahmâ. For just, O king, as what a sovran or a minister of state shows homage to, or offers worship to, that will the rest of mankind, on</p>

 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>
 <p>the ground of the homage of so powerful a personage, show homage to and worship--just so, O king, when Brahmâ had paid homage to the Tathâgatas, so would the whole world of gods and men. For the world, O king, is a reverer of what is revered. And that is why Brahmâ asks of all Tathâgatas that they should make known the Doctrine, and why, on so being asked, they make it known <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_30"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_30">1:1</a> This is the opening verse of the Muni Sutta (in the Sutta Nipâta I, 12). It is quoted again below, p. 385 of the Pâli text. The second line is, in the original, enigmatically terse, and runs simply, 'From a home dust arises.' This Fausböll renders (in the S. B. E., vol. x, part ii, p. 33), 'From household life arises defilement,' the word for dust (ra<i>g</i>o) being often used figuratively in the sense of something that disfigures, is out of place in the higher life. It is the distracting effect of household cares that the recluse has to fear.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_31"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_31">2:1</a> This is a very famous verse, found first in the Vinaya (<i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 1, 5), and quoted in the Introduction to the <i>G</i>âtakas (Fausböll, vol. i, p. 93; compare vol. iv., p. 354), translated in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i, p. 132. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê adds the context:</p><dir>

 The Truth dispelling every grief,<br>
 Which Truth when here a man perceives,<br>

 <p><a name="fn_35"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_35">4:1</a> This verse has not yet been traced. The first half of it occurs in a different connection at Dhammapada, verse 168, which I have rendered (at 'Buddhism,' p. 65), 'Rise up and loiter not!' without any reference at all to food. This was in accordance with the view taken of the passage, both by Prof. Fausböll, who renders it (p. 31 of his edition of the Pâli), 'Surgat, ne sit socors,' and by Prof. Max Müller, who renders it (S. B. E, vol. x, part i, p. 47), 'Rouse thyself, do not be idle!' And I still think (especially noting such passages as Dhammapada, verses 231, 232, and the verse quoted in the Commentary, p. 126 of Fausböll, from <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 496, &amp;c.) that this was the original meaning in that connection. But here the words must clearly be taken as referring to food, and it is very remarkable that the commentator on the Dhammapada (see p. 335 of Fausböll's edition) takes them in that sense also even in the other connection. It is a striking instance of the way in which commentators impart a purely technical sense into a general ethical precept.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_45"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_45">7:2</a> This is much more than a mere injunction not to gild refined gold. It comes very near to the enunciation of the dangerous doctrine that the holy man is above the law, and that nothing he does can be wrong. It is curious how frequently one finds this proposition cropping up in the most unexpected places, and the history of religious belief is full of instances of its pernicious effect on the most promising movements. When one considers the great influence of our author's work, it becomes especially interesting to note how the doctrine has never, among the orthodox Buddhists, who read the Pâli Scriptures, been extended from the Buddha himself to his followers, and from moderation in food to matters of more vital import in the life of a church. And this is the more remarkable as the Tantra works of the corrupt Buddhism of Nepal and Tibet show how fatal has been the result of the doctrine among those Buddhists who had lost the guiding support of the older Scriptures.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_47"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_47">8:2</a> This passage has not yet been traced in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, and the context is therefore unknown. But the word Brahman must of course be applied to the Buddha here in the sense, not of one belonging to the Brahman caste, but of Arahat. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê adds, as a gloss, bâhita-pâpa-brâhma<i>n</i>ayek, 'brahman because he has suppressed evil in himself.' On this explanation see my note to the forty-eighth dilemma, which is devoted to the discussion of this difficulty.</p>
 <p>On the Buddha as the Great Physician see Sutta Nipâta III, 7, 13; Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 429; Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî, 67, 255; and Milinda, pp. 110, 169 (of the Pâli text).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_49"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_49">9:1</a> Here, as always, they are repeated in full in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_50"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_50">9:2</a> This passage is very ambiguous. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê renders it: 'with reference to what was found in himself, and besides that (with reference) to the disciples who had learnt &amp;c. . . . . tradition.' He translates agamâna<i>m</i> and the two following words, as relative compounds, by agama-dhâri-wû, &amp;c., and in this I have followed him. But he supplies an 'and' after the last, thus taking them as accusatives in dependence on sandhâya, and that cannot be right. It seems forced to separate bâhirâna<i>m</i> so much from the other genitives with which it stands in the text, and yet it is so impossible to make sense of the passage in any other way, that one would like to know the readings of all the MSS.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_51">9:3</a> '<i>K</i>akkhupâla and others' adds Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê. (For the story of <i>K</i>akkhupâla, see the commentary on the Dhammapada, verse 1.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_52">10:1</a> See, for other instances of such aspirations, above, vol. i, p. 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_53">10:2</a> Ti<i>n</i>a-pupphaka-roga. There is a flower called ti<i>n</i>a-puppha, and this may be a skin disease named after it. But pupphaka at <i>G</i>âtaka III, 541, means blood, and the disease may <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a> be so called because the blood was turned by it to the colour of grass (ti<i>n</i>a). Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê (who gives these legends of the previous births of Bakkula at much greater length, adding others from the time of the Buddhas Padumuttara and Kassapa, and giving the story also of his present birth) says that the disease arose from contact with wind which had been poisoned through blowing over a Upas tree (p. 296 of the Si<i>m</i>halese version). But he does not explain the name of the disease, which occurs only here.</p>
 <p>In his present birth Bakkula is said to have been born at Kosâmbî, in a wealthy family. His mother, understanding that to bathe a new-born child in the Jumna would ensure him a long life, took him down to the river. Whilst he was there being bathed, a huge fish swallowed him. But the fish, caught at Benares, was sold to a wealthy but childless man there, and on being cut open, the babe was found in it unhurt.</p>
 <p>The mother hearing the news of this marvel, went in great state and with haste to Benares and claimed the child. Thereupon an interesting lawsuit arose, and the king of Benares, thinking it unjust to deprive the purchaser of a fish of anything inside it, and also unjust to deprive a mother of her child, decided that the child belonged equally to both. So he became the heir of both families, and was therefore called Bak-kula, 'the two-family-one' (Bak = Ba = Dvâ). On the real derivation of Bakkula, see Dr. Morris in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1886, pp. 94-99. We need not quarrel with a false etymology which shows us so clearly the origin of the legend. Then Bakkula enjoys great prosperity in the orthodox three palaces, and at eighty years of age, being still in vigorous health, enters the Order.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_56"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_56">12:3</a> This piece of casuistry is not so entirely at variance with the context of the second passage (quoted from the A<u>n</u>guttara I, 14) as would seem at first sight. The answer practically amounts to this, that though each of many disciples may be superior to the Buddha in certain bodily qualities, or even in the special vows known as Dhutangas, yet he surpasses them in the 'weightier matters of the law.' It is true that one of the instances given, that of the <i>th</i>âna-ka<u>n</u>kamikâ, is not included in the list of Dhutangas, and in the long enumeration in the A<u>n</u>guttara of those of the disciples who were 'chief' in any way, 'weightier matters of the law' are not overlooked. But 'meditation on foot' is of the same nature as the acknowledged Dhutangas, and none of the five special points in which Nâgasena places especially the superiority of the Buddha (uprightness, &amp;c.), is mentioned in the A<u>n</u>guttara. Nevertheless the logical reply to the problem proposed would have been that in the A<u>n</u>guttara the superiority spoken of is over other disciples, and not over the Buddha.</p>

There is no such conception in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, and the whole tone of our author's argument reveals the lateness of his date as compared with the Pi<i>t</i>akas.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_82">26:1</a> This argument is based on the false etymology that brâhma<i>n</i>o = bâhita-pâpo ('he in whom evil is suppressed'), adopted by Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê above at IV, 4, 55. Buddhaghosa, in the Suma<u>n</u>gala, p. 244, has another derivation: Brahma<i>m</i> a<i>n</i>atîti brâhma<i>n</i>o. As Brahmam has not been found elsewhere except as the accusative of Brahmâ the name of the god, and as a<i>n</i>ati only occurs in this passage, it might be contended that Buddhaghosa means an 'invoker of Brahmâ.' But I think he is correct in his etymology, and intends to interpret the word Brahman as 'intoner of prayer.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_87">28:1</a> This is a striking instance of argument in a circle. The word Brahman is first interpreted in its technical Buddhist sense of Arahat, and then the Buddha, as Arahat, is called a Brahman. The only paragraph based on the real transition of meaning in the term is that referring to the holding up of tradition.</p>

 <p>Parimutti, which I have not found in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, and which is not in Childers, occurs above (p. 112 of the Pâli text) in the same connection.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_93"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_95">31:2</a> See, for instance, Dîgha Nikâya V, 28; Mahâvagga I, 7, 5 and 10; V, X, 9; VI, 26, 8; and <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 4, 5. As there is a doubt about the spelling, Fausböll at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 8, and I, 30, and our MSS. of the Dîgha reading ânupubbi-kathâ, whereas Childers and Oldenberg read ânupubbi-kathâ, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the Si<i>m</i>halese has the short a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="sbe3603.htm#fr_96">32:1</a> All these articles are mentioned in the Dîgha Nikâya I, r, 14. Buddhaghosa explains the first word (va<u>n</u>kaka<i>m</i>) as toy ploughs. Hoops the Indian children do not have, probably for want of suitable roads.</p>

 <p>The word translated Arahats is Ariyâ, which is taken here, as elsewhere, as a dissyllable, and pronounced Aryâ. It is the same as our word Aryans, and is rendered above Noble Ones. I do not think that it is applied exclusively to Arahats.</p>
