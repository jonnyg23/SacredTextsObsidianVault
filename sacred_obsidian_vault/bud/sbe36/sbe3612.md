 <h3 align="CENTER">31. THE WHITE ANT.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that quality of the white ant which you say he ought to have, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the white ant goes on with his work only when he has made a roof over himself, and covered himself up; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on his round for alms, cover up his mind with righteousness and self-restraint as a roof. For in so doing, O king, will he have passed beyond all fear. This, O king, is the one quality of the white ant he ought to have. [<b>393</b>] For it was said, O king, by Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"The devotee who covers up his mind,<br>
 Under the sheltering roof of righteousness<br>
 And self-control, untarnished by the world<br>
 Remains, and is set free from every fear <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p></dir>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>2. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the cat you say he ought to have, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the cat, in frequenting caves and holes and the interiors of storied dwellings, does so only in the search after rats; just so, O king, should</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a></p>
 <p>the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, whether he have gone to the village or to the woods or to the foot of trees or into an empty house <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">1</font></a>, be continually and always zealous in the search after that which is his food, namely self-possession. This is the first quality of the cat he ought to have.</p>
 <p>3. 'And again, O king, as the cat in pursuing its prey always crouches down <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_770"><font size="1">2</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, continue conscious of the origin and end <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_771"><font size="1">3</font></a> of those five groups of the characteristic marks of individuality which arise out of clinging to existence, thinking to himself: "Such is form, such is its origin, such its end. Such is sensation, such is its origin, such its end. Such are ideas, such is their origin, such their end. Such are the mental potentialities (the Confections, Sa<i>m</i>khârâ), such is their origin, such their end. Such is self-consciousness, such is its origin, such its end <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">4</font></a>." This, O king, is the second quality of the cat he ought to have.

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>4. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the rat you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the rat, wandering about backwards and forwards, is always smelling after food <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">1</font></a>; just so, O king, [<b>394</b>] should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be ever in his wanderings to and fro, bent upon thought. This is the quality of the rat he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Ever alert and calm, the man of insight,<br>
 Esteeming wisdom as the best of all things,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>5. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the scorpion you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the scorpion, whose tail is its weapon, keeps its tail erect as it wanders about; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have knowledge as his weapon,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>
 <p>and dwell with his weapon, knowledge, always drawn. This, O king, is the quality of the scorpion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"With his sword of knowledge drawn, the man of insight<br>
 Should ever be unconquerable in the fight,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>6. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the mungoose you say he ought to take, which is it?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the mungoose, when attacking a snake, only does so when he has covered his body with an antidote; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when going into the world where anger and hatred are rife, which is under the sway of quarrels, strife, disputes, and enmities, ever keep his mind anointed with the antidote of love. This, O king, is the quality of the mungoose he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Therefore should love be felt for one's own kin,<br>
 And so for strangers too, and the whole wide world<br>
 Should be pervaded with a heart of love--<br>
 This is the doctrine of the Buddhas all."'</p></dir>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>7. [<b>395</b>] 'Venerable Nâgasena, the two qualities of the old male jackal you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the old male jackal, whatever kind of food he finds, feels no disgust, but eats of it as much as he requires; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, eat without disgust such food as he receives with the sole object of keeping himself alive. This, O king, is the first quality of the old male jackal he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahâ Kassapa, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Leaving my dwelling-place, I entered once<br>
 Upon my round for alms, the village street.<br>
 A leper there I saw eating his meal,<br>
 And, as was meet, deliberately, in turn,<br>
 I stood beside him too that he might give a gift.<br>
 He, with his hand all leprous and diseased,<br>
 Put in my bowl--'twas all he had to give--<br>
 A ball of rice; and as he placed it there<br>
 A finger, mortifying, broke and fell.<br>
 Seated behind a wall, that ball of food<br>
 I ate, and neither when I ate it, nay,<br>
 Nor afterwards, did any loathing thought<br>
 Arise within my breast <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>8. 'And again, O king, as the old male jackal, when he gets any food, does not stop to examine it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never stop to find out whether food given to him is bitter or sweet, well-flavoured or ill--just as it is should he be satisfied with it. This, O king, is the second quality of the old male jackal</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>
 <p>he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena Va<u>n</u>ganta-putta, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Bitter food too should he enjoy,<br>
 Nor long for what is sweet to taste.<br>
 The mind disturbed by lust of taste<br>
 Can ne'er enjoy the ecstacies<br>
 Of meditations high. The man content<br>
 With anything that's given--in him alone<br>
 Is Sama<i>n</i>aship made perfect <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p></dir>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>9. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the deer you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the deer frequents the forest by day, and spends the night in the open air; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, pass the day in the forest, and the night under the open sky. This, O king, is the first quality of the deer he ought to have. [<b>396</b>] For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the exposition called the Lomaha<i>m</i>sana Pariyâya:</p>
 <p>"And I, Sâriputta, when the nights are cold and wintry, at the time of the eights (the Ash<i>t</i>akâ festivals <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">2</font></a>), when the snow is falling, at such times did I pass the night under the open sky, and the day in the woods.

This, O king, is the second quality of the deer he ought to have.</p>
 <p>11. 'And again, O king, as the deer on catching sight of men escapes this way or that, that they may not see him; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he sees men of quarrelsome habits, given to contentions and strife and disputes, wicked men and inert, fond of society--then should he escape hither or thither that neither should they see him, nor he them <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_780"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

 <p>"Let not the man with evil in his heart,<br>
 Inert, bereft of zeal, of wicked life,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>12. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those four qualities of the bull you say he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the bull never forsakes its own stall; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never abandon his own body on the ground that its nature is only the decomposition, the wearing away, the dissolution, the destruction of that which is impermanent <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This, O king, is the first quality of the bull he ought to have.</p>
 <p>13. 'And again, O king, as the bull, when he has once taken the yoke upon him, bears that yoke through all conditions of case or of pain; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, [<b>397</b>] when he has once taken upon himself the life of a recluse, keep to it, in happiness or in woe, to the end of his life, to his latest breath. This, O king, is the second quality of the bull he ought to have.</p>
 <p>14. 'And again, O king, as the bull drinks water with never satiated desire; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, receive the instruction of his teachers and masters with a desire, love, and pleasure that is never satiated <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">2</font></a>.

 Lavish upon him--if he be but good,--<br>

This, O king, is the first quality of the boar he ought to have.</p>
 <p>17. 'And again, O king, as the boar, resorting to muddy water, digs into the swamp with his snout, and making a trough for himself, lies down therein; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, put his body away in his mind, and</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>18. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the five qualities of the elephant he ought to take, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the elephant, as he walks about, crushes the earth; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, mastering the nature of the body, crush out all evil. This, O king, is the first quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
 <p>19. 'And again, O king, as the elephant turns his whole body when he looks, always looking straight before him, not glancing round this way and that <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">2</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, turn his whole body when he looks, always looking straight before, not glancing round this way and that, not looking aloft, not looking at his feet, but keeping his eyes fixed about a yoke's length in front of him. This, O king, is the second quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
 <p>20. 'And again, O king, as the elephant has no permanent lair, even in seeking his food does not always frequent the same spot, has no fixed place of</p>

This, O king, is the third quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
 <p>21. 'And again, O king, as the elephant revels in the water, plunging into glorious lotus ponds full of clear pure cool water, and covered-over with lotuses yellow, and blue, and red, and white, sporting there in the games in which the mighty beast delights; [<b>399</b>] just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, plunge into the glorious pond of self-possession, covered with the flowers of emancipation, filled with the delicious waters of the pure and stainless clear and limpid Truth; there should he by knowledge shake off and drive away the Sa<i>m</i>khâras <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">2</font></a>, there should he revel in the sport that is the delight of the recluse.

Buddhaghosa on <i>K</i>ullavagga, VI, 1, 2, (putting only kû<i>t</i>âgâra, 'peaked chamber,' for barânda,) has the same explanation. Ten or twelve years is allowed in <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 17, 1, for the building of such a prâsâda. See also Mahâvagga I, 30, 4, and VI, 33, 2.</p>
