 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>2. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the harsh-voiced ass which you say he ought to take, which is that?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the ass, wheresoever he may lie down--whether on a dust heap, or in the open space where four roads meet, or three <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or at the entrance to a village, or on a heap of straw--[<b>366</b>]--nowhere is he given to resting long; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">2</font></a>, wheresoever he may spread out his mat for repose--whether on strewed grass, or leaves, or on a bed of thorns, or on the bare earth--nowhere should he be given to sloth.

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>3. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the cock which you say he ought to take, what are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as a cock goes early and betimes to roost; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, early and betimes sweep out the open space around the Dâgaba, and having got ready <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">2</font></a> the drinking-water for the day's use, and dressed himself <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and taken his bath, he should bow</p>

 <p>down in reverence before the Dâgaba, and then pay visits to the senior Bhikshus, and, on his return, enter in due time into the chamber of solitude. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the cock he ought to have.</p>
 <p>4. 'And again, O king, as a cock rises early and betimes; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rise early and betimes to sweep out the open space around the Dâgaba, and get ready the drinking-water for the day's use, and dress himself, and pay his daily reverence to the Dâgaba, and enter into the chamber of solitude. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the cock he ought to have.</p>
 <p>5. 'And again, O king, as the cock is unremitting in scratching the earth to pick up what he can find to eat; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise continual self-examination and circumspection in taking any nourishment he may find to eat, reminding himself: [<b>367</b>] "I eat this, seeking not after pleasure, nor after excitement, nor after beauty of body, nor after elegance of form, but merely for the preservation of my body, to keep myself alive, as a means of appeasing the pain of hunger, and of assisting me in the practice of the higher life. Thus shall I put an end to all former sorrow, and give no cause for future sorrow to arise; therein shall I be free from blame, and dwell at ease." This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p><dir>

 <p>6. 'And again, O king, as the cock, though it has eyes, is blind by night; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though he is not blind, be as one blind. Whether in the woods, or on his daily walk for alms in search of food, blind should he be and deaf and dumb to all delights of form, or sound, or taste, or smell, or touch, should not make them the objects of his thought, should pay no special, detailed, attention to them <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This, O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahâ Ka<i>kk</i>âyana, the Elder:</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Let him with eyes be as one blind,<br>
 And he who hears be as the deaf, <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a><br>
    He who can speak be as the dumb,<br>

For that, O king--his presence of mind--is the home in which he dwells. This, O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. [368] And this, O king, has been said by the Blessed One, the god over all gods <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">5</font></a>:</p>
 <p>"And which, O Bhikshus, is the Bhikshu's resort, the realm which is his own by right?--it is this, the four modes of being mindful and thoughtful <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">6</font></a>."</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>8. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the squirrel which you say he ought to take, which is that?'</p>
 <p>'Just as the squirrel, O king, when an enemy falls upon him, beats his tail on the ground till it swells, and then with his own tail as a cudgel drives off the foe; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when his enemy, sin, falls upon him, beat the cudgel of his self-possession till it swells, and then by the cudgel of self-possession drive all evil inclinations off. This, O king, is the one quality of the squirrel which he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by <i>K</i>ulla Panthaka, the Elder:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"When sins, those fell destroyers of the gains<br>
 Gained by the life of recluse, fall on us,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>9. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the female of the panther which you say he ought to take, which is that?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the female of the panther conceives only once, and does not resort again and again to the male <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">2</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,--seeing how future conceptions and births involve a period of gestation and a fall from each state as it is reached, and dissolution and death and destruction, seeing the horrors of transmigration and of rebirths in evil states, the annoyance of them, the torment of them,--he should stedfastly resolve never to enter upon any future life. [<b>369</b>] This, O king, is the one quality of the female panther which he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta, in the Sutta of Dhaniya the cowherd:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Like a strong bull who's burst the bonds that bound him,<br>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the panther, lying in ambush in wild places, behind a thicket of long grass or brushwood, or among the rocks, catches the deer; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, resort to solitary places in the woods, at the foot of a tree, on mountain heights, in caves and grottoes, in cemeteries, in forests, under the open sky, on beds of straw, in quiet, noiseless spots, free from strong winds, and hid from the haunts of men. For the strenuous Bhikshu, O king, earnest in effort, who frequents such solitudes, will soon become master of the six forms of transcendent insight. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the panther he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Elders who collected the scriptures:</p><dir>

 <p>"As the panther by lying in ambush catches the deer,<br>
 So the sons of the Buddha, with insight and earnestness armed,<br>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>12. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the tortoise which you say he ought to take, what are they? '</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the tortoise, which is a water animal, keeps to the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, let his heart go out over the whole wide world with pity and with love--mighty, abounding, beyond measure, free from every feeling of hatred or of malice--towards all creatures that have life <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.</p>
 <p>13. 'And again, O king, just as the tortoise, when, as he swims on the water and raises his head, he catches sight of any one, that moment sinks, and dives into the depths, lest they should see him again; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when evil inclinations fall upon him, sink into the waters of meditation, dive down into the deeps thereof, lest those evil inclinations should catch sight of him again.

This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.</p>
 <p>15. 'And again, O king, just as the tortoise, digging a hole in the ground, dwells alone; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, giving up worldly gain and honour and praise, take up his abode alone, plunging into the solitudes of empty lonely places in the groves and woods and hills, in caves and grottoes, noiseless and quiet. This, O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena, the Elder, of the sons of the Va<u>n</u>gantas:</p><dir>

This, O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Sa<i>m</i>yutta Nikâya, in the Sutta of the parable of the tortoise:</p><dir>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the monkey, when about to take up his abode does so in some such place as a mighty tree, in a lonely place covered all over with branches, a sure place of refuge; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, choose as the teacher under whom to live a man modest, amiable, righteous, of beauty of character, learned in tradition and in the scriptures, lovable, venerable, worthy of</p>

 <p>22. 'And again, O king, as the monkey wanders about, and stands and sits, always on trees, and, if he goes to sleep, spends the night on them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, stand and walk up and down thinking, [<b>374</b>] and lie down, and sleep, in the forest, and there enjoy the sense of self-possession. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the monkey he ought to have. For it has been said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>

 <p><a name="fn_673"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_682">277:1</a> The published text carries the details of these similes no further than this. See the remarks in the Introduction, pp. xxiv, xxv.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_674"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_683">278:1</a> <i>G</i>ambuka-sigâliyâ. In <i>G</i>âtaka, No. 294, of Fausböll, the jackal is male. The reference therefore here is to a kind of jackal named after the <i>G</i>ambu fruit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_675"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_684">278:2</a> <i>K</i>a<u>n</u>gavârakassa. See Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 142-4, and <i>G</i>âtaka, V, 186, in both of which passages the Burmese MSS. read <i>k</i>a<u>n</u>ka-. The Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 540, has perahan ka<i>d</i>ê.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_676"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_685">279:1</a> <i>K</i>atukke and singhâ<i>t</i>ake. I follow Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê in the distinction he makes between the meaning of these terms--satara and tun ma<i>m</i> sandhiyehi (p. 540).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_677"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_686">279:2</a> Yogî yogava<i>k</i>aro. The rendering of these words is quite adequate, and has given me much trouble. Neither 'yogee' nor 'devotee' can be used, for they both have acquired connotations contradictory to what was in our author's mind. He means the Buddhist Bhikshu belonging to that class among the Bhikshus (by no means the majority) who had devoted themselves to a life of systematic effort according to the Buddhist scheme of self-training. But I have found it impossible to put into any English phrase sufficiently short for the constant repetition of the two Pâli words any full and accurate representation of all that they imply. See the note above on p. 43 of the Pâli, and <i>G</i>âtaka, vol. i, p. 303.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_678"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_687">279:3</a> Not traced as yet. Mr. Trenckner prints the passage as <a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a> prose, but it is clearly two verses with a slight corruption in the first line. The point of the verses lies in the untranslateable pun of the words upadhâna, 'pillow,' and padhâna, 'strenuous fight.' The word etarahi seems to me suspect, and some such reading as ka<i>l</i>i<u>n</u>garopadhânâ va would restore the metre, and at the same time bring the play on the words more into prominence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_679"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_688">280:1</a> This verse is found in the Thera Gâthâ, No. 985. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê takes the na in the first line as a negative to abhivassati, and translates, 'So long as it does not rain knee-deep on him, when sitting in meditation, what cares the Bhikshu, who is bent on attaining Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, for ease!'--and this is, I think, preferable to Mr. Trenckner's division of the words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_680"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_689">280:2</a> That is, 'filtered;' perahâ nagâ tabâ, says the Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 541.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_681"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_690">280:3</a> Sarîra<i>m</i> pa<i>t</i>i<i>g</i>aggitvâ, 'rested a little to remove the weariness of his body,' says the Si<i>m</i>halese here, but adds below, § 4, siwuru hnda.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_682"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_691">282:1</a> Not traced as yet. The verse is a riddle based on two parables. Of these the first is already published in the Samyutta Nikâya XII, 63, 5-8. It tells of a father and mother who in the desert (and of course only with the object of keeping themselves alive) ate their only child. The other is not yet published, but Mr. Trenckner points out that it occurs in the 34th Samyutta. Oiling wheels is done solely to keep the cart going. Compare the dying Buddha's comparison of himself to a worn-out cart, which can only with difficulty be made to move along. Like that, the body of the Tathâgata can only with difficulty be kept a little longer going ('Buddhist Suttas,' p. 37).</p>
 <p>As to the last word, I take it, with Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 542, to be mu<i>kkh</i>ito, and not amu<i>kkh</i>ito as is printed in the text. That is also the reading adopted by Fausböll at <i>G</i>âtaka II, 294, where the verses are quoted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_683"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_692">282:2</a> Na nimitta<i>m</i> gahetabba<i>m</i> nânubya<i>ñg</i>ana<i>m</i> gahetabba<i>m</i>. On these common expressions compare A<u>n</u>guttara I, 2, 6, &amp;c.; Puggala Pa<i>ññ</i>atti II, 17, IV, 24, &amp;c.; Dîgha II, 64, &amp;c.; and Buddhaghosa as quoted in 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 9. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê only repeats the first, but explains the second by nwata nwata wimasîme<i>m</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_684"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_693">283:1</a> From Thera Gâthâ. The Si<i>m</i>halese supports Mr. Trenckner in reading <i>g</i>ivhâv' in line three, but on the other hand has (twice) mana-sâyika<i>m</i> for mata-sâyika<i>m</i>. For the last line, of which a literal translation is impossible, it says, 'Let him make his couch on, fix his attention on, that Nirvâ<i>n</i>a which is mana-sâyika-<i>k</i>itta.' I think mata is the right reading, and that very possibly a riddle or pun is intended on the two meanings of that word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_685"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_694">283:2</a> Paripâtiyanto. See above, p. 279 of the Pâli, and <i>G</i>âtaka II, 208. The Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 543, has he<i>l</i>anu labanneya.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_691"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_700">284:2</a> Not traced as yet. It is not included in the collection of Sâriputta's verses preserved in the Thera Gâthâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_693"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_702">285:1</a> Dîpinî, perhaps 'leopardess.' The Si<i>m</i>halese has 'tigress,' which is certainly wrong.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_694"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_703">285:2</a> Because it realises the pains and sorrows of cub-bearing, says the Si<i>m</i>halese.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_696"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_705">286:1</a> That is, of course, Arahatship. The lines are not to be found in the published texts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_697"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_706">286:2</a> Sinâna-dâneria; omitted by the Sutta Vibhanga and by Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê (who quotes the Pâli of this passage).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_698"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_707">287:1</a> Muggasuppatâ. So Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 546. The Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga omits both this word and the next.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_699"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_708">287:2</a> Pâribha<i>tt</i>akatâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_700"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_709">287:3</a> <i>G</i>a<u>n</u>gha-pesaniyena. The Sutta Vibhanga I, 185, on which our whole paragraph here is based, reads -pesanikena. I have differentiated the three sorts of messages according to the Si<i>m</i>halese.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_701"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_710">287:4</a> Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, both in his transcription of the Pâli (p. 546) and in his translation (p. 547), reads pahîna-gamana.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_702"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_711">287:5</a> Anuppadâna. Compare <i>G</i>âtaka III, 205. At Sigâlovâda Sutta, p. 307, and Milinda, p. 315, it means simply providing a person with things he wants. Childers's rendering, 'giving,' is inadequate in all the passages.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_703"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_712">287:6</a> Referring to the Sîlas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_704"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_713">288:1</a> Not traced as yet. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê gives a long account of the circumstances under which these verses were spoken. Sâriputta was ill. Moggallâna asked him what would be good for him to take. Sâriputta told him. His friend then, by intervention of the king of the gods, procured it. But Sâriputta refused to make use of it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_707"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_716">290:1</a> The parable is in the 46th Samyutta. The verses are already published at vol. i, p. 7 of M. Feer's edition for the Pâli Text Society.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_708"></a><a href="sbe3609.htm#fr_717">291:1</a> Not traced as yet. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê reads samuttarim.</p>
