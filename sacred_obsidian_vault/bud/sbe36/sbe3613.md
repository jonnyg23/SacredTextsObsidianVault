 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those seven qualities of the lion you say he ought to have, which are they?'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the lion is of a clear, stainless, and pure light yellow colour; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be clear, stainless, and pure light in mind, free from anger and moroseness. This, O king, is the first quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>2. 'And again, O king, as the lion has four paws as his means of travelling, and is rapid in his gait; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, move along the four paths of saintship. This, O king, is the second quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>3. 'And again, O king, as the lion has a beautiful coat of hair, pleasant to behold; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have a beautiful coat of righteousness, pleasant to behold. This, O king, is the third quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>4. 'And again, O king, as the lion, even were his life to cease, bows down before no man; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, even though he should cease to obtain all the requisites of a recluse--food and clothing and lodging and medicine for the sick--never bow down</p>

 <p>to any man <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This is the fourth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>5. 'And again, O king, as the lion eats regularly on, wheresoever his prey falls there does he eat whatever he requires, and seeks not out the best morsels of flesh; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, stand for alms at each hut in regular order, not seeking out the families where he would be given better food, not missing out any house upon his rounds <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he should not pick and choose in eating, wheresoever he may have received a mouthful of rice there should he eat it, seeking not for the best morsels. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>6. 'And again, O king, as the lion is not a storer up of what he eats, and when he has once eaten of his prey returns not again to it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never be a storer up of food. This is the sixth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
 <p>7. [<b>401</b>] 'And again, O king, as the lion, even if he gets no food, is not alarmed, and if he does <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">3</font></a>, then he eats it without craving, without faintness, without sinking <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">4</font></a>; just so, O king, should the</p>

 <p>strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be not alarmed even if he gets no food, and if he does then should he eat it without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of the danger in the lust of taste, in full knowledge of the right outcome of eating (the maintenance of life for the pursuit of holiness) <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This, O king, is the seventh quality of the lion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta Nikâya, when he was exalting Mahâ Kassapa, the Elder:</p>
 <p>"This Kassapa, O Bhikshus, is content with such food as he receives, he magnifies the being content with whatever food one gets, he is not guilty of anything improper or unbecoming for the sake of an alms, if he receive none, yet is he not alarmed, and if he does then does he eat it without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of danger, with full knowledge of the right object in taking food <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">2</font></a>."'</p>

 <p>9. 'And again, O king, as the <i>K</i>akravâka bird feeds on the Sevâla and Pa<i>n</i>aka (water-plants so called), and derives satisfaction therefrom, and being so satisfied, neither his strength nor his beauty grows less; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, find satisfaction in whatever he receives. And if he does so find satisfaction, O king, then does he decrease neither in power of meditation, nor in wisdom, nor in emancipation, nor in the insight that arises from the consciousness of emancipation, nor in any kind of goodness. [<b>402</b>] This, O king, is the second quality of the <i>K</i>akravâka bird he ought to have.</p>
 <p>10. 'And again, O king, as the <i>K</i>akravâka bird does no harm to living things; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, laying aside the cudgel, laying aside the sword, be full of modesty and pity, compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

 <p>'Just, O king, as the Pe<i>n</i>âhikâ bird, through jealousy of her mate, refuses to nourish her young <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">3</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be jealous of any evil dispositions</p>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the house-pigeon, while dwelling in the abode of others, of men, does not become enamoured of anything that belongs to them, but remains neutral, taking notice only of things pertaining to birds; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, while resorting to other people's houses, never become enamoured of women or of men, of beds, or chairs, or garments, or jewelry, or things for use or enjoyment, or various forms of food that are there, but remain neutral always, addicted only to such ideas as become a recluse. This, O king, is the quality of the house-pigeon he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the <i>K</i>ulla <i>N</i>ânada <i>G</i>âtaka:</p><dir>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the bat, though it enters into men's dwelling-places, and flies about in them, soon goes out from them, delays not therein; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he has entered the village for alms, and gone on his rounds in regular order, depart quickly with the alms he has received, and delay not therein. This, O king, is the first quality of the bat he ought to have.</p>
 <p>18. 'And again, O king, as the bat, while frequenting other folk's houses, does them no harm; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when visiting the houses of the laity, never give them cause for vexation by persistent requests, or by pointing out what he wants, or by wrong demeanour, or by chattering, or by being indifferent to their prosperity or adversity; he should never take them away from their chief business occupations, but desire their success in all things.

 <p>'Just, O king, as the leech, wheresoever it is put on, there does it adhere firmly, drinking the blood; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on whatsoever subject for meditation he may fix his mind, call that subject firmly up before him in respect of its colour, and shape, and position, and extension, and boundaries, and nature, and characteristic marks, drinking the delicious draught of the ambrosia of emancipation. This, O king, is the quality of the leech he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</p><dir>

 <p>'Just, O king, as the serpent progresses by means of its belly; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, progress by means of his knowledge. For the heart of the recluse, O king, who progresses by knowledge, continues in perception (of the four Truths), that which is inconsistent with the characteristics of a recluse <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">1</font></a> does he put away, that which is consistent with them does he develop in himself.

 <p>'Just, O king, as the rock-snake, immense as is its length of body, will go many days with empty belly, and, wretched get no food to fill its stomach, yet in spite of that it will just manage to keep itself alive; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though he be addicted to obtaining his food by alms, dependent on the gifts that others may give, awaiting offers, abstaining from taking anything himself, and find it difficult to get his belly's-full, yet should he, if he seek after the highest good <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">3</font></a>, even though he receive not so much as four or five mouthfuls to eat, fill up the void by water.

Both these forms are to be derived, I venture to think, from <i>G</i>YÂ (or its more primitive form <i>G</i>Î), and not from <i>G</i>I. It is true that Childers gives <i>g</i>inâti as third person singular of <i>G</i>I, and that (through the influence of the <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a> common word <i>G</i>ina) there has really, perhaps, been some confusion in Pâli writers between the two roots, closely allied as they are both in form and meaning. But whether or not that be so elsewhere, we have here at least another instance of the frequent association of a simple verb with its own causal. <i>G</i>âpeti, which occurs three times in the Milinda, and is always explained by Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê in the same way (see my notes above on pp. 171, 227 of the Pâli; here he has artha-hâni no karawâ da), i neither for <i>gh</i>âpeti (as Dr. Edward Müller suggests in his grammar, p. 37) nor for <i>g</i>âpayati, but for <i>g</i>yâpayati. For the apparent confusion between <i>G</i>I, <i>g</i>ayati, 'conquer,' and <i>G</i>YÂ, ginâti, (1) 'overcome, bring into subjection,' (2) 'oppress, extort,' see the commentary on <i>g</i>ine at Dhammapada, verse 103 (quoted also at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 314), which runs <i>g</i>initvâna <i>g</i>aya<i>m</i> âhareyya; and on gaya<i>m</i> at Verse 201 (taken from Samyutta III, 2, 4, 7), which is explained by <i>g</i>inanto, and at verse 104 where <i>g</i>ita<i>m</i> is explained by <i>g</i>inâti. But in Pi<i>t</i>aka texts I know of no instance where the two roots cannot be kept quite distinct; and it is quite possible that the Dhammapada commentator, while interpreting the one root by the other, is still conscious of the difference between them. <i>G</i>îna (the p. p. p. of <i>g</i>inâti) is not given at all by Childers, but occurs <i>G</i>âtaka III, 153, 223, 335; V, 99.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_799"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_808">342:2</a> The Si<i>m</i>halese (p. 600) has kndttiya, a word not in Clough.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_800"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_809">342:3</a> Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê's translation of this clause shows that he had a different reading in his Pâli text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_801"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_810">343:1</a> 'As the Pe<i>n</i>âhikâ, refusing to nourish her young in the nest, puts them into a crevice of a tree, and watches them there,' is the Si<i>m</i>halese interpretation. And the word susira would not have been used in the second clause unless something corresponding to it had originally stood also in the first.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_802"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_811">343:2</a> Here again it is probable from the Si<i>m</i>halese version that Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê reads ratti<i>m</i> for rati<i>m</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_803"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_812">343:3</a> The verse occurs in the Thera Gâthâ 142, but is here quoted from the Samyutta Nikâya VI, 2, 3, 4, where the readings sa<i>k</i>e <i>k</i>a . . . . . nâdhiga<i>kkh</i>aye . . . . . satimâ must be corrected according to the readings here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_804"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_813">344:1</a> <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 223. There is a difference of reading, making no difference to the sense; and the words are put into the mouth, not of the Buddha, but of the old ascetic, the Bodisat of the story.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_805"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_814">345:1</a> Not traced as yet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_806"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_815">345:2</a> Satapatto, literally the hundred-feathered one,' Si<i>m</i>halese krl, quite different from the ordinary crane (bako), This one was a bird of ill omen. See <i>G</i>âtaka II, 153 foll.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_807"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_816">346:1</a> Not traced as yet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_808"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_817">347:1</a> This is from the 30th Sutta in the Dîgha Nikâya, where it occurs in the description of the Bodisat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_809"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_818">347:2</a> Not traced as yet. Childers translates ase<i>k</i>ana by 'charming,' &amp;c., apparently on the authority of Subhûti's English gloss on Abhidhâna Padîpikâ 597. But that meaning is rather the point of union between all the synonyms given in the verse, and not the exact meaning of each of them. The word, either in its simple form, or with an added -ka, occurs in Therâ Gâthâ 55; Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 114.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_810"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_819">348:1</a> Vilakkha<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>, not found elsewhere. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 604, renders it simply 'dullness' (moha).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_811"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_820">348:2</a> 'Goes slanting, avoiding medicinal plants, trees, &amp;c.,' says the Si<i>m</i>halese.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_812"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_821">348:3</a> <i>K</i>intayati, perhaps 'put out.' Glawî yanta sitanneya, says the Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 60.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_813"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_822">349:1</a> <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 439.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_823">349:2</a> A<i>g</i>agara. Childers renders this 'boa-constrictor.' But Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê has pimburâ, which is a rock-snake, often confounded with the boa-constrictor on account of the size to which it grows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_815"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_824">349:3</a> Atthavasikena, attha being rendered Nirvâ<i>n</i>a by the Si<i>m</i>halese.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_816"></a><a href="sbe3613.htm#fr_825">350:1</a> Thera Gâthâ 982, 983. The next verse but one has been already quoted above, p. 366 of the Pâli; and these recur at <i>G</i>âtaka II, 293, 294.</p>
