 <p>"<i>Who sagely meditates</i>."--This story too was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the Elder Sāriputta at the gate of Saṁkassa.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
 <p>Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, answered his disciples' enquiries with the words--"Moonlight and Sunlight." With these words he died and passed to the Radiant Realm.</p>  
 <p>Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Master's words his fellows did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air recited this stanza:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Who sagely meditates on sun and moon,<br> Shall win (when Reason unto Ecstasy<br> Gives place) his after-lot in Radiant Realms <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</div>  
 <p>Such was the Bodhisatta's teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he went his way back to the Brahma Realm.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
 <p>His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "Sāriputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I Mahā-Brahmā."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_191"></a><a href="j1138.htm#fr_192">292:1</a> These technical lines imply that, by taking the Sun and Moon as his <i>kammaṭṭhāna</i>, or subject for meditation, a Buddhist, by attaining Jhāna (or Insight) in the second (<i>i.e.</i> supra-rational) degree, can save himself from re-birth in a lower sphere of existence than the Ābhassaraloka or Radiant Realm of the corporeal Brahma-world.</p>
