 <p>Basho said to his disciple: "When you have a staff, I will give it to you. If you have no staff, I will take it away from you."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> When there is no bridge over the creek the staff will help me. When I return home on a moonless night the staff will accompany me. But if you call this a staff, you will enter hell like an arrow. </p>
