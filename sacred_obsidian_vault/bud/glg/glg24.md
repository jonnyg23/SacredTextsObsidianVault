 <p>A monk asked Fuketsu: "Without speaking, without silence, how can you express the truth?"</p>  
 <p>Fuketsu observed: "I always remember springtime in southern China. The birds sing among innumerable kinds of fragrant flowers."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Fuketsu used to have lightning Zen. Whenever he had the opportunity, he flashed it. But this time he failed to do so and only borrowed from an old Chinese poem. Never mind Fuketsu's Zen. If you want to express the truth, throw out your words, throw out your silence, and tell me about your own Zen.</p>
