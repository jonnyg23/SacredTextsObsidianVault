 <p>Hyakujo wished to send a monk to open a new monastery. He told his pupils that whoever answered a question most ably would be appointed. Placing a water vase on the ground, he asked: "Who can say what this is without calling its name?"</p>  
 <p>The chief monk said: "No one can call it a wooden shoe."</p>  
 <p>Isan, the cooking monk, tipped over the vase with his foot and went out.</p>  
 <p>Hyakujo smiled and said: "The chief monk loses." And Isan became the master of the new monastery.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Isan was brave enough, but he could not escape Hyakujo's trick. After all, he gave up a light job and took a heavy one. Why, can't you see, he took off his comfortable hat and placed himself in iron stocks.</p>
