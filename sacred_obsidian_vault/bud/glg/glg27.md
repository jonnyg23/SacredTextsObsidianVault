 <p>A monk asked Nansen: "Is there a teaching no master ever preached before?"</p>  
 <p>Nansen said: "Yes, there is."</p>  
 <p>"What is it?" asked the monk.</p>  
 <p>Nansen replied: "It is not mind, it is not Buddha, it is not things."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Old Nansen gave away his treasure-words. He must have been greatly upset.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><i>Nansen was too kind and lost his treasure.<br> Truly, words have no power</i>. <br> <i>Even though the mountain becomes the sea,<br> Words cannot open another's mind</i>.</div>
