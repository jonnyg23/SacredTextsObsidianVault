 <p>Bodhidharma sits facing the wall. His future successor stands in the snow and presents his severed  arm to Bodhidharma. He cries: "My mind is not pacified. Master, pacify my mind."</p>  
 <p>Bodhidharma says: "If you bring me that mind, I will pacify it for you."</p>  
 <p>The successor says: "When I search my mind I cannot hold it."</p>  
 <p>Bodhidharma says: "Then your mind is pacified already."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> That broken-toothed old Hindu, Bodhidharma, came thousands of miles over the sea from India to China as if he had something wonderful. He is like raising waves without wind. After he remained years in China he had only one disciple and that one lost his arm and was deformed. Alas, ever since he has had brainless disciples.</p>
