So the Sa<i>m</i>gha carried out against <i>Kh</i>anna the Bhikkhu the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging a fault to the effect that he should not at or dwell together with the Sa<i>m</i>gha. And after he had been subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging his fault he went from that residence to another residence.
