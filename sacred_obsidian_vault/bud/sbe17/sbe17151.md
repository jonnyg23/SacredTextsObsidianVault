 <p>[In this chapter the same rules for the Mânatta, or Penance, are laid down word for word as those in chapter 1, §§ 1, 2, 3, and 4, for the probation, reading throughout 'Bhikkhus who are going through the Mânatta discipline' for 'Bhikkhus who have been placed under probation.' There are, however, one or two minor points of difference, which are as follows:</p>  
 <p>1. At the end of the announcements (chapter 1,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 395</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> § 2) there is inserted the injunction, 'He ought to announce the fact every day.'</p>  
 <p>2. In the passages about going from one residence to another (chapter 1, § 3) read 'unless with the Sa<i>m</i>gha' instead of 'unless with a regular Bhikkhu.'] <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_708"></a><a href="sbe17151.htm#fr_726">395:1</a> It will be seen, therefore, that there is very little, one might almost say no practical, difference between the Parivâsa, which we have rendered 'probation,' and the Mânatta, which we have usually left untranslated, and sometimes rendered 'penance.' Neither the one nor the other are at present enforced anywhere among the Buddhists.</p>
