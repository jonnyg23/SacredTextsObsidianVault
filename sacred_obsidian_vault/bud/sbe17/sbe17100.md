 <p>1. At that time the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampâ performed official acts in the following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed unlawful acts before a complete congregation; they performed lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete congregation; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a single one; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against two; a single Bhikkhu</p>

 <p>pronounced expulsion against a number of Bhikkhus; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a Sa<i>m</i>gha; two Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . . against a number of Bhikkhus . . . . against a Sa<i>m</i>gha; a number of Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . . against another number . . . . against a Sa<i>m</i>gha; a Sa<i>m</i>gha pronounced expulsion against another Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampâ perform official acts in the following ways: perform unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation (&amp;c., down to:) how can a Sa<i>m</i>gha pronounce expulsion against another Sa<i>m</i>gha?'</p>  
 <p>These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampâ perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c.?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing; it is unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c. This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>3. 'If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>unlawfully by an incomplete congregation, it is no real act <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">1</font></a> and ought not to be performed. An official act performed unlawfully by a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to:). A seemingly lawful act performed before a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed. In case a single Bhikkhu pronounces expulsion against a single one,--this is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c., down to:). In case a Sa<i>m</i>gha pronounces expulsion against another Sa<i>m</i>gha,--this is no real act and ought not to be performed.</p>  
 <p>4. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, four kinds of official acts (which a Sa<i>m</i>gha can perform); an unlawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, an unlawful act performed by a complete congregation, a lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, and a lawful act performed by a complete congregation.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by an incomplete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of its unlawfulness and of the incompleteness (of the congregation). Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought not to be performed, nor is such an act allowed by me.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by a complete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of its unlawfulness. Such an act, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by an incomplete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p>the incompleteness (of the congregation). Such an act, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by a complete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is unobjectionable and valid on account of its lawfulness and of the completeness (of the congregation). Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought to be performed, and such an act is allowed by me.</p>  
 <p>'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, you ought to train yourselves thus: "Lawful acts which are performed by complete congregations--such acts will we perform <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p>
