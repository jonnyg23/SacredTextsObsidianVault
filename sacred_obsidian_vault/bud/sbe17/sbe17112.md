 <p>1. At that time the Blessed One was staying at <i>G</i>etavana, in the grove of Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and of Lohitaka <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--who themselves were makers of strife, quarrelsome <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">2</font></a>, makers of disputes <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">3</font></a>, given to idle talk, and raisers of legal questions in the Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">4</font></a>,--used to go up to such other Bhikkhus as were the same, and say, 'Do not allow such a one, venerable Sirs, to turn you back. Discuss loud and long. You are indeed cleverer, more wise, more well informed, more able at that (than</p>

 <p>your adversaries are) and do not you be afraid of them. We too will be on your side.' Thereby both disputes arose which had not arisen before; and disputes which had arisen grew hotter.</p>  
 <p>2. Those Bhikkhus who were modest were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, How can the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and of Lohitaka act thus.' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Order of Bhikkhus, and inquired of the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, as they say, Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and Lohitaka,--who themselves (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to the end)?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus, for those foolish persons, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, who themselves (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to the end). This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted being not converted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
 <p>3. And when the Blessed One had rebuked those Bhikkhus in various ways,--speaking of the evils of being hard to satisfy in the matter of support or nourishment, of wishing for much, of discontent, of love of society, and of sloth; and speaking in praise of being easy to satisfy in the matter of support and nourishment, of wishing for little, of the</p>

 <p>4. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and Lohitaka ought to be warned; when they have been warned, they ought to be reminded (of the Rule in the Pâtimokkha against which they have offended); when they have been reminded, they ought to be charged with the (particular) offence; when they have been charged with the offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>
