 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sâvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove. And at that time about thirty Pâ<i>th</i>eyyaka Bhikkhus <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>who were all dwellers in the forest, all living on alms, all dressed in rags from the dust heap, all having only three robes each, when they were on the way to Sâvatthi to visit the Blessed One, at the time when the period for entering upon Vassa was at hand, were unable to reach Sâvatthi in time to spend the Vassa there, and stayed at Sâketa on the way for the Vassa. And they spent the period of Vassa in discomfort, thinking, 'Our Blessed One is staying near us, six leagues from here, and we are not able to visit the Blessed One.'</p>  
 <p>And when, after three months, those Bhikkhus had completed their Vassa residence, and had held their Pavâra<i>n</i>â, they went on to the place where the Blessed One was, at Sâvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove, while the rain was falling, and the waters were gathering <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the swamps were forming, and their robes were all drenched, and they were weary. And when they had arrived, they saluted the Blessed One, and took their seats on one side.</p>  
 <p>2. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas to greet kindly Bhikkhus who have just arrived. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>  
 <p>Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhus? Do</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>you get enough to support yourselves with? Have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and have you not suffered from want of food?'</p>  
 <p>'Things go well with us, Lord; we get enough to support ourselves with, Lord; we have kept Vassa, Lord, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and have not suffered from want of food. When we were on our way, Lord, about thirty Pâ<i>th</i>eyyaka Bhikkhus, to Sâvatthi to visit the Blessed One, we were unable to reach Sâvatthi in time (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to:). And when, after three months, Lord, we had completed our Vassa residence, and had held our Pavâra<i>n</i>â, we have made our way, while the rain was falling, and the waters were gathering, and the swamps were forming; and our robes were all drenched; and we have become weary.'</p>  
 <p>3. Then the Blessed One in that connection, having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">1</font></a>:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony shall be performed by Bhikkhus when</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>they have completed their Vassa. And five things are allowable to you, O Bhikkhus, after the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony has been held--going for alms to the houses of people who have not invited you <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">1</font></a>, going</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>for alms without wearing the usual set of three robes <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">1</font></a>, going for alms in a body of four or more <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">2</font></a>, possessing as many robes as are wanted <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and whatever number of robes shall have come to hand, that shall belong to them (that is, to the Bhikkhus entitled, by residence and otherwise, to share in the distribution  <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">4</font></a>).</p>  
 <p>'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the Ka<i>th</i>ina to be dedicated.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_271">146:1</a> Buddhaghosa says, Pâ<i>th</i>eyya (the Berlin MS. reads Pâveyya) is the name of a kingdom situated to the west of the Kosala country. This passage refers to Bhikkhus who dwelt there. The Bhattavaggiya Theras (so the Berlin MS.; query Satta-vaggiya), who were brothers of the Kosala king, sons of the same father, are here alluded to.'</p>  
 <p>But with which of the many kingdoms 'to the west of the Kosala country' are we to identify Pâ<i>th</i>eyya? The word does not occur in the stock list, found in different parts of the Pâli Pi.itakas, of the sixteen Mahâ-<i>g</i>anapadâ; that is to say, Aṅga, Magadha, Kâsi, Kosala, Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>i, Malla, <i>K</i>etiya, Va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, Kuru, Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âla, Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a, Sûrasena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhâra, Kambo<i>g</i>a. The account of the Council at Vesâlî gives us a hint as to the right answer to the above question; for the Thera Sambhûta, who took part in that Council, is called a Pâ<i>th</i>eyyaka in <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 2, 7, and is also said at <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 8 to have lived Ahogaṅge Pabbate. The position of this hill is further described in the Mahâva<i>m</i>sa as being on the upper Ganges--uddhagaṅgâya . . . . Ahogaṅgamhi pabbate (p. 39, ed. Turnour). Then again in <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 7 the Thera Yasa, when wishing to put himself in communication with the Bhikkhus in Pâ<i>th</i>eyya and in other places, goes to Kosambî as the most convenient meeting-place for Bhikkhus coming from the East. The other places mentioned in that passage in juxta-position with Pâ<i>th</i>eyya would seem to show that Pâ<i>th</i>eyya, with Pâ<i>k</i>îna, Avanti, and Dakkhi<i>n</i>âpatha, is one of the principal divisions into which India, as then known, was divided; and that it includes most, if not all, of the great westerly kingdoms of <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a> Kuru, Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âla, &amp;c., which are the last eight of the sixteen kingdoms in the stock list above referred to. Probably the literal meaning of Pâ<i>th</i>eyya is 'western' (Sans. pratya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>). In the Suttavibhaṅga (Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya 34) merchants are mentioned who are travelling from Râ<i>g</i>agaha to the Pa<i>t</i>iyâloka, which must mean 'the western country,' just as Pa<i>t</i>iyârâma (Dîpav. 17, 11) means 'the western Ârâma.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_269"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_273">147:2</a> Compare IV, I, 8, and foll.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_270"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_274">148:1</a> As has been remarked in a previous note (to the first Nissaggiya Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya Rule) some of the details of these Ka<i>th</i>ina ordinances are at present difficult to understand. But the general meaning of them is already clear. Immediately after the Pavâra<i>n</i>â, the ceremony by which the Vassa residence is closed, there follows a distribution of the robes belonging to the local Sa<i>m</i>gha, (that is, the portion of the Order dwelling within one boundary,) to the particular Bhikkhus composing the Sa<i>m</i>gha. This distribution commences with the ka<i>th</i>in-atthâra, atthâra, 'spreading out,' not being used here literally for spreading out on the ground or otherwise, but in a secondary, juristic sense. And the act performed receives the technical name atthâra by a process of putting a part for the whole, the spreading out in the sun (see our note, <a href="sbe17005.htm#page_18">p. 18</a>) for the whole ceremony. We translate the term according to the context, sometimes by 'spreading out,' sometimes by 'ceremony,' sometimes by 'dedication.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_%6049"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. `49</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Ka<i>th</i>ina, literally 'hard,' is the stock of cotton cloth provided by the faithful to be made up into robes for the use of the Sa<i>m</i>gha during the ensuing year. The whole of this cotton cloth must be dyed, sewn together, and made into robes, and then formally declared to be (not only common property, Sa<i>m</i>ghika, but) available for immediate distribution--all on one and the same day. The object of this was that the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or at least a quorum of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, being able to be present throughout, there would be less chance of any mistake by which what was intended equally for all might come to be unequally divided among a few. All the Brethren who have kept their Vassa within the limits of the district within which the particular Sa<i>m</i>gha lives (and therefore technically called an âvâsa, 'residence'), and who have taken part in the Pavâra<i>n</i>â, are entitled to share in the distribution.</p>  
 <p>(Buddhaghosa says, 'Ettha kathinatthâra<i>m</i> ke labhanti ke na labhanti. Ga<i>n</i>avasena tâva pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ima-ko<i>t</i>iyâ pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a <i>g</i>anâ (for at least five must be present to make a Pavâra<i>n</i>â legal, Mahâvagga IX, 4, r) . . . . vu<i>t</i><i>th</i>avassavasena purimikâya vassa<i>m</i> upagantvâ pa<i>th</i>ama-pavâra<i>n</i>âya pavâritâ labhanti.')</p>  
 <p>There can of course be no ka<i>th</i>in-atthâra if there is no ka<i>th</i>ina; and, under certain restrictions laid down in the Nissaggiya Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya Rules, laymen were allowed to give robes for the special use of a particular Bhikkhu. If, however, a layman was desirous of giving the much more meritorious gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina to the whole community, then he is to present the cloth in the early morning to a properly constituted meeting of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony has to be gone through. All the Brethren living within the boundary have to be present, and to take part in the work of making the cotton cloth up into robes; and if there is any danger of the work not being concluded before the day is over, even the most senior Bhikkhus, or the most revered for their learning or insight, must lend a hand. Then follows the distribution so far only as is set forth in the next section (§ 4) and in the note to it.</p>  
 <p>Now it would often happen that, at the end of the rainy season of Vassa, the last year's robes of some of the Bhikkhus would be worn out. And yet no laymen would come forward to give a Ka<i>th</i>ina until some time after the Vassa residence had closed. But <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a> if any one did offer a Ka<i>th</i>ina, and the ceremony was duly performed, then each Bhikkhu had a right to supply his actual needs from the robes made out of the Ka<i>th</i>ina. He need not do so at once. His want might not be pressing, or might not even arise till afterwards. During such an interval the five privileges (Anisa<i>m</i>sâ) mentioned in this section (§ 3) are accorded to the Bhikkhus, though they would be against the rules in force during the rest of the year.</p>  
 <p>But if the Bhikkhu kept on postponing his choice would the privileges accorded by this section hold good even during the whole year? Could the Bhikkhu, by his mere abstention, thus bring about a practical abrogation of the general rules? Not so, for the five privileges are in their turn suspended by any one of the eight things mentioned below in § 7.</p>  
 <p>We may add that at the present time in Burma and Ceylon, the robes for the Bhikkhus are usually provided in accordance with the rules regulating gifts to particular Bhikkhus. But the gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina is still by no means uncommon. See Spence Hardy's 'Eastern Monachism,' pp. 121 and foll. There is probably, however, very seldom any necessity for the Bhikkhus to avail themselves of any of the five privileges, except the last.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_271"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_275">150:1</a> This privilege is one of the exceptions allowed, in the Pâtimokkha, to the 46th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya. Bhikkhus were allowed, as a general rule, to pass through a village, with their alms-bowls in their hands, in order to give any disciple who wished to do so the opportunity of giving them food. (To describe this procedure by our word 'begging,' as is so often done, is, to say the least, misleading.) The 46th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya lays down, in certain circumstances, a restriction on this general rule. The present section removes that restriction during the period of Ka<i>th</i>in-atthâra; in order, according to Buddhaghosa (see the note on Pâ<i>k</i>. 46), to prevent the stock of robes falling short. That is, apparently, with the hope that a freer intercourse than usual between Bhikkhus and laity might lead to a gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina when it was urgently required.</p>  
 <p>Here Buddhaghosa says simply, 'Anâmanta-<i>k</i>âro ’ti yâva ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> na uddhariyati tâva anâmantetvâ: Âmanteti must be equal to âpu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati. Compare Böhtlingk-Roth under âmantra<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_272"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_276">151:1</a> This privilege is granted as a relaxation of the 2nd Nissaggiya. Buddhaghosa says, 'Asamâdâna-<i>k</i>âro ’ti ti-<i>k</i>ivara<i>m</i> asamâdâya <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> <i>k</i>îvara-vippavâso kappissatîti attho.' Compare Mahâvagga VIII, 23, 3. It will be seen that the wording of the Pâtimokkha Rule is not inconsistent with the rule laid down here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_277">151:2</a> This is a relaxation of the 32nd Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya, and is mentioned in that rule.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_274"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_278">151:3</a> This would seem to be a relaxation of the 1st Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya. Though it is not referred to there in terms, it is implied in the clause by which the operation of the rule is postponed till after the Ka<i>th</i>ina has been 'taken up,' i.e. till each Bhikkhu has actually received his share, or otherwise lost his claim to it. Till that has taken place, a Bhikkhu may use (temporarily, and without actually appropriating them) as many robes as he likes. B. says, 'Yâvadattha-<i>k</i>îvaran ti yâvatâ <i>k</i>ivarena attho tâvataka<i>m</i> anadhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ita<i>m</i> avikappita<i>m</i> (compare Sutta-vibhaṅga Niss. I, 3, 1) kappissatîti attho:</p>
 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_279">151:4</a> That is, according to Buddhaghosa, either those belonging to a Bhikkhu who has died, or those belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha in any way. This shows that at the division not only the robes made out of the gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina were to be included, but whatever robes had not been given as intended specially for some one Bhikkhu. As to the actual practice now in Ceylon, compare Spence Hardy, loc. cit. Buddhaghosa says here: 'Yo <i>k</i>a tattha <i>k</i>îvar-uppâdo tattha ka<i>th</i>inatthata-sîmâya mataka-<i>k</i>îvara<i>m</i> vâ hotu sa<i>m</i>gha<i>m</i> uddissa dinna<i>m</i> vâ sa<i>m</i>ghikena tatr’ uppâdena âbhata<i>m</i> vâ yena kena<i>k</i>i âkârena yam sa<i>m</i>ghika<i>m</i> <i>k</i>îvara<i>m</i> uppa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati ta<i>m</i> tesa<i>m</i> bhavissatîti attho.' The use of the pronoun nesa<i>m</i> at the end of the rule is awkward, following after vo; but the meaning as translated is not open to doubt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_276"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_280">152:1</a> This formula is one of those included in the collection entitled Kammavâ<i>k</i>a<i>m</i>. It appears from Minayeff (Prâtimoksha, pp. 75, 76) that the Bhikkhu so appointed superintends the processes of dyeing, sewing, &amp;c. When the new robes are ready for wear, he lays aside one of his old robes which has been worn out (pa<i>k</i>.uddharitvâ), and chooses for himself one of the new ones (nava<i>m</i> adhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ahitvâ), saying as he does so, 'imâya sa<i>m</i>ghâ<i>t</i>iyâ (or, as the case may be, uttarâsaṅgena, antaravâsakena) ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> attharâmi.' This speech shows the technical application of the verb attharati in this connection. He then points out the remaining robes to the Bhikkhus there present, specifying which he thinks fit for the elder, and which for the younger members of the Order (Theras and Navakas); but not assigning further any particular robes to particular Bhikkhus. Finally he calls upon the Sa<i>m</i>gha for their formal approval of his procedure (compare the closing words of §§5, 6). But when they have given it, the distribution is not at an end. The time has only come when each of the Bhikkhus can transmute his claim to an undivided share into the actual possession of a divided share. Until he does so, the Ka<i>th</i>ina privileges set out in § 3 are allowed to him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_277"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_281">152:2</a> The formal permission to each Bhikkhu to take his share is <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a> not completed by any one of the following acts having been performed. The technical terms of the tailor's craft are, as will be seen, by no means easy to follow.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_279"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_283">153:2</a> Bandhana-mattenâ ’ti mogha-suttak-âropana-mattena (B.). Mogha-suttakâni, 'false threads,' are threads put in the cloth to show where it is to be cut or sewn. See Buddhaghosa on <i>K</i>ullavagga V, II, 3 (p. 317 of H. O.'s edition). Our clause therefore means temporarily pieced together as the commencement of the tailoring work.</p>

Sewn in lengths along the lines of the false threads mentioned in the last note. The word occurs also in Mahâvagga VIII, 14, 2; and in <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 1, 2 we are told that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>ika<i>m</i> dhârenti. Buddhaghosa says there vi<i>g</i><i>gh</i>ita-kara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>ikâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_291">154:5</a> Or perhaps, according to some commentators, when it has been decided to accept the gift as a Ka<i>th</i>ina, that is, when it has been decided that the cloth is of a suitable kind to make robes out of. Buddhaghosa says: Nimitta-katenâ ’ti iminâ dussena ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> attharissâmîti eva<i>m</i> nimittakatena. Ettakam eva Parivâre vutta<i>m</i>.

Compare below, § 6, for this and the two following words, the meaning of which is very doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_292">154:6</a> Buddhaghosa: Parikathâ-katenâ ’ti ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> nâma dâtum va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati, ka<i>th</i>ina-dâyako bahu-pu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> pasavatîti eva<i>m</i> parikathâya uppâditena.

 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="sbe17055.htm#fr_293">154:7</a> Buddhaghosa simply says: kukku-katenâ ’ti tâvakâlikena. The last word means 'only for a time, temporary, on loan;' see <i>G</i>âtaka I, 121, 393, and <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 16, 1; but the explanation is not clear. According to the Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ kukku is a measure of length.</p>
