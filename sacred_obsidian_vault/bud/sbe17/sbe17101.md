 <p>1. At that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus performed official acts in the following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation (&amp;c., as in chap. 2, § 1, down to:) they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete congregation; they performed acts without a <i>ñ</i>atti <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">2</font></a> and with the proclamation (of the kammavâ<i>k</i>â <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">2</font></a>) they performed acts without a proclamation (of the kammavâ<i>k</i>â) and with the <i>ñ</i>atti; they performed acts without a <i>ñ</i>atti and without a proclamation (of the kammavâ<i>k</i>â); they performed acts contrary to the Dhamma; they performed acts contrary to the Vinaya; they performed acts contrary to the doctrine of the Teacher; and they performed acts against which (the Bhikkhus present) protested, which were unlawful, objectionable, and invalid.</p>  
 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> &amp;c. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>  
 <p>It is true, Lord, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>2. 'If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed unlawfully by an incomplete congregation, it is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c. <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">1</font></a>, down to:). If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed against which (the Bhikkhus present) protest, which is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid, this is no real act and ought not to be performed.</p>  
 <p>3. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, six kinds of official acts (which a Sa<i>m</i>gha can perform): an unlawful act, an act performed by an incomplete congregation, an act performed by a complete congregation, a seemingly lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, a seemingly lawful act performed by a complete congregation, a lawful act performed by a complete congregation.</p>  
 <p>'And which, O Bhikkhus, is an unlawful act? If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">2</font></a> with one <i>ñ</i>atti, and does not proclaim a kammavâ<i>k</i>â, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act with two <i>ñ</i>atti and does not proclaim a kammavâ<i>k</i>â . . . . with one kammavâ<i>k</i>â and does not propose a <i>ñ</i>atti . . . . with two</p>

 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p>kammavâ<i>k</i>âs and does not propose a <i>ñ</i>atti, such an act is unlawful.</p>  
 <p>4. 'If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha act with one <i>ñ</i>atti and does not proclaim a kammavâ<i>k</i>â, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a ñatti<i>k</i>atuttha act with two (. . three, . . . . four) <i>ñ</i>attis and does not proclaim a kammavâ<i>k</i>â, such an act is unlawful. If one performs, O Bhikkhus, a <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha act with one kammavâ<i>k</i>â ( . . . . with two, . . . . three, . . . . four kammavâ<i>k</i>âs) and does not propose a <i>ñ</i>atti, such an act is unlawful. Such acts, O Bhikkhus, are called unlawful acts.</p>  
 <p>5. 'And which, O Bhikkhus, is an act of an incomplete congregation?</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act not all Bhikkhus, as many as are entitled to vote, are present, if the <i>kh</i>anda <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">1</font></a> of those who have to declare their <i>kh</i>anda has not been conveyed (to the assembly), and if the Bhikkhus present protest, such an act is performed by an incomplete congregation.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act as many Bhikkhus as are entitled to vote, are present, but if the <i>kh</i>anda of those who have to declare their <i>kh</i>anda has not been conveyed (to the assembly), and if the Bhikkhus present protest, such an act is performed by an incomplete congregation.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act as many Bhikkhus as are entitled to vote, are present, if the <i>kh</i>anda of those who have to declare their <i>kh</i>anda has been conveyed, but if the Bhikkhus present protest, such an act is performed by an incomplete congregation.</p>

 <p>'Such acts, O Bhikkhus, are called acts performed by incomplete congregations.</p>

 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act as many Bhikkhus as are entitled to vote, are present, if the <i>kh</i>anda of those who have to declare their <i>kh</i>anda has been conveyed (to the assembly), and if the Bhikkhus present do not protest, such an act is performed by a complete congregation.</p>  
 <p>If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha act (&amp;c., as in last section).</p>  
 <p>Such acts, O Bhikkhus, are called acts performed by complete congregations.</p>

 <p>If, O Bhikkhus, at a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act the kammavâ<i>k</i>â is proclaimed first and the <i>ñ</i>atti is proposed afterwards, if not all Bhikkhus, as many as are entitled to vote, are present, &amp;c. <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
