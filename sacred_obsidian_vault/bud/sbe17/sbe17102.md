If restoration, O Bhikkhus, had not been granted before to a person, and the Sa<i>m</i>gha grants restoration to him, there are some to whom such restoration will have been granted duly, and others to whom it will have been unduly granted.</p>  
 <p>'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, to whom, &amp;c., restoration has been granted unduly? A eunuch, O Bhikkhus, to whom restoration had not been granted before, and whom the Sa<i>m</i>gha restores, has been restored unduly. A person who has furtively attached himself (to the Sa<i>m</i>gha), &amp;c. <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">1</font></a>, to whom restoration had not been granted before, and whom the Sa<i>m</i>gha restores, has been restored unduly.</p>  
 <p>'This, O Bhikkhus, is called a person to whom, &amp;c., restoration has been granted unduly. These, O Bhikkhus, are called persons to whom, &amp;c., restoration has been granted duly.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_508"></a><a href="sbe17102.htm#fr_517">271:3</a> This list of persons who cannot protest against official acts of the Sa<i>m</i>gha differs from that given in § 2 or at II, 36, §§ 1-4, only by three categories being here added after 'a person guilty of an extreme offence' (antimavatthu<i>m</i> a<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âpannaka). These categories are the following: 'a madman,' 'a person whose mind is unhinged,' 'a person who suffers (bodily) pain.' See II, 22, 3, &amp;c,</p>
 <p><a name="fn_509"></a><a href="sbe17102.htm#fr_518">271:4</a> That is, the Sa<i>m</i>gha which is going to perform the act in question.</p>
