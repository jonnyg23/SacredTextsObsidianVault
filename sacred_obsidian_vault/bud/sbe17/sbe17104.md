 <p>1. And the venerable Upâli <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">1</font></a> went to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable Upâli said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, if a complete congregation performs an act at which the presence (of the accused Bhikkhu) is required, in his absence--is this act, Lord, performed lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya?'</p>  
 <p>'It is performed, Upâli, unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'Lord, if a complete congregation performs an act at which (the accused Bhikkhu) ought to be called upon for an answer, without calling upon him for an answer--if it performs an act at which the confession (of the culprit) is required, without his confession--if it grants to a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">2</font></a> ought to be granted, an amû<i>lh</i>avinaya <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">3</font></a>--if it proceeds against a Bhikkhu to whom amû<i>lh</i>avinaya ought to be granted, with the tassapâpiyyasikâkamma <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">4</font></a>--if it proceeds against a Bhikkhu against whom the tassapâpiyyasikâkamma ought</p>

 <p>3. 'It is performed, Upâli, unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya. If a complete congregation, Upâli, performs an act at which the presence (of the accused Bhikkhu) is required, in his absence (&amp;c., down to:) confers on a Bhikkhu to whom abbhâna ought to be granted, the upasampadâ ordination,--in such case, Upâli, this act is performed unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya, and in such case this Sa<i>m</i>gha trespasses against the law.'</p>

 <p>It is performed, Upâli, lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya.

 <p>5. 'Lord, if a complete congregation grants to a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya ought to be granted, an amû<i>lh</i>avinaya, and to a Bhikkhu to whom amû<i>lh</i>avinaya ought to be granted, a sativinaya (&amp;c. <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">1</font></a>, down to:) confers on a Bhikkhu to whom abbhâna. ought to be granted, the upasampadâ ordination, and grants to a person on whom the upasampadâ ordination ought to be conferred, the decree of abbhâna,--is this act, Lord, performed lawfully according to Dhamma and Vinaya?'</p>

 <p>9. And the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'If a complete congregation, O Bhikkhus, grants to a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya ought to be granted, an amû<i>lh</i>avinaya, in such case, O Bhikkhus, this act is performed unlawfully against Dhamma and Vinaya, and in such case this Sa<i>m</i>gha trespasses against the law. If a complete congregation, O Bhikkhus, institutes against a Bhikkhu to whom sativinaya ought to be granted, the tassapâpiyyasikâkamma (&amp;c. <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">2</font></a>, down to:) grants to a person on whom the</p>

 <p><a name="fn_520"></a><a href="sbe17104.htm#fr_529">276:1</a> That the redactors of this Pi<i>t</i>aka have chosen Upâli here and at X, 6, <i>K</i>ullavagga II, 2, 7, to question the Blessed One about the Vinaya regulations, stands evidently in connection with the tradition ascribing to Upâli an especial authority regarding the rules of the Order and styling him, as is said in the Dîpava<i>m</i>sa (IV, 3, 5; V, 7,. 9), agganikkhittaka, i.e. original depositary, of the Vinaya tradition. See our Introduction, p. xii seq.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_524"></a><a href="sbe17104.htm#fr_533">277:1</a> This Sa<i>m</i>ghakamma and the following ones are explained in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_525"></a><a href="sbe17104.htm#fr_534">277:2</a> For this term and the next ones, see <i>K</i>ullavagga III, 1-9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_526"></a><a href="sbe17104.htm#fr_535">278:1</a> The Sa<i>m</i>ghakammas enumerated in § 2, beginning with sativinaya, are arranged here in pairs, in direct and reverse order, in this way: sativinaya and amû<i>lh</i>avinaya, amû<i>lh</i>avinaya and sativinaya; then amû<i>lh</i>avinaya and tassapâpiyyasikâkamma, tassapâpiyyasikâkamma and amû<i>lh</i>avinaya, &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_528"></a><a href="sbe17104.htm#fr_537">279:2</a> In this paragraph all possible combinations of two different Sa<i>m</i>ghakammas are formed in this way: first, sativinaya is combined with amû<i>lh</i>avinaya and all the rest, down to upasampadâ; then amû<i>lh</i>avinaya with all terms from tassapâpiyyasikâ down to sativinaya, and so on; the whole series ends thus with the combinations of upasampadâraha with all terms from sativinaya down to abbhâna.</p>
