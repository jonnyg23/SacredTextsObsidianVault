 <p>And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Râ<i>g</i>agaha. There the Blessed One dwelt near Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, at Kalandakanivâpa. At that time the Bhikkhus at Râ<i>g</i>agaha had plenty of sugar. The Bhikkhus feared to offend (and thought): 'The Blessed One has allowed the eating of sugar only to the sick and not to the healthy,' and therefore they did not eat sugar.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to the sick the eating of sugar, and to the healthy the drinking of sugar-water.'</p>
