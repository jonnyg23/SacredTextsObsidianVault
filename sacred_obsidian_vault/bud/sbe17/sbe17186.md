 <p>1. 'And in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is guilty of a number of Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, definite, and not concealed--not definite, and not concealed--of one designation, and not concealed--of various designations, and not concealed--similar, and not concealed--dissimilar, and not concealed--connected <a name="fr_763"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and not concealed--disconnected, and not concealed--and then throws off the robes <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' . . .</p>

 <p><a name="fn_741"></a><a href="sbe17186.htm#fr_763">431:1</a> On the opposition of vavatthita and sambhinna, compare Minayeff Pâtimokkha, p. 29, where these two expressions are used of language.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_742"></a><a href="sbe17186.htm#fr_764">431:2</a> The chapter is translated as it stands. To supply the implications involved, the words 'a Bhikkhu' at the beginning should be understood as 'a Bhikkhu undergoing probation, or liable to the Mânatta discipline, or undergoing the Mânatta discipline, or fit to be rehabilitated.' And the conclusion should be supplied as in chap. 28, except that the penalty in each case is not an additional probation, but a probation corresponding in length to the period which has elapsed since the first of those offences which the re-ordained Bhikkhu has concealed (either before or after the second ordination). The details are only worked out, in chap. 28, of the first of the several pairs here enumerated, and are intended to be supplied here for each of the other pairs in a similar way. All the pairs recur in chaps. 35, 36.</p>
