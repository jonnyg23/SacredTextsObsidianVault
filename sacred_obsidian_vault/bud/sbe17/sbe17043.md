 <p>1. And the Blessed One went to Ko<i>t</i>igâma. There at Ko<i>t</i>igâma the Blessed One resided. And the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'It is through not understanding and grasping four Noble Truths, O Bhikkhus, that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of transmigration, both you and I. And what are</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>these four? By not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth of Suffering, O Bhikkhus; by not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth of the Cause of suffering; by not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth of the Cessation of suffering; by not understanding and grasping the Noble Truth of the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering: thereby we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of trans-migration, both you and I.</p>  
 <p>2. 'But now, O Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of Suffering is understood and grasped;' the Noble Truth of the Cause of suffering, &amp;c., of the Cessation of suffering, &amp;c., of the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering is understood and grasped. The craving for existence is rooted out; that which leads to renewed existence is destroyed; and there is no more birth!</p>  
 <p>'By not seeing the four Noble Truths as they really are, long is the path that is traversed through many a birth.</p>  
 <p>'Now these are grasped; the cause of birth is removed, the root of sorrow rooted out, and there is no more birth.'</p>
