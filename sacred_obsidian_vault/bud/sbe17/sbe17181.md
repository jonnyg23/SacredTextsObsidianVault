The Samanta Pâsâdikâ merely says, Antarâ sambahulâ âpattiyo âpa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati parimâ<i>n</i>â pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annâyo ti âdisu âpatti-pari<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edavase parimâ<i>n</i>âyo <i>k</i>’ eva appa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annâyo <i>k</i>â ’ti attho. The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the word is acc. fem. plur., and not an adverb. Compare chap. 33, below.</p>
