 <p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu kept Vassa <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">2</font></a> alone. The people then gave him robes, saying, 'We give them to the Sa<i>m</i>gha.'</p>  
 <p>Then that Bhikkhu thought: 'It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the lowest number which can constitute a Sa<i>m</i>gha is four <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Now I am by myself, and these people have given the robes, saying, "We give them to the Sa<i>m</i>gha." I had better take these robes, which are the property of a Sa<i>m</i>gha, to Sâvatthi.'</p>  
 <p>So that Bhikkhu did so, and told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'These robes are your own, O Bhikkhu, until the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony shall have been performed <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu keep Vassa alone, and the people of the place give</p>

 <p>him robes, intending them for the Sa<i>m</i>gha,--I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that those robes shall be his until the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony shall have been performed.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu spent the rest of the year (besides the rainy season) <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">1</font></a> alone. The people there (&amp;c., as before, in the first paragraph of 24. 1, down to the end).</p>  
 <p>So that Bhikkhu did so, and told the matter to the Bhikkhus. They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are to divide such robes with the Sa<i>m</i>gha (whether large or small in number) that may be present there.</p>  
 <p>4. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu spend the rest of the year (besides the rainy season) alone, if and the people of the place give him robes, intending them for the Sa<i>m</i>gha,--I allow, O Bhikkhus, that that Bhikkhu should appropriate those robes to himself <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">2</font></a>, saying, "These robes are for me." If another Bhikkhu should arrive before those robes have been appropriated to that Bhikkhu, an equal share is to be given (to the in-coming Bhikkhu). If while the robes are being divided by those Bhikkhus, and before the lot has been cast, another Bhikkhu should arrive, an equal share is to be given to him. If while the robes are being divided by those Bhikkhus, and after the lot has been cast, another Bhikkhu</p>

 <p>should arrive, an equal share need not, if they do not wish it <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">1</font></a>, be given to him.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time two Theras, who were brothers, the venerable Isidâsa and the venerable Isibhatta, having spent the rainy season in Sâvatthi, went to take up their abode in a certain village. The people there, thinking, 'It is long since these Theras have arrived here,' made gifts of both food and robes.</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus who resided there asked the Theras, saying, 'These robes, Sirs, which are the property of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, have come to us through the Theras' arrival <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Will the Theras accept a share?'</p>  
 <p>The Theras answered: 'As we understand the rule laid down by the Blessed One, these robes belong to you alone until the K a Mina ceremony shall have been performed <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now at that time three Bhikkhus spent the rainy season at Râ<i>g</i>agaha. The people there made gifts of robes, saying, 'We give them to the Sa<i>m</i>gha.'</p>  
 <p>Then those Bhikkhus thought thus: 'It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the smallest Sa<i>m</i>gha shall consist of four persons, and we are only three, and these people have made gifts of robes, intending to give them to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. What now ought we to do with them?'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time there were staying in Pâ<i>t</i>aliputta,</p>

 <p>at the kukku<i>t</i>ârâma, a number of Theras--the venerable Nilavâsi, and the venerable Sâ<i>n</i>avâsi <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="sbe17092.htm#fn_451"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the venerable Gopaka, and the venerable Bhagu, and the venerable Phalika-sandâna. And those Bhikkhus went to Pâ<i>t</i>aliputta, and asked the Theras what they should do.</p>  
 <p>The Theras answered: 'As we understand the rule laid down by the Blessed One, these robes belong to you alone until the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony shall have been performed.'</p>
