 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhus used to get up on to couches or chairs with unwashen feet; and the robes and seats became soiled.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings when one of you wishes to get up on to couches or chairs.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time when the Bhikkhus were going to the Uposatha Hall or to the assembly in the dark, they trod upon stakes or thorns, and their feet were hurt.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings in the open Ârâma, and of a torch, or lamp, and a walking stick <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to rise up in the night towards dawn; and, putting on wooden shoes, walked up and down in the open air talking, in tones high, loud, and harsh, of all kinds of worldly things--such as tales of kings, of robbers, of ministers of state; tales of armies, of terror, of war; conversation respecting meats, drinks, clothes, couches, garlands, perfumes, relationships, equipages, villages, towns, cities, provinces, women, warriors, and streets; tales about buried treasures, ghost stories; various tales; discussions</p>

 <p>on the world; disasters by sea; things which are, and things which are not <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And so doing they both trod upon and slew all kinds of insects, and disturbed the Bhikkhus in their meditations.</p>  
 <p>4. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus [do so]?'</p>  
 <p>And those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true' (&amp;c., comp. chap. 4. 2)?</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: Wooden shoes, O Bhikkhus, are not to be worn. Whosoever wears them, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>
