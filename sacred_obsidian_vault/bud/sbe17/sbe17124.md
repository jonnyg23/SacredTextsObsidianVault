 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu were dwelling on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill, wicked Bhikkhus, and shameless. Such as these were the evil practices they followed: they used to plant cuttings of flowers, and have them planted; they used to water flowers, and have them watered; they used to gather them, and have them gathered; they used to make them up into nosegays, and have them so made up; they used to make them up, and to have them made up, into wreaths, of the kind with the stalks together, and of the kind with the stalks separate <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">2</font></a>, of the kind called ma<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>arikâ <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">3</font></a>, of the kind called vidhutikâ <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">4</font></a>, of the kind called va<i>t</i>a<i>m</i><i>s</i>aka <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">5</font></a>, of the kind</p>

 <p>called âve<i>l</i>a <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of the kind called ura<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ada <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--and they then used to take or send wreaths of each of these various kinds to the wives and daughters and young women and sisters-in-law and female slaves in respectable families;--and they used to eat out of one dish, to drink out of one vessel, to sit on one seat, to lie on one bed, one mat, one coverlet, with the wives and daughters and young women and sisters-in-law and female slaves in respectable families;--and they used to eat food at the wrong time, and to drink strong drink, and to make use of garlands, and scents, and unguents;--and they used to dance, and sing, and play music, and wanton, and all these together in every combination.</p>  
 <p>2. And they used to amuse themselves at games <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">3</font></a> with eight pieces and ten pieces, and with tossing up, hopping over diagrams formed on the ground, and removing substances from a heap without shaking the remainder; and with games at dice, and trap-ball; and with sketching rude figures, tossing balls, blowing trumpets, having matches at ploughing with mimic ploughs, tumbling, forming mimic wind-mills, guessing at measures, having</p>

 <p>chariot races, and archery matches, shooting marbles with the fingers, guessing other people's thoughts, and mimicking other people's acts;--and they used to practise elephant riding, and horse riding, and carriage driving, and archery, and swordsmanship;--and they used to run to and fro in front of elephants, and in front of horses, and in front of carriages and they used to exhibit signs of anger <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and to wring their hands <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and to wrestle <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and to box with their fists;--and spreading their robes out as a stage they used to invite dancing girls, saying, 'Here you may dance, sister!' and greet her with applause <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Thus manifold were the evil lives which they practised.</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu who had spent the rainy season in the country of Kâsi, and was on his way to visit the Blessed One, arrived at the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill. And that Bhikkhu in the early morning put on his under garment, and went, duly bowled and robed, to the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill for alms. And he was perfect in dignity, with his eyes cast down, and pleasing in appearance, whether in going in or</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a></p>  
 <p>in coming out, in looking or in watching, in bending in his arm or in stretching it forth <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Then the people on beholding that Bhikkhu, said, 'Who is this fellow like a fool of fools, or like an idiot of idiots, or like a simpleton of simpletons <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">2</font></a>? Who would give an alms when this fellow comes near! Now our own masters, the followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, are gentle, friendly, pleasant in speech, radiant with smiles, by no means fools, but open in countenance, and the first to speak. To such now it is fit to give an alms!'</p>  
 <p>And a certain lay-disciple saw that Bhikkhu as he was going along the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill for alms. And on seeing him, he went up to the place where he was; and on coming there he said to that Bhikkhu:</p>  
 <p>'Has your reverence received an alms?'</p>  
 <p>'No, my friend, I have received no alms!'</p>  
 <p>'Come, your reverence! Let us go to my house!' 4. So the lay-disciple took the Bhikkhu to his house, and gave him to eat, and asked him: 'Whither then is your reverence going?'</p>  
 <p>'I am on my way to Sâvatthi, my friend, to visit the Blessed One.'</p>  
 <p>'Then let your reverence bow down at the feet of the Blessed One in my name, and say, "The residence on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill, Lord, has been spoiled. The Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are dwelling on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill, wicked Bhikkhus, and shameless. Such as these are the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a></p>  
 <p>evil practices they follow (&amp;c., as in §§ 1, 2, down to the end). And people, Lord, who were formerly believers and full of faith, are now become non-believers and void of faith; the opportunities of alms that were formerly open to the Sa<i>m</i>gha are now destroyed; worthy Bhikkhus forsake, and wicked Bhikkhus dwell in the place. Let, Lord, the Blessed One be pleased to send (other) Bhikkhus to the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill in order that the residence there may be re-established."'</p>  
 <p>5. 'Very well, my friend,' said the Bhikkhu, in assent, to that lay-disciple. And rising from his seat, he set out for Sâvatthi, and went straight on to Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's grove, to the <i>G</i>etavana in Sâvatthi, to the place where the Blessed One was staying. And on arriving there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side.</p>  
 <p>Now it is the custom for the Blessed Buddhas to exchange words of greeting with in-coming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to that Bhikkhu, 'Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhu? Have you enough for your support? Have you accomplished your journey without too much fatigue? And whence, O Bhikkhu, have you come?'</p>  
 <p>'Things go well with me, Lord. I have enough for my support. And I have accomplished my journey without too much fatigue. I have spent the rainy season, Lord, in the land of Kâsi; and on my way to Sâvatthi to visit the Blessed One I arrived at the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill. And after having dressed early in the morning, I went, Lord, duly bowled and robed, on to the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill for alms. And a certain lay-disciple saw me (&amp;c., as above, down to the end of § 4, with the alterations necessary to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a></p>  
 <p>the narrative form of speech). Thence, Lord, am I come.'</p>  
 <p>6. Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-Sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, and are dwelling on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill, are wicked Bhikkhus, and shameless; and that such are the evil practices they follow (&amp;c., as in § 4, down to the end)?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can they, O Bhikkhus, foolish persons that they are, follow such practices as these (&amp;c., as in §§ 1, 2, down to the end)? This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, to the conversion of the unconverted (&amp;c., as usual. Compare chap. 1, § 2, down to the end).'</p>  
 <p>And when the Blessed Buddha had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the venerable Sâriputta and Moggallâna, and said, 'Go now, Sâriputta and Moggallâna <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">1</font></a>, to the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill. And on arriving there carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma (Act of Banishment <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">2</font></a>) against those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, to the effect that they may become your Saddhi-vihârikas <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a></p>  
 <p>'How, Lord, can we carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma against those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu; for they are passionate men and violent?'</p>  
 <p>'Then do you go, Sâriputta and Moggallâna, together with a number of Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>'So be it, Lord!' said Sâriputta and Moggallâna, in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place the Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu ought to be warned: when they have been warned, they ought to be reminded (of the Rule in the Pâtimokkha against which they have offended); when they have been reminded they ought to be charged with the offence; when they have been charged some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>  
 <p>"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are wicked Bhikkhus and shameless. Their evil practices are both seen and heard, and also that respectable families have been led astray by them is seen, too, and heard <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">2</font></a>. If the time is fit for the Sa<i>m</i>gha to do so, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma against those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, to the effect that the Bhikkhus who are followers</p>

 <p><a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are not to dwell on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill'.</p>  
 <p>'"This is the motion (ñatti).</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are wicked Bhikkhus and shameless. Their evil practices (&amp;c., as before, down to) is seen, too, and heard. The Sa<i>m</i>gha hereby carries out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma against them, to the effect that the Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are not to dwell on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the carrying out of the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma against the followers (&amp;c., as before) to the effect (&amp;c., as before <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">1</font></a>) let him remain silent. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.</p>  
 <p>'"A second time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha (&amp;c., as before). A third time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha (&amp;c., as before).</p>  
 <p>'"The Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma has been carried out by the Sa<i>m</i>gha against those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu to the effect that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are not to dwell on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill'. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves of it. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>
