 <p>1. Now after the Blessed One had remained at Sâvatthi as long as he thought fit, he. went forth on his journey towards Râ<i>g</i>agaha. And on the way the venerable Kaṅkhâ-revata saw a sugar factory, and on stepping aside to it (he saw the men) putting flour and cane-dust into the molasses. When he saw that he thought: 'Molasses mixed with food is not permitted: it is not permitted to take such molasses (at a time) beyond the time (for the daily meal).' And fearing to offend he ate not of it, and his attendant Bhikkhus ate not, and such as held him worthy to be heard, they ate not.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Why, O Bhikkhus, do they put flour and cane-dust into molasses?'</p>  
 <p>'In order, Lord, to make it firm.'</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, they put flour and cane-dust into molasses to make it firm, but it is still (nevertheless) considered to be molasses, I allow you, O Bhikkhus, such molasses as much as you like.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now the venerable Kaṅkhâ-revata saw on the way a kidney bean growing out of a dung heap. And when he had seen it, he thought: 'Beans are not permitted (to us, for) beans grow ready ripe <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">2</font></a>: And</p>

 <p>he did not eat, fearing to offend, and his attendant Bhikkhus did not eat, and such as held him worthy to be heard, they also did not eat the beans.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Though, Bhikkhus, beans grow ready ripe, yet I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to eat beans as much as you like.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu suffered from wind in the stomach. He drank salt sour gruel; and thereby his sickness abated.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>I allow, O Bhikkhus, to one who is sick the use of salt sour gruel, to one who is not sick the use thereof mixed with water <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">1</font></a> as a beverage.'</p>

Perhaps the doubt was supposed to have arisen because the beans required no cooking, but grew, ready to eat, of themselves.</p>
