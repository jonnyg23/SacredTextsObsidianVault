 <p>1. Now the Blessed One proceeded straight on, on his alms-pilgrimage, to Âpa<i>n</i>a. And Keniya the ascetic <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">2</font></a> heard the saying, 'Behold! the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, who was born in the Sâkya clan, and who went forth from the Sâkya clan (to adopt the religious life), has arrived at Âpa<i>n</i>a, and is staying at Âpa<i>n</i>a. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad that he is said to be a fully-enlightened one, blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed, who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha. He by himself thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were face to face, this universe, the world with its Devas, and with its Brahmas, and with its Mâras, and all creatures, Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, gods and men: and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he make known, both in the spirit and in the letter:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p>lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation. The higher life doth he proclaim, in all its purity and all its perfectness. Blessed is the sight of Arahats like that <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'What now should I have taken <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">2</font></a> to the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama.'</p>  
 <p>2. And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'They who are the ancient <i>Ri</i>shis of the Brâhmans, the authors of the sacred verses, the utterers of the sacred verses, whose ancient form of words, so uttered chaunted or composed, the Brâhmans of to-day chaunt over again and repeat, intoning or reciting exactly as had been intoned or recited--to wit, A<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka, Vâmaka, Vâmadeva, Vessâmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, Vâse<i>t</i><i>th</i>a, and Bhagu <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">3</font></a>--they were abstainers from food at night, and abstainers from food at the wrong time, yet they used to receive such things as drinks. (3.) Now the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is also an abstainer from food</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p>at night, an abstainer from food at the wrong time <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">1</font></a>. It will be worthy of him too to receive such things as drinks. And when he had had a quantity of drinkables made ready he had them carried on pingoes and went up to the place where the Blessed One was. And when he had come there, he greeted him; and after exchanging with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he stood by on one side. And so standing Keniya the ascetic spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>  
 <p>'May the Blessed One accept at my hands these drinkables.'</p>  
 <p>'Very good then, Keniya; give them to the Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not receive them.</p>  
 <p>'Receive them, O Bhikkhus, and make use of them.'</p>  
 <p>4. Then Keniya the ascetic having, with his own hand, satisfied the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head with many drinkables until they refused any more, took his seat, when the Blessed One had washed his hands, and had laid aside the bowl, on one side. And when he was so seated the Blessed One taught and incited and aroused and gladdened Keniya the ascetic with religious discourse: and Keniya the ascetic, when he had been taught and incited and aroused and gladdened by the Blessed One with religious discourse, spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>  
 <p>'May the venerable Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the to-morrow's meal for him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. 'Great, O Keniya, is the company of the Bhikkhus. Two hundred and fifty are the Bhikkhus in number. And thou art greatly devoted to the Brâhmans.'</p>  
 <p>Yet a second time spake Keniya the ascetic to the Blessed One thus:</p>  
 <p>'What though the company of the Bhikkhus, O Gotama, be great; and though two hundred and fifty be the number of the Bhikkhus. May the venerable Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the to-morrow's meal for him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>'Great, O Keniya (&amp;c., as before).'</p>  
 <p>Yet a third time spake Keniya the ascetic to the venerable Gotama thus:</p>  
 <p>'What though the company of the Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before).'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One granted, by remaining silent, his consent. And when Keniya the ascetic perceived that the Blessed One had granted his consent, he arose from his seat, and departed thence.</p>  
 <p>6. Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, after he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, eight kinds of drink-able things: mango-syrup, and jambu-syrup, and plantain-syrup <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and mo<i>k</i>a-syrup, and honey, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p>  
 <p>grape juice, and syrup made from the edible root of the water-lily <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and phârusaka <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">2</font></a>-syrup. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the juice of all fruits, except the juice prepared from corn <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">3</font></a>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks prepared from all leaves, except drinks prepared from potherbs <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">4</font></a>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks prepared from all flowers, except liquorice-juice <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">5</font></a>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of the juice of the sugar cane.'</p>  
 <p>7. And Keniya the ascetic, at the end of the night, had sweet food, both hard and soft, made ready at his hermitage: and he had the time announced to the Blessed One, saying, 'It is time, O Gotama, and the meal is ready.'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One, having put on his under robes early in the morning, went, duly bowled and . robed, to the place where the hermitage of Keniya the ascetic was. And when he had arrived there, he sat down on the seat spread out for him, and with him the company of the Bhikkhus. Then</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Keniya the ascetic, with his own hand, offered to the company of the Bhikkhus with the Buddha at their head, and satisfied them with the sweet food, both hard and soft. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had washed his hands and his bowl, he (Keniya) took his seat on one side.</p>  
 <p>8. And when he was so seated the Blessed One pronounced the benediction on Keniya the ascetic in these verses:</p>  
 <p>'Of the offerings <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">1</font></a> the fire sacrifice is the chief, of sacred verses the chief is the Sâvitthi <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">2</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>'Among men the king is chief; and of waters the ocean,</p>  
 <p>'Of constellations the moon is chief, and of heat-givers the sun,</p>  
 <p>But of them, the conquering ones, who long after good, the Sa<i>m</i>gha, verily, is chief.'</p>  
 <p>And when the Blessed One had, in these verses, pronounced the benediction <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">3</font></a> on Keniya the ascetic, he rose from his seat, and departed thence <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_231"></a><a href="sbe17049.htm#fr_235">130:2</a> That is, as a present, the usual tribute of respect.</p>

See Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 172, &amp;c. Most of these names are easily to be identified, being in Sanskrit Vâmadeva, Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, <i>G</i>amadagni (who is only mentioned in this list in reference to Rig-veda III, 62, quoted from below. See also Oldenberg's note to <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana's G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra IV, 10 in Indische Studien XV, 153), Âṅgirasa, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, Vasish<i>th</i>a, Ka<i>s</i>yapa, and Bh<i>ri</i>gu. The only doubtful names are Vâmaka and A<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka. The latter must be Ash<i>t</i>aka, mentioned as the author of Rig-veda X, 104, unless it be supposed to be a corrupt reading under which some representation of Atri may lurk. Vâmaka is the only unintelligible form, for it would be difficult to see how that word could come to stand for the Vamra to whom Rig-veda X, 99 is ascribed.</p>

Buddhaghosa's words are Ko<i>k</i>a-pânan ti a<i>t</i><i>th</i>ika-kadali-phalehi kata-pâna<i>m</i>; and he explains mo<i>k</i>a by ana<i>t</i><i>th</i>ikehi kadali-phalehi kata-pâ<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>. As kadali is the ordinary plantain or banana, which has no seeds, the meaning of the difference he makes between the two kinds is not clear. The expression eka<i>t</i><i>th</i>ithâlapakka, at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 70, evidently rests on the same meaning of the word atthi, which there also <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a> cannot be, as usual, seed; for there is no such thing as a palmyra fruit with one seed. See Rh. D.'s note on p. 94 of the 'Buddhist Birth Stories.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="sbe17049.htm#fr_241">133:3</a> Toddy and arrack are so prepared. The use of toddy was one of the famous Ten Points of the heretics at the Council of Vesâlî. See below, <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 11. Buddhaghosa explains this as 'drink made from any one of the seven kinds of corn;' where the seven kinds referred to must be those mentioned in the Abhidhâna-ppadîpikâ, verses 450, 451.</p>
