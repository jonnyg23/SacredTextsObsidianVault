The technical term kamma<i>m</i> kopeti is not to revoke the valid decision of a kamma regularly held, but to show that the kamma by reason of some irregularity was no real kamma, and its whole proceedings therefore void. One may compare akuppâ me <i>k</i>eto-vimutti spoken by the Buddha immediately after he had attained Nirvâ<i>n</i>a under the Bo Tree (Ariyapariyosâna Sutta in H. O.'s 'Buddha,' p. 429) and the opposite idea in Sutta Nipâta IV, 3, 5.</p>
