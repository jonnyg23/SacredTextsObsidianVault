 <p>1. So the Sa<i>m</i>gha carried out against Ari<i>t</i><i>th</i>a the Bhikkhu, who had formerly been a vulture tormentor, the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not renouncing a sinful doctrine, to the intent that he should not eat nor dwell with the Sa<i>m</i>gha. And when he had been thus subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not renouncing a sinful doctrine, he left the Order.</p>  
 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can Ari<i>t</i><i>th</i>a the Bhikkhu, having been subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not</p>

 <p>renouncing a sinful doctrine, leave the Order?' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus, 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that Ari<i>t</i><i>th</i>a the Bhikkhu, having been subjected (&amp;c., as before, down to) left the Order?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'How can Ari<i>t</i><i>th</i>a the Bhikkhu (&amp;c., as before, down to) leave the Order? This will not conduce either to the conversion of the unconverted, nor to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted not being converted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
 <p>And when he had rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse, the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let then the Sa<i>m</i>gha, O Bhikkhus, revoke the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not renouncing a sinful doctrine, which has been carried out against Ari<i>t</i><i>th</i>a the Bhikkhu.</p>  
 <p>'There are five things, O Bhikkhus, [&amp;c., as before, in chapters 6 and 7, down to the end.]'</p>
