 <p>the law, and according to law respectively, in the precise wording of chapters 2 and 3, reading Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya for Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya. Then follow the six cases of permissive suspension in the precise wording of chapter 4, but in addition to the cases there given for the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-kamma, §§ 1 and 2 of this chapter are respectively added at the end of §§ 1 and 2 of that chapter.]</p>  
 <p>1. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise a Bhikkhu, the Sa<i>m</i>gha, if it likes, should carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma against him; (that is to say), when he is characterised by frivolity <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">1</font></a> of action--when he is characterised by frivolity of speech--when he is characterised by frivolity both of action and of speech. These are the three things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) against him.</p>  
 <p>'There are other three things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise a Bhikkhu, the Sa<i>m</i>gha, if it likes, should carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma against him; (that is to say), when he is characterised by absence of right-doing in action--when he is characterised by absence of right-doing in speech--when he is characterised by absence of right-doing both in action and in speech. These are the other three things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) against him.</p>  
 <p>'There are other three things (&amp;c., as in each of the last paragraphs; the three things here being injury <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">2</font></a> done by him to others in action, in speech, and both in action and in speech, owing to his own</p>

 <p>want of training in the precepts and practices of the order).</p>  
 <p>'There are other three things (&amp;c., as in each of the last paragraphs, the three things here being evilness of life in action, in speech, and both in action and in speech).</p>  
 <p>2. 'There are three kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, against whom, when the Sa<i>m</i>gha likes (to do so), it should carry out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma; (that is to say), one who is frivolous in action--one who is frivolous in speech--one who is frivolous both in action and in speech. These are the three kinds of Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as above, down to) the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma.</p>  
 <p>There are other three kinds of Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, substituting first, absence of right-doing--secondly, injury to others--and thirdly, evilness of life respectively in action, in speech, and both in action and in speech).'</p>
