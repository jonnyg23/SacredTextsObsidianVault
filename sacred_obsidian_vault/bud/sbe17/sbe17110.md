 <p>1. And the Blessed One, having dwelt at Pârileyyaka as long as he thought fit, went forth to Sâvatthi. Wandering from place to place he came to Sâvatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at Sâvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, the garden of Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika. And the lay-devotees of Kosambî thought: 'These venerable Bhikkhus of Kosambî have brought much misfortune to us; worried <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">1</font></a> by them the Blessed One is gone. Well, let us neither salute the venerable Bhikkhus of Kosambî, nor rise from our seats before them, nor raise our hands before them, nor perform the proper duties towards them, nor honour and esteem and revere and sup-port them, nor give them food when they come on their walks for alms; thus, when they are not honoured, esteemed, revered, supported, and hospitably received by us, they will go away, or return to the world, or propitiate the Blessed One.'</p>  
 <p>2. Thus the lay-devotees of Kosambî did not salute any more the Bhikkhus of Kosambî, nor did they rise from their seats before. them (&amp;c., down to:) nor gave them food when they came on their walks for alms.</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus of Kosambî, when they were no more honoured (&amp;c., down to:) and hospitably</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>received by the lay-devotees of Kosambî, said to each other: 'Well, friends, let us go to Sâvatthi and let us settle there that question before the Blessed One.' And the Bhikkhus of Kosambî put their resting-places in order, took up their alms-bowls and their robes, and went forth to Sâvatthi.</p>  
 <p>3. And the venerable Sâriputta heard: Those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosambî, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, are coming to Sâvatthi.' And the venerable Sâriputta went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable Sâriputta said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious (&amp;c., down to:) are coming to Sâvatthi. How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, Sâriputta, you must side with those who are right according to the Dhamma.'</p>  
 <p>'But how shall I discern, Lord, what is right and what is wrong?'</p>  
 <p>4. 'There are eighteen things, Sâriputta, by which you may conclude that a Bhikkhu is wrong according to the Dhamma. In case, Sâriputta, a Bhikkhu declares what is not Dhamma to be Dhamma, or declares what is Dhamma not to be Dhamma, or declares what is not Vinaya to be Vinaya, or declares what is Vinaya not to be Vinaya, or declares what has not been taught and spoken by the Tathâgata to have been taught and spoken by the Tathâgata, or declares something taught and spoken by the Tathâgata not to have been taught and spoken by the Tathâgata, or declares what has not been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>practised by the Tathâgata to have been practised by the Tathâgata, or declares something practised by the Tathâgata not to have been practised by the Tathâgata, or declares what has not been ordained by the Tathâgata to have been ordained by the Tathâgata, or declares something ordained by the Tathâgata not to have been ordained by the Tathâgata, or declares what is no offence to be an offence, or declares an offence to be no offence, or declares a slight offence to be a grievous offence, or declares a grievous offence to be a slight offence, or declares (a rule regarding) an offence to which there is an exception to be without an exception, or declares (a rule regarding) an offence to which there is no exception to admit of exceptions <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or declares a grave offence  <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">2</font></a> to be a not grave offence, or declares an offence that is not grave to be a grave offence,--these are the eighteen things, Sâriputta, by which you may conclude that a Bhikkhu is wrong according to the Dhamma.</p>  
 <p>5. 'And there are eighteen things, Sâriputta, by which you may conclude that a Bhikkhu is right according to the Dhamma. In case, Sâriputta, a Bhikkhu declares what is not Dhamma to be not</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Dhamma, or declares what is Dhamma to be Dhamma (&amp;c., down to:), or declares a grave offence to be a grave offence, or declares an offence that is not grave to be not grave,--these are the eighteen things, Sâriputta, by which you may conclude that a Bhikkhu is right according to the Dhamma.'</p>  
 <p>6. And the venerable Mahâmoggallâna heard (&amp;c., as in § 3--5)--and the venerable Mahâkassapa heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mahâka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âna heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mahâko<i>t</i><i>th</i>ita <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">1</font></a> heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mahâkappina heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Mahâ<i>k</i>unda heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Anuruddha heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Revata heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Upâli heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Ânanda heard, &amp;c.--and the venerable Râhula heard (&amp;c., as above).</p>  
 <p>7. And Mahâpa<i>g</i>âpati Gotamî heard: 'Those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosambî, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, are coming to Sâvatthi.' And Mahâpa<i>g</i>âpati Gotamî went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, she stationed herself near him. Standing near him Mahâpa<i>g</i>âpati Gotamî said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious (&amp;c., down to:) are coming to Sâvatthi. How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, Gotamî, hear the Dhamma on both sides. When you have heard the Dhamma on both sides,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p>then accept the opinion and the belief and the doctrine and the cause of those Bhikkhus who are right according to the Dhamma; and whatever the Bhikkhunîsa<i>m</i>gha has to apply for to the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for all that you must apply to the party of those who are right.'</p>  
 <p>8. And Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder heard (&amp;c., as in 3, down to:). 'How am I to behave, Lord, towards those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, householder, bestow gifts on both sides; having bestowed gifts on both sides, hear the Dhamma on both sides. When you have heard the Dhamma on both sides, then accept the opinion and the belief and the doctrine and the cause of those Bhikkhus who are right according to the Dhamma.'</p>  
 <p>9. And Visâkhâ Migâramâtâ heard, &amp;c. <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. And the Bhikkhus of Kosambî in due course came to Sâvatthi. And the venerable Sâriputta went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him the venerable Sâriputta said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those litigious, contentious, quarrelsome, disputatious Bhikkhus of Kosambî, the constant raisers of questions before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, have arrived at Sâvatthi. How are we, Lord, to arrange the dwelling-places of those Bhikkhus?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, Sâriputta, assign separate dwelling-places to them.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And if there be no separate dwelling-places, what are we to do then, Lord?'</p>  
 <p>'Then, Sâriputta, you must separate (some dwelling-places from the rest) and then assign them (to those Bhikkhus). But in no wise, Sâriputta, do I say that the dwelling-place of a senior Bhikkhu must be taken from him. He who does that, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>  
 <p>'And how are we to act, Lord, regarding (the distribution of) material gifts <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'Material gifts, Sâriputta, must be distributed among all in equal parts.'</p>  
 <p>11. And that Bhikkhu against whom expulsion had been pronounced, pondering over both Dhamma and Vinaya, came to the following conclusion: 'This is an offence; this is not no offence. I am an offender; I am not offenceless. I am expelled; I am not un-expelled. The sentence by which I have been expelled is lawful, unobjectionable, and valid.' Then that expelled Bhikkhu went to the expelled Bhikkhu's partisans; having approached them, he said to the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu: 'This is an offence, friends; this is not no offence, &amp;c. Come now, my venerable brethren, and restore me.'</p>  
 <p>12. Then the partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu took with them the expelled Bhikkhu, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat down near him. Sitting near him those Bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, this Bhikkhu, against whom expulsion has been pronounced, says, "This is an offence, friends (&amp;c.,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p>down to:) and restore me." What are we to do here, Lord?'</p>  
 <p>This is an offence, O Bhikkhus; this is not no offence. This Bhikkhu is an offender; this Bhikkhu is not offenceless. This Bhikkhu is expelled; he is not unexpelled; the sentence by which he has been expelled is lawful, unobjectionable, and valid. But since this Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, sees (his offence), restore now that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>13. And the partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu, having restored that expelled Bhikkhu, went to the Bhikkhus who had sentenced him to expulsion; having approached them, they said to the Bhikkhus who had pronounced that sentence: 'As regards that matter, friends, which gave origin to altercations among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to contentions, discord, quarrels, divisions among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to disunion among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to separations among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to schisms among the Sa<i>m</i>gha,--that Bhikkhu (who was concerned in that matter), having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been restored. Come, friends, let us declare now the re-establishment of concord among the Sa<i>m</i>gha in order to bring that matter to an end.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus who had pronounced that sentence of expulsion, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat down near him; sitting near him those Bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu have said to us: "As regards</p>  
 <p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a></p>  
 <p>that matter (&amp;c., down to:) in order to bring that matter to an end." What are we to do here, Lord?'</p>  
 <p>14. 'Since this Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been re-stored, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, O Bhikkhus, declare the re-establishment of concord in order to bring that matter to an end. And this declaration is to be performed in this way: Let all brethren assemble together, both the sick and the healthy; no one is allowed to send his declaration of kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">1</font></a> (and to stay away). When you have assembled, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following <i>ñ</i>atti before the Sa<i>m</i>gha: "Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. As regards that matter which gave origin to altercations among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to contentions, discord, quarrels, divisions among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to disunion among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to separations among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to schisms among the Sa<i>m</i>gha,--that Bhikkhu (concerned in that matter), having committed an offence, and having been sentenced to expulsion, has seen (his offence) and has been restored. If the Sa<i>m</i>gha is ready, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha declare the re-establishment of concord in order to bring that matter to an end. This is the <i>ñ</i>atti. Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me (&amp;c. <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">2</font></a>, down to:) the re-establishment of concord, in order to bring that matter to an end, has been declared by the Sa<i>m</i>gha; the division that existed among the Sa<i>m</i>gha has been settled; the disunion that existed</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p>  
 <p>among the Sa<i>m</i>gha has been settled. The Sa<i>m</i>gha is in favour (of this declaration); therefore you are silent; thus I understand." Then let the Sa<i>m</i>gha hold Uposatha and proclaim the Pâtimokkha.'</p>
