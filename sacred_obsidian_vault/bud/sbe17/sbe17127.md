 <p>1. So the Bhikkhu-Sa<i>m</i>gha, with Sâriputta and Moggallâna at their head, proceeded to the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill, and there carried out the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniyakamma against those Bhikkhus who were followers</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, to the intent that those Bhikkhus should no longer dwell on the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill. And they, when subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma, did not conduct themselves aright, they did not become subdued, they did not seek for release, they did not ask the Bhikkhus for forgiveness, they reviled them, they found fault with them <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">1</font></a>, saying that they were offending by acting in partiality, in ill-feeling, in folly, and in fear <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and they not only departed from the place, but also left the Order <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were offended, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, after having been subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma, refuse to conduct themselves aright (&amp;c., as before, down to) leave the Order?' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, after having been subjected by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma, refuse (&amp;c., as before, down to) leave the Order.?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>'How can those Bhikkhus who (&amp;c., as before, down to) leave the Order? This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, either to the conversion of the un-converted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to the unconverted being not converted, and to the turning back of those which have been converted.' And when the Blessed One had rebuked those Bhikkhus in various ways, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let not the Sa<i>m</i>gha revoke the Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya-kamma. There are five things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, from chapter 6, § 2, down to the end of chapter 7, reading Pabbâ<i>g</i>aniya for Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya):</p>
