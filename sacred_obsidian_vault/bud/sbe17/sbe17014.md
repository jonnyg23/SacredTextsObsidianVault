 <p>1. Now at that time the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana was staying in Avanti on the hill called the Precipice, near Kuraraghara <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And at that time the lay-disciple named So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">3</font></a> was the personal attendant upon the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana.</p>  
 <p>And the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a went to the place where the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana was, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And when he was thus seated, he said to the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana:</p>  
 <p>'As I understand the doctrine laid down by the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana, it is difficult for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fulness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection. I wish therefore to cut off my hair and beard, to clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and to go forth from the household life into the houseless state <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">4</font></a>. May the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana receive me into the Order of those who have renounced the world!'</p>  
 <p>2. 'Hard is it, So<i>n</i>a, your life long to live the</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>higher life using only one bed, and with but one meal a day. Do you, therefore, So<i>n</i>a, remain in the state of a householder, and practise only for a time the higher life, the precepts of the Buddhas, using only one bed, and with but one meal a day.'</p>  
 <p>Then the desire for renunciation <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a> which had arisen in the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a abated in him.</p>  
 <p>A second time the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a [made the same request, and received the same reply with the same result].</p>  
 <p>And a third time So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a made the same request. Then the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana conferred the pabba<i>g</i><i>g</i>â (ordination) on the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time in the Southern country and in Avanti there were but few Bhikkhus. And it was only after the lapse of three years that the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana was able, with difficulty, and with trouble, to get together a meeting of the Order in which ten Bhikkhus were present <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And then he admitted the venerable So<i>n</i>a into the higher rank of the Order.</p>  
 <p>3. Now when the venerable So<i>n</i>a had passed the rainy season there sprang up in his mind, when he was meditating alone, this thought:</p>  
 <p>'I have heard indeed that the Blessed One is such and such a one. But I have not as yet seen him face to face. I should like to go and visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha, if my superior would allow me.'</p>  
 <p>And in the evening the venerable So<i>n</i>a, leaving his solitude, went to the place where the venerable</p>

 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana was, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And when he was thus seated, he said to the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana:</p>  
 <p>4. 'When I was meditating alone, venerable Sir, the following thought occurred to my mind, "I have heard (&amp;c., as above)." Now I would go and visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha, if you, as my superior, allow it.'</p>  
 <p>'That is good, that is good, So<i>n</i>a! Go then, So<i>n</i>a, to visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha. [5.] You shall see, So<i>n</i>a, how the Blessed One arouses faith, is worthy of faith, calm in his senses, calm in his mind, gifted with the highest self-control and quietude, an elephant among men, subdued, guarded, with his senses in subjection to himself. Do you therefore, Soma, bow down in my name at the feet of the Blessed One, and say, "Lord! my superior, the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana, bows down in salutation at the feet of the Blessed One!" and add, "In the Southern country and in Avanti there are, Lord, but few Bhikkhus. And it was only after the lapse of three years that with difficulty and with trouble an assembly of the Order was got together, in which ten members were present, and I could be received into the higher rank of the Order. May the Blessed One be pleased, therefore, to allow the higher ordination in the Southern country and in Avanti before a meeting of a lesser number. [6.] In the Southern country and in Avanti, Lord, the soil is black on the surface <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a>, rough, and trampled by the feet of cattle <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> May the Blessed One be pleased, therefore, to allow the use, in the Southern country and in Avanti, of shoes with thick linings. In the Southern country and in Avanti, Lord, men attach great importance to bathing, and are pure by use of water. May the Blessed One be pleased to allow, in the Southern country and in Avanti, the constant use of the bath <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a>. In the Southern country and in Avanti, Lord, skins, such as sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins, are used as coverlets. Just as in the Middle country <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">2</font></a> the eragu, moragu, ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âru, and <i>g</i>antu grasses <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">3</font></a> are used for coverlets, so are sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins in the Southern country and in Avanti. May the Blessed One be pleased to allow the use of such coverlets there. [7.] At present, Lord, people are in the habit of giving a set of robes to Bhikkhus, who have left the district, saying, 'We give this set of robes to (a Bhikkhu) of such and such a name.' When they return, the Bhikkhus tell them, 'A set of robes has been given to you by a person of such and such a name.' But they, fearing to offend, do not accept it, saying, 'Let us not be guilty of a Nissaggiya.' May the Blessed One be pleased to make a detailed statement in the matter of robes."</p>

 <p>'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable So<i>n</i>a in assent to the venerable Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana, and, rising from his seat, he departed thence, keeping his right side towards him. And taking up his bed, he went on with his robe on, and his bowl in his hand to Sâvatthi.</p>  
 <p>8. And wandering from place to place he arrived at the place where the Blessed One was, at Sâvatthi in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's park. And when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat beside him.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda: 'Make ready a sleeping-place, Ânanda, for this Bhikkhu who has just arrived.' And the venerable Ânanda thought:</p>  
 <p>'Inasmuch as the Blessed One commands me to make ready a sleeping-place for the Bhikkhu who has just arrived, the Blessed One evidently desires to dwell in the same Vihâra with that Bhikkhu, he desires to dwell in the same Vihâra with the venerable So<i>n</i>a.' And he made ready a sleeping-place for the .venerable So<i>n</i>a at the place where the Blessed One was staying.</p>  
 <p>9. Then the Blessed One, after spending the greater part of the night in the open air, entered the Vihâra. And also the venerable So<i>n</i>a, having spent the greater part of the night in the open air, entered the Vihâra. And the Blessed One rose up, early in the morning, towards dawn, and requested the venerable So<i>n</i>a, saying,</p>  
 <p>'May the Dhamma so become clear to you that you may speak <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>.Even so, Lord!' said the venerable So<i>n</i>a in assent to the Blessed One; and he intoned all the verses in the Book of the Eights (A<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka-vaggikâni <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One, at the conclusion of the venerable So<i>n</i>a's recitation, expressed his pleasure, saying,</p>  
 <p>'Excellent, most excellent, O Bhikkhu! Well have the Eights been grasped by thee, well thought over, well learnt by heart: and with a fine voice art thou gifted, distinct, pleasant <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">2</font></a>, able to make things understood. How many years is it since thou hast been ordained?'</p>  
 <p>'One year, my Lord!'</p>  
 <p>10. 'But why have you postponed it so long?'</p>  
 <p>'’Tis long, Lord, since I saw into the danger of the passions, but life in a household is crowded with business and with cares.'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One, when he heard that matter, gave utterance at that time to the expression of emotion:</p>  
 <p>'When he has seen the danger of the world, when he has understood the Truth, when he has become free from Upadhi <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>'The pilgrim finds in sin no pleasure, his delight is in the word, the pure.'</p>  
 <p>11. Then thought the venerable So<i>n</i>a: 'The Blessed One is pleased with me. This then is the time which my superior spoke of.' And rising from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he bowed down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Lord! my superior Mahâ Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana bows down in salutation at the feet of the Blessed One. In the Southern country and in Avanti there are (&amp;c., as in §§ 4-7, down to the end of the message).'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection, having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus and said:</p>  
 <p>'The Southern country and Avanti has but few Bhikkhus. I allow the upasampadâ (ordination) in border countries to be held in a meeting of only four Bhikkhus, beside the chairman, who must be a Vinaya-dhara.'</p>  
 <p>12. 'In this passage the following are the border countries referred to <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">1</font></a>. To the East is the town Ka<i>g</i>aṅgala, and beyond it Mahâsâlâ. Beyond that is border country; this side of it is the Middle country. To the South-east is the river Salalavatî. Beyond that is border country; this side of it is the Middle country. To the South is the town Setaka<i>n</i><i>n</i>ika. Beyond that is border country; this side of it is the Middle country. To the West is the Brâhman district of Thûna. Beyond that is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>border country; this side of it is the Middle country. To the North is the mountain range called Usîradha<i>g</i>a. Beyond that is border country; this side of it is the Middle country. In such border countries, I allow, O Bhikkhus, the upasampadâ (ordination) to be held in a meeting of only four Bhikkhus, beside the chairman, who must be a Vinaya-dhara.</p>  
 <p>13. 'In the Southern country and in Avanti, O Bhikkhus, the soil is black on the surface and rough, and trampled by the feet of cattle. I allow the use, in all the border countries, O Bhikkhus, of shoes with thick linings.</p>  
 <p>'In the Southern country and in Avanti, O Bhikkhus, men attach great importance to bathing, and are pure by use of water. I allow the constant use of the bath, O Bhikkhus, in all the border countries.</p>  
 <p>'In the Southern country and in Avanti, O Bhikkhus, skins, such as sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins, are used as coverlets. Just as in the Middle country, Bhikkhus, the eragu, moragu, ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âru, and <i>g</i>antu grasses are used for coverlets, so in the Southern country and in Avanti are used skins, such as sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of skins, such as sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins, as coverlets, in all the border countries.</p>  
 <p>'There also, O Bhikkhus, people are in the habit of giving a set of robes to Bhikkhus who have left the district, saying, "We give this set of robes to (a Bhikkhu) with such and such a name." I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to accept such robes. The set of robes does not become subject to the ten-days'</p>
