 <p>1. At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels had arisen, in the dining-hall and amidst the houses, behaved</p>  
 <p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a></p>  
 <p>improperly towards each other in gesture and word, and came to blows.</p>  
 <p>The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can these Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, when altercations, contentions, and quarrels have arisen among them, &amp;c., and come to blows?' Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the Bhikkhus, when altercations, &amp;c.?'</p>  
 <p>These Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Having rebuked them, and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'When divisions have arisen among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, O Bhikkhus, and when unlawful conduct and unfriendliness prevail among the Bhikkhus, then you ought to sit down on your seats (separately, saying to yourselves): "At least we will not behave improperly towards each other in gesture or word, and will not come to blows." When divisions have arisen among the Sa<i>m</i>gha, O Bhikkhus, and when lawful conduct' and friendliness prevail among the Bhikkhus, then you may sit down (together), one by one from each side <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels had arisen, wounded each other with sharp words in the assemblies, and were unable to settle that question.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then a certain Bhikkhu went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted him, he stationed himself near him. Standing near him, that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, the Bhikkhus among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels have arisen, wound each other with sharp words in the assemblies, and are unable to settle that question. Pray, Lord, may the Blessed One go to those Bhikkhus out of compassion towards them.'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One went to the place where those Bhikkhus were; having approached them, he sat down on the seat they had prepared. Sitting there the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, no altercations, no contentions, no disunion, no quarrel!'</p>  
 <p>When he had spoken thus, a certain Bhikkhu, an adherer of the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, the king of Truth, be patient! Lord, may the Blessed One quietly enjoy the bliss he has obtained already in this life! The responsibility for these altercations and contentions, for this disunion and quarrel will rest with us alone.'</p>  
 <p>And for the second time the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c.' And for the second time that Bhikkhu who adhered to the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, &amp;c.' Then the Blessed One spoke thus to those Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>3. 'In former times, O Bhikkhus, there lived at</p>  
 <p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Benares a king of Kâsi, Brahmadatta by name, wealthy, rich in treasures, rich in revenues, rich in troops and vehicles, the lord over a great realm, with full treasuries and storehouses. And there was also a king of Kosala, Dîghîti by name, not wealthy, poor in treasures, poor in revenues, poor in troops and vehicles, the lord over a small realm, with empty treasuries and storehouses.</p>  
 <p>'And king Brahmadatta, O Bhikkhus, of Kâsi, having set the four hosts of his army in array, went out to war with king Dîghîti of Kosala.</p>  
 <p>'And king Dîghîti of Kosala heard, O Bhikkhus: "King Brahmadatta of Kâsi, having set the four hosts of his army in array, has gone out to war with me." Then king Dîghîti of Kosala thought, O Bhikkhus: "King Brahmadatta of Kâsi is wealthy, rich in treasures, &amp;c.; and I am not wealthy, poor in treasures, &amp;c. I am not able to stand against even one attack of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi. What if I were to flee from the town beforehand."</p>  
 <p>'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, took his queen-consort with him and fled from the town beforehand.</p>  
 <p>Then king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, conquered the troops and vehicles, the realm, the treasuries and storehouses of king Dîghîti of Kosala, and took possession of them.</p>  
 <p>And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, together with his consort, went forth to Benares. Wandering from place to place he came to Benares, and there at Benares, O Bhikkhus, king Dîghîti of Kosala dwelt, together with his consort, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. 'And ere long, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala became pregnant. And there came upon her the longing of pregnant women; and she desired, at sunrise, to see an army, with its four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and to drink the water in which the swords were washed.</p>  
 <p>'And the queen-consort, O Bhikkhus, of king Dîghîti of Kosala said to king Dîghîti of Kosala: "I am pregnant, Lord, and the longing of pregnancy has come upon me; and I desire, at sunrise, &amp;c."</p>  
 <p>'(The king replied): "Whence shall come, O queen, to people in distress like us, an army with four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and the water in which the swords are washed?"</p>  
 <p>'(The queen said): "If I do not obtain it, Lord, I shall die."</p>  
 <p>5. 'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a who was domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, was a friend of king Dîghîti of Kosala. And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, went to the place where that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, was; having approached him he said to that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "Your lady-friend, my beloved, is pregnant, and the longing of pregnant women has come upon her; and she desires (&amp;c., as above)."</p>  
 <p>'(The Brâhma<i>n</i>a replied): "Well, O king, let us see the queen also."</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala went to the place where that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta</p>  
 <p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Kâsi, was. And, O Bhikkhus, that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, saw the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala coming from afar. On seeing her he rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, raised his joined hands to the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala, and three times uttered this exclamation: "Verily a Kosala king dwells in thy womb! Verily a Kosala king dwells in thy womb!" (And further he said): "Do not despond, O queen, you will obtain the sight at sunrise of an army with its four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and you will obtain the drinking of the water in which the swords are washed."</p>  
 <p>6. And, O Bhikkhus, that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, went to the place where king Brahmadatta of Kâsi was. Having approached him, he said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "Lord, the signs that appear are such, that to-morrow at sunrise an army with four hosts, set in array, clad in armour, must station itself on auspicious ground, and the swords must be washed."</p>  
 <p>Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his attendants: "Do, my friends, what the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, my domestic chaplain, tells you."</p>  
 <p>'Thus, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala obtained the sight at sunrise, &amp;c., and the drinking of the water in which the swords were washed.</p>  
 <p>'And, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king Dîghîti of Kosala, when the child in her womb had reached maturity, gave birth to a boy. They called</p>  
 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>  
 <p>him Dîghâvu ("Longeval"). And ere long, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu came to the years of discretion.</p>  
 <p>7. 'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, thought: "This king Brahmadatta of Kâsi has done much harm to us. By him we have been robbed of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses. Should he find us out here, he will have us all three killed. What if I were to cause young Dîghâvu to dwell outside the town."</p>  
 <p>Then king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, caused young Dîghâvu to dwell outside the town. And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, dwelling outside the town, ere long learnt all arts.'</p>  
 <p>8. 'At that time, O Bhikkhus, the barber of king Dig-hid of Kosala dwelt at the court of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi. Now, O Bhikkhus, this barber of king Dîghîti of Kosala saw king Dîghîti of Kosala dwelling, together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic. When he had seen him, he went to the place where king Brahmadatta of Kâsi was, and having approached him, he said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "King Dîghîti of Kosala, Your Majesty, dwells, together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic."</p>  
 <p>9. Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his attendants: "Well, my friends, bring king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort before me."</p>  
 <p>And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying),</p>  
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "Yes, Your Majesty," and brought king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort before him.</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave order to his attendants: "Well, my friends, bind king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort firmly with strong ropes, tie their arms to their backs, have them close shaven, lead them around with loud beatings of drums from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way, then lead them out of the town by the southern gate, hew them in four pieces to the south of the town, and throw the pieces away to the four quarters."</p>  
 <p>'And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," bound king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort firmly with strong ropes, tied their arms to their backs, had them close shaven, and led them around with loud beatings of drums from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way.</p>  
 <p>10. 'Now, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu thought "For a long time I have not seen my father and mother. What if I were to go and see my father and mother." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, entered Benares, and saw his father and mother, bound firmly with strong ropes, their arms tied to their backs, close shaven, and being led around with loud beating of drums from "road to road and from cross-way to cross-way. When he saw that, he went up to his father and mother.</p>  
 <p>'And king Dîghîti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, saw young Dîghâvu coming from afar; seeing young Dîghâvu he said to him: "Do not look long, my dear Dîghâvu, and do not look short <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For not by</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a></p>  
 <p>hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, hatred is appeased."</p>  
 <p>11. 'When he had spoken thus, O Bhikkhus, the people said to king Dîghîti of Kosala: "This king Dîghîti of Kosala is mad and raves. What has this Dîghâvu to do with him? Who is he to whom he says: Do not look long, &amp;c.?'" (Dîghîti replied): "I am not mad, my friends, nor do I rave. 'He who is clever will understand it."</p>  
 <p>'And for the second time, &amp;c. And for the third time, O Bhikkhus, king Dîghîti of Kosala said to young- Dîghâvu, &amp;c. And for the third time said the people (&amp;c., down to:) "He who is clever will understand it."</p>  
 <p>'Then those people, O Bhikkhus, having led king Dîghîti of Kosala and his consort around from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way, led them out of the town by the southern gate, hewed them in four pieces to the south of the town, threw the pieces away to the four quarters, stationed there a troop of soldiers, and went away.</p>  
 <p>12. 'Then young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, went to Benares, got strong drink there, and made those soldiers drink it. When they were drunk and had fallen down, he gathered the pieces (of the two bodies), made a funeral pile, put his father's and his mother's bodies on that pile, set it on fire, and raising his clasped hands he three times circumambulated the funeral pile.</p>  
 <p>'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi had gone up on to the terrace of his splendid palace. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, saw young Dîghâvu, who, raising his clasped 'hands, three times circumambulated the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a></p>  
 <p>funeral pile. When he saw that, he thought: "Doubtless this man is a relation or kinsman of king Dîghîti of Kosala. Alas for my misfortune, that nobody will tell me (what this means)!"</p>  
 <p>13. 'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, went to the forest. There he cried and wept to his heart's content. Then he wiped his tears, entered the town of Benares, went to the elephant stables near the royal palace, and said to the elephant trainer: "I wish to learn your art, master."</p>  
 <p>'"Well, my good young man, learn it."</p>  
 <p>'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, arose in the night, at dawn's time, and sung in the elephant stables in a beautiful voice, and played upon the lute. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, having risen in the night, at dawn, heard that singing in a beautiful voice and that playing upon the lute in the elephant stables. On hearing that he asked his attendants: "Who is it, my friends, who has risen in the night, at dawn's time, and has sung in the elephant stables in so beautiful a voice, and has played upon the lute?"</p>  
 <p>14. '(The attendants replied): "A young pupil, Your Majesty, of such and such an elephant trainer, has risen in the night, at dawn, and has sung it the elephant stables in so beautiful a voice, and has played upon the lute."</p>  
 <p>'(The king said): "Well, my friends, bring that young man to me."</p>  
 <p>'Those people accepted, O Bhikkhus, that order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," and brought young Dîghâvu to him.</p>  
 <p>'"Is it you, my good young man, who has risen in the night, &amp;c.?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p>  
 <p>'"Well, my good young man, sing and play upon the lute (also before me)."</p>  
 <p>'Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," and in order to win (the king's) favour he sung in a beautiful voice and played upon the lute.</p>  
 <p>'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Be my attendant, my good young man."</p>  
 <p>'Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, became (a servant) of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, rising before him, lying down after him, willingly obeying all his commands, agreeable in his conduct, pleasing in his words. And ere long, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi gave to young Dîghâvu an intimate position of trust.</p>  
 <p>15. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Well, my young friend, put the horses to the chariot; we will go a-hunting." And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," put the horses to the chariot, and said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "The horses have been put to your chariot, Your Majesty; you may do now as you think fit."</p>  
 <p>'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, ascended the chariot, and young Dîghâvu drove the chariot: and he drove the chariot in such a way that the hosts (of the royal retinue) went one way, and the chariot went another way.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a></p>  
 <p>And after a long drive, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi said to young Dîghâvu: "Well, my young friend, stop now the chariot. I am tired; I would lie down."</p>  
 <p>Young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," stopped the chariot, and sat down on the ground cross-legged. And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, lay down, laying his head in the lap of young Dîghâvu; and as he was tired, he fell asleep in a moment.</p>  
 <p>16. 'And young Dîghâvu thought, O Bhikkhus: "This king Brahmadatta of Kâsi has done much harm to us. By him we have been robbed of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses. And he has killed my father and mother. Now the time has come to me to satisfy my hatred,"--(thinking thus) he unsheathed his sword. Then, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu thought: "My father said to me in the hour of his death: 'Do not look long, my dear Dîghâvu, and do not look short. For not by hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, hatred is appeased.' It would not become me to transgress my father's word,"--(thinking thus) he put up his sword.</p>  
 <p>And for the second time . . . . and for the third time young Dîghâvu thought, O Bhikkhus: "This king Brahmadatta of Kâsi has done much harm to us" (&amp;c., down to:)--(thinking thus) he put up his sword.</p>  
 <p>At that moment, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, frightened, terrified, full of anguish, and alarmed, suddenly arose.</p>  
 <p>'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, said to king</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "Why do you arise so suddenly, O king, frightened, terrified, full of anguish and alarmed?"</p>  
 <p>'(The king replied): "I dreamt, my young friend, that young Dîghâvu, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala, came upon me with his sword; therefore have I arisen so suddenly, frightened, terrified, full of anguish, and alarmed."</p>  
 <p>17. 'Then, O Bhikkhus, young Dîghâvu, stroking with his left hand the head of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, and with his right hand unsheathing his sword, said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "I am that young Dîghâvu, O king, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala. You have done much harm to us. By you we have been robbed of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses. And you have killed my father and mother. Now the time has come to me to satisfy my hatred."</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi fell down before young Dîghâvu, inclining his head to his feet, and said to young Dîghâvu: "Grant me my life, my dear Dîghâvu! Grant me my life, my dear Dîghâvu!"</p>  
 <p>"How can I grant you your life, O king? It is you, O king, who should grant me my life!"</p>  
 <p>'"Well, my dear Dîghâvu, then grant me my life, and I will grant you your life."</p>  
 <p>Thus, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kâsi and young Dîghâvu granted each other their lives and took each other's hands and swore an oath not to do any harm to each other.</p>  
 <p>'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Well, my dear Dîghâvu, put now the horses to the chariot; we will go."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And young Dîghâvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kâsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," put the horses to the chariot, and said to king Brahmadatta of Kâsi: "The horses have been put to your chariot, Your Majesty; you may do now as you think fit."</p>  
 <p>'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, ascended the chariot, and young Dîghâvu drove the chariot; and he drove the chariot in such a way that they soon reached again the hosts (of the royal retinue).</p>  
 <p>18. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, having entered Benares, convoked his ministers and counsellors and said to them: "If you should see, my good Sirs, young Dîghâvu, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala, what would you do to him?"</p>  
 <p>'Some (of the ministers) replied: "We would cut off his hands, Your Majesty;" (others said): "We would cut off his feet"--"We would cut off his hands and feet"--"We would cut off his ears"--"We would cut off his nose"--"We would cut off his ears and his nose"--"We would cut off his head."</p>  
 <p>'"This is young Dîghâvu, Sirs, the son of king Dîghîti of Kosala. It is not permitted to do any-thing to him; he has granted me my life, and I have granted him his life."</p>  
 <p>19. 'And king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, said to young Dîghâvu: "Why did your father say to you in the hour of his death: 'Do not look long, &amp;c.'--what did your father mean by that?"</p>  
 <p>'What my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'Not long'--(means): 'Let not your hatred last long;' this did my father mean when he said in the hour of his death: 'Not long.' And</p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p>what my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'Not short'--(means): 'Do not be hasty to fall out with your friends;' this did my father mean when he said in the hour of his death: 'Not short.' And what my father said, O king, in the hour of his death: 'For not by hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear Dîghâvu, is hatred appeased'--(means this): 'You have killed my father and mother, O king. If I should deprive you therefore of life, O king, then your partisans, O king, would deprive me of life; my partisans again would deprive those of life. Thus by hatred that hatred would not be appeased. But now, O king, you have granted me my life, and I, O king, have granted you your life; thus by not-hatred hatred has been appeased.' This did my father mean when he said in the hour of his death: 'For not by hatred, &amp;c.'"</p>  
 <p>20. 'Then king Brahmadatta of Kâsi, O Bhikkhus, thought: "O wonderful! O marvellous! How clever is this young Dîghâvu, that he understands in its full extent the meaning of what his father spoke so concisely,"--and he gave him back his father's troops and vehicles, his realm, his treasuries and storehouses, and he gave him his daughter,</p>  
 <p>'Now, O Bhikkhus, if such is the forbearance and mildness of kings who wield the sceptre and bear the sword, so much more, O Bhikkhus, must you so let your light shine before the world that you, having embraced the religious life according to so well-taught a doctrine and a discipline, are seen to be forbearing and mild.'</p>  
 <p>And for the third time <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">1</font></a> the Blessed One thus</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, no altercations, no contentions, no disunion, no quarrels!'</p>  
 <p>And for the third time that Bhikkhu who adhered to the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, the king of Truth, be patient! Lord, may the Blessed One quietly enjoy the bliss he has obtained already in this life! The responsibility for these altercations and contentions, for this disunion and quarrel will rest with us alone.' And the Blessed One thought: 'Truly these fools are infatuate; it is no easy task to administer instruction to them,'--and he rose from his seat and went away.</p>
