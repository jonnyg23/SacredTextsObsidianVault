 <h2 align="center">VII. <i>G</i>ÂLIYA SUTTA.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="center">[IS THE SOUL DISTINCT FROM THE BODY?]</h3>
 
 <p>   [<i>This Sutta having been incorporated, word for word, as</i> <a href="dob-06tx.htm#p.%20202">§§ 15-19</a>, <i>inclusive, in the last Sutta, the reader is referred to the translation given there.</i></p>
 
 <p>   The Mahâli Sutta must have already included, when the Dîgha was put together, this <i>G</i>âliya episode. For there would otherwise be no reason for the Mahâli Sutta being put into the Sîlakkhanda Vagga, the Sîlas being contained only in that episode.</p>
 
 <p>   Why then should the episode appear also again, in full, as a separate Sutta? Is it merely because of the importance of the question? We have another instance of a similar kind, where the episode of Nigrodha's question, only referred to at § 23 of the Kassapa-Sîhanâda Sutta, is set out afterwards, in full, in the Udumbarîka Sîhanâda Sutta (No. 25 in the Dîgha). But there the whole episode is not given twice in full. Such cross-references are fairly frequent in the Pi<i>t</i>akas, and are of importance for the history of the literature. One of the most striking cases is where the Sa<i>m</i>yutta quotes a Sutta, now contained in the Dîgha, by name. (Sakka-pa<i>ñh</i>a Sutta, S. III, 13; compare Sum. I, 51; Mil. 350.)]</p>
