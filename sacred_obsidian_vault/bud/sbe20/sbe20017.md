 <p>1. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus</p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>used to wear ear-rings <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and ear-drops <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and strings of beads for the throat, and girdles of beads <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and bangles <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and necklaces <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and bracelets, and rings.</p>  
 <p>The people murmured, &amp;c. . . . . The Bhikkhus heard, &amp;c. . . . . They told the, Blessed One (&amp;c., as in II, 1, 1, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear any of these things. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>2. [A similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long hair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, hair that is two months old, or two inches long.'</p>  
 <p>3. [Similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to smooth <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">6</font></a> the hair</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a></p>  
 <p>with a comb, or with a smoothing instrument shaped like a snake's hood <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or with the hand used as such an instrument <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or with pomade <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or with hair-oil of beeswax <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>4. [Similar paragraph concluding]</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to look at the image of your faces in a looking-glass, or a bowl of water <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore in his face. He asked the Bhikkhus what kind of a sore he had. 'Such and such a kind of sore,' replied they. He did not believe what they said. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of a disease, to look at your faces in a looking-glass, or in a bowl of water.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c., down to)</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a></p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to anoint your faces, nor to rub (ointment, &amp;c.) into your faces, nor to put chunam on your faces, nor to smear red arsenic on your faces, nor to paint your bodies, nor to paint your faces <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had disease in his eyes. They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to anoint your faces.'</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now at that time there was a festival on the mountain-top <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">3</font></a> at Râ<i>g</i>agaha; and the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus went to see it.</p>  
 <p>The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go to see dancing, and singing, and music, like those who are still enjoying the pleasures of the world?' And they told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to go to see dancing, or singing, or music. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_130"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_134">69:1</a> Vallikâ ti ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>ato nikkhanta-mutt-olambakâdîna<i>m</i> eta<i>m</i> adhiva<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i>. Na kevala<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a vallikâ eva, ya<i>m</i> ki<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>i ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-pilandhana<i>m</i> antamaso tâla-panna<i>m</i> pi na va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati (B.). Compare satavallika<i>m</i> at V, 29, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_131"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_135">69:2</a> Pâmaṅga. The meaning of which is not clear from Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit. It occurs also at Dîpava<i>m</i>sa XII, 1, and below in Buddhaghosa's note on maddavi<i>n</i>a at V, 29, 2 (twice).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_136">69:3</a> Ka<i>t</i>i-suttaka<i>m</i>. This is not mentioned in the similar paragraph at V, 29, 2, where all special kinds of girdles are enumerated. It is forbidden below to the Bhikkhunîs at X, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_133"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_137">69:4</a> Ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>ika. This word is explained by Buddhaghosa as the same as valaya<i>m</i>. Ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>iya occurs, apparently in a different sense, at Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5, and the present word in Buddhaghosa on sata-vallika<i>m</i> at V, 29, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_134"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_138">69:5</a> Kâyura, on which Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., merely says that the meaning of this, and of the following words, is evident. But the <i>G</i>âtaka commentary (Fausböll III, 437, 14) says kâyûan ti gîvâya pilandhana-pasâdhana<i>m</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_135"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_139">69:6</a> Osa<i>n</i>heti. Compare the Sanskrit <i>s</i>laksh<i>n</i>ayati. The art of hair-dressing had, at the time when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was composed, been already carried to a high state of efficiency in the valley of the Ganges, as may reasonably be concluded from the numerous kinds of headdresses figured in bas-relief on some of the oldest Buddhist sculptures.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_136"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_140">70:1</a> Pha<i>n</i>akenâ ti dantamayâdisu yena kena<i>k</i>i (B.).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_137"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_141">70:2</a> Hattha-pha<i>n</i>akenâ ti hatthen’ eva pha<i>n</i>aka-ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i> karonti, aṅgulîhi osa<i>n</i>henti (B.). It is clear from this last explanation that the pha<i>n</i>aka was a kind of very primitive brush, but without bristles. In passing the fingers through the hair the fingers are naturally held separate, slightly forward, and stiff--precisely as one would hold them if one wished to imitate the hood of a cobra. To make a real brush with bristles was evidently beyond the mechanical appliances of those times, or such an article would certainly have been mentioned in this connection.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_138"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_143">70:3</a> On the use of Telaka, compare Mahâvagga VI, 13, I, and Sittha-telaka at <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 3, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_139"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_144">70:4</a> Compare <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 10, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_140"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_145">71:1</a> All these practices are seriatim forbidden to the Bhikkhunîs also in <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 10, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_141"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_146">71:2</a> The following section recurs, almost word for word, of the Bhikkhunîs, in the Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya X (Sutta-vibhaṅga, vol. ii, p. 267).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_142"></a><a href="sbe20017.htm#fr_147">71:3</a> Giragga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. Compare Dîpava<i>m</i>sa XXI, 32, and Mahâva<i>m</i>sa, p. 214, line 2. It occurs also in the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibhaṅga on the 37th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya, and Buddhaghosa there explains it as follows: Giragga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o ti girimhi agga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o girissa vâ agga-dese sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o. He is evidently in doubt about the word, which is probably connected with ancient local worship or custom, a worship in high-places, as little allied to Vedic Brahmanism as it was to Buddhism.</p>
