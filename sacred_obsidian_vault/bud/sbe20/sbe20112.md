 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhunîs had themselves carried in vehicles to which cows were yoked with a bull between them <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or bulls were yoked with a cow between them. People were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying: 'That is what is done at the feast of the Gaṅgâ, and the Mali <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to be carried in a vehicle. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according to law <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî was sick, and unable to go on foot.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow the use of a carriage, O Bhikkhus, to a sick (Bhikkhunî) <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>Now the Bhikkhunîs thought: 'Should the carts be yoked with cows or bulls?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a cart yoked with cows or bulls, or drawn by hand <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî was much distressed by the jolting of the cart.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a litter or sedan chair <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>
