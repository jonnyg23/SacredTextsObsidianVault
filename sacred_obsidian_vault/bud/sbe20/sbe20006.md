 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhu Gagga was insane and out of his mind; and by him, when so insane and out of his mind, many things unworthy of a sama<i>n</i>a had been committed, as well in speech as in act <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">3</font></a>. The Bhikkhus warned the Bhikkhu Gagga of a fault so committed by him when insane and out of his mind, saying, 'Does the venerable one call to</p>

 <p>mind that he has committed such and such an offence?'</p>  
 <p>He replied, 'I, my friends, was insane and out of my mind. (No doubt) many things unworthy of a sama<i>n</i>a, as well in speech as in act, may have been committed by me when so insane and out of my mind. But I do not recollect it. It was done by me by reason of my insanity.'</p>  
 <p>But though they received that answer from him <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they warned him still, saying, 'Does the venerable one call to mind that he has committed such and such an offence?'</p>  
 <p>'Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, "How can those Bhikkhus warn the Bhikkhu Gagga . . . saying . . . such and such an offence?" And when he replies, "I, my friends, was insane . . . by reason of my insanity"--how can those Bhikkhus still warn him, saying . . . of such and such an offence?'</p>  
 <p>And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) such and such an offence?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>

 <p>2. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be granted.</p>  
 <p>'Let that Bhikkhu Gagga [here follow the words of the formal request, of the resolution, and of the grant by decision of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, exactly in the same way as in the last case, chapter 4, § 10].'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_33"></a><a href="sbe20006.htm#fr_34">18:2</a> The particular decision given in this chapter for the particular case is elaborated in chap. 14, § 28 below into a general rule for every similar case.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_34"></a><a href="sbe20006.htm#fr_35">18:3</a> Buddhaghosa explains this word as follows: 'Bhâsitaparikantan ti vi<i>k</i>âya bhâsita<i>m</i> kâyena parikkanta<i>m</i> parikkametvâ katan ti attho.' The similar word Parikanta<i>m</i>, which occurs in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pârâ<i>g</i>ika IV, 1, 2, in the sense of lacerated, is from the root k<i>ri</i>nt.</p>
