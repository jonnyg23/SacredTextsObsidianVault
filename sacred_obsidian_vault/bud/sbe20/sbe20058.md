 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had stayed as long as he thought fit at Vesâlî he set out towards Sâvatthi.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the pupils of the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus went on in front of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha which had the Buddha at its head, and occupied the rooms, and occupied the sleeping-places, saying, 'This will do for our superiors (upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âyas), this for our teachers (â<i>k</i>ariyas), this for ourselves.' And the venerable Sâriputta who had followed after the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha which had the Buddha at its head, since all the rooms and all the sleeping-places had been occupied, found no place to sleep in, and took his seat at the foot of a certain tree.</p>  
 <p>Now the Blessed One, at early dawn, after he had risen, coughed. The venerable Sâriputta coughed also.</p>  
 <p>'Who is this?' (said the Blessed One.)</p>  
 <p>'It is I, Lord; Sâriputta.'</p>  
 <p>'How do you come to be sitting here, Sâriputta?'</p>  
 <p>Then the venerable Sâriputta told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>2. Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked, 'Is it true, as I have been told, O Bhikkhus, that the pupils of the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus have (acted in this way)?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One rebuked them, saying (as usual, see <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 2, 3), and he said to the Bhikkhus, 'Who is it, O Bhikkhus, who is worthy of the best seat, and the best water, and the best food?'</p>  
 <p>Some of the Bhikkhus said, 'One who belonged to a Kshatriya family before he entered the Order.' Others of the Bhikkhus said, One who belonged to a Brahman family before he entered the Order.' Others again said, 'One who belonged to a</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Gahapati <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">1</font></a> family before he entered the Order--one versed in the Suttas--one versed in the Rules of the Order--an expounder of the Dhamma <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">2</font></a>--one who has attained the first, second, third, fourth <i>Gh</i>âna--one who has entered the first, second, third Path--an Arahat--one who has the threefold wisdom <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">3</font></a>--one who has the six powers <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Long ago, O Bhikkhus, there was a great banyan tree on the lower slopes of the Himâlaya range; and near it there dwelt three friends--a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant. And they dwelt together without mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Then, O Bhikkhus, it occurred to those friends, "Come now, let us find out which of us is the elder by birth; and let us agree to honour and reverence and esteem and support him, and by his counsels let us abide." So, Bhikkhus, the partridge and the monkey asked the elephant,</p>  
 <p>'"How far back can you, friend, remember?"</p>  
 <p>'"Friends! when I was little I used to walk over</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and its topmost twig brushed against my stomach. So far back, friends, can I remember."</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, the partridge and the elephant asked the monkey [the same question],</p>  
 <p>'"Friends! when I was little, sitting once on the ground, I gnawed at the then topmost twig of this banyan. So far back can I remember."</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, the monkey and the elephant asked the partridge [the same question],</p>  
 <p>'"Friends! there was formerly a lofty banyan tree in yonder open space. One day after eating one of its fruits, I voided the seed here; and from that this banyan tree grew up. So I must be older than either of you."</p>  
 <p>'Thereupon, O Bhikkhus, the elephant and the monkey said to the partridge, "You, friend, are the oldest of us all. Henceforth we will honour and reverence and esteem and support you, and by your counsels will we abide."</p>  
 <p>'Thenceforth, O Bhikkhus, the partridge kept the monkey and the elephant in obedience to the Five Precepts, and observed them also himself. And dwelling together in mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy, at the dissolution of the body after death they were reborn unto a happy state in heaven. And this (perfect life of theirs) became known as "the good life of the partridge <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p></p><dir>’Tis those who reverence the old<br> That are the men who Dhamma know, <a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a><br> Worthy of praise while in this life<br> And happy in the life to come.</dir>  
 <p>4. 'So that, O Bhikkhus, since even animals can live together in mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy, so much more, O Bhikkhus, should you so let your light shine forth <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">1</font></a> that you, who have left the world to follow so well taught a doctrine and discipline, may be seen to dwell in like manner together.' And when he had delivered a religious discourse (as in I, 1, 3), he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, that paying of reverence, rising up in reverence, salutation, proper respect, and apportionment of the best seat and water and food, shall be according to seniority. But property belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha shall not be exclusively appropriated according to seniority <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.</p>  
 <p>5. 'These ten, O Bhikkhus, are not to be saluted--a Bhikkhu afterwards admitted unto the higher grade of the Order by one previously admitted--a person not admitted--a senior Bhikkhu when he belongs to a different community, and does not speak according to the Dhamma--a woman <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">3</font></a>--a eunuch <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">4</font></a>--a Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">5</font></a>--one who, having been so placed, is</p>

 <p>liable to be thrown back to the beginning of his probationary term <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">1</font></a>--one who is liable to have a penance (Mânatta) imposed upon him--one who is undergoing a penance--one who, so undergoing a penance, is fit to be rehabilitated.</p>  
 <p>'And these three, O Bhikkhus, ought to be saluted--one previously admitted into the higher grade of the Order by one afterwards admitted--the senior in a different community when he speaks according to the Dhamma--and, O Bhikkhus, throughout the worlds of men and gods, of Mâras and of Brahmas, by all creatures Sama<i>n</i>as and Brahmans, gods and men, the Arahat Sammâsambuddha.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe20058.htm#fr_559">191:2</a> The incident related in the following chapter is identical with the 37th <i>G</i>âtaka (including the Introductory Story there given) already translated by Rh. D. in the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 310-314.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe20058.htm#fr_560">193:1</a> On this mention of gahapati as the name of a caste or rank, compare the passage in the Tevi<i>g</i><i>g</i>a Sutta I, 47 = Sâma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>aphala Sutta, p. 133 (translated by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli,' S.B.E. vol. xi, p. 187), where the word is opposed to a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atarasmi<i>m</i> kule pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>â<i>g</i>âto.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe20058.htm#fr_561">193:2</a> Dhamma is here possibly already used in the special sense to which the term Abhidhamma was afterwards applied. So Pu<i>n</i><i>n</i>a, who in the Aṅguttara Nikâya I, 14, is called the chief of the expounders of the Dhamma (compare Dîpava<i>m</i>sa IV, 4), says of himself in the Apadâna abhidhammanaya<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>o ’ha<i>m</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="sbe20058.htm#fr_567">195:2</a> Compare chapter and also chapter 12. It would seem from these passages that the prohibition to reserve exclusively according to seniority the use of property belonging to the whole Sa<i>m</i>gha was held to imply that the temporary use of it was to go according to seniority.
