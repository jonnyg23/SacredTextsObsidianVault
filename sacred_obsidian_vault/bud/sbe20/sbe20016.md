 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the Bamboo Grove, in the Kalandaka Nivâpa. And at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, used to rub <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a> their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against wood. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as do so, like wrestlers, boxers, or shampooers <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a>?' The Bhikkhus heard the people so murmuring, &amp;c.; and they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, having convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is this true, O Bhikkhus, what they say, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, rub (&amp;c., as before)?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>

 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as usual, see I, 1, 2, down to the end).' And when he had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'A Bhikkhu, when bathing, is not, O Bhikkhus, to rub his body against wood. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus: when bathing, used to rub their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against a pillar--against a wall (&amp;c., as in last section, down to the end).</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to bathe on an A<i>t</i><i>t</i>âna (a sort of shampooing stand <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>). The people (&amp;c., as before). The Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before). Then the Blessed One (&amp;c., as before, down to) addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not to bathe, O Bhikkhus, on an A<i>t</i><i>t</i>âna.

 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_123">66:1</a> Uggha<i>m</i>seti. The simple verb occurs below, V, 9, 2, 4, X, 10, 2, and at <i>G</i>âtaka, vol. i, p. 190. It is the Sanskrit root gharsh.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_124">66:2</a> On malla-mu<i>t</i><i>th</i>ikâ Buddhaghosa merely says mu<i>t</i><i>th</i>ika-mallâ. His note on gâma-poddavâ (already given by H.O. at p. 3.15 of the edition to the text) says, 'town’s people given to adorning themselves by painting their skin' (on which compare below, V, 2, 5). But it is difficult to see how that fits in with the connection here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_125">67:1</a> So Buddhaghosa loc. cit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_126">67:2</a> A wooden instrument in the shape of a hand, which was firs; covered with chunam (fine lime), and then rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_127">67:3</a> Apparently a string of beads which was first covered with the chunam made from Kuruvindaka stone (a ruby-coloured stone), and then held at both ends and rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_128">67:4</a> As Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this by 'rubbing their <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a> bodies up against each other'(!), vigayha has here probably nothing to do with gâh, but is simply vig<i>ri</i>hya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_126"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_130">68:1</a> A kind of back-scratcher, made according to Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., by placing together, by the roots, hooks made of the teeth of crocodiles (makara-dantaka; see V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 2), which had previously been split. Such hooks of split crocodiles' teeth are mentioned in the text itself below, V, 9, 2; and pins or hooks made of raga's teeth at V, 9, 5, and VI, 3, 5 (nâga-dantaka), and V, It, 7 (nâga-danta).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_127"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_131">68:2</a> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., makes this phrase mean only 'made of teeth that had not been previously split.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_128"></a><a href="sbe20016.htm#fr_132">68:3</a> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this word by vattova<i>t</i><i>t</i>i; which is to us equally unintelligible.</p>
