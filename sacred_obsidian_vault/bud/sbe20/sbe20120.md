 <p>1. Now at that time, a century <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">1</font></a> after the death of the Blessed One, the Bhikkhus of Vesâlî, Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ians, promulgated at Vesâlî the ten theses:--(1) that storing salt in a horn vessel was permissible; (2) that the midday meal might be eaten when the sun's shadow showed two finger breadths after noon; (3) that he who intends to go into the village could begin to eat again after he had once left off; (4) that a number of Bhikkhus residing within the same boundary might hold Uposatha separately; (5) that a Sa<i>m</i>gha not at unity within itself might carry out an official act, undertaking to inform Bhikkhus of it; (6) that it was permissible for a Bhikkhu to do anything adopted as a practice by his Upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âya; (7) that curds might be eaten by one who had already finished his midday meal; (8) that it was permissible to drink unfermented toddy; (9) that a rug or mat need not be of the limited size prescribed if it had no fringe; (10) that it was permissible to receive gold and silver <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 387</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, who was wandering through the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian country, arrived at Vesâlî; and there the venerable Yasa stayed at the Mahâvana, in the Kû<i>t</i>âgâra Hall.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî, on Uposatha day, filled a copper pot with water and placed it in the midst of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and said to such of their Vesâlian lay disciples as came there: 'Give, Sirs, to the Sa<i>m</i>gha a kahâpa<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or half a one, or a pâda, or a mâsaka. It will be wanted for the Sa<i>m</i>gha, for the provision of various utensils.'</p>  
 <p>When they had thus spoken, the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, said to the lay disciples: 'Do, Sirs, nothing of the kind. The use of gold and silver is not allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as neither allow it to be given to them, nor take charge of it. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as are men whose gems and jewelry have been laid aside, and who are without silver and without gold.'</p>  
 <p>Though the lay disciples from Vesâlî had been thus addressed by the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, they gave money to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî, at the close of the night, reserving one portion <a name="fr_994"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">2</font></a>, divided that money according to the number of the Bhikkhus. And they said to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka:</p>  
 <p>'This, friend Yasa, is thy due portion of the money.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 388</font></a></p>  
 <p>'I have no due portion in that money. I do not allow any money to be given to me.'</p>  
 <p>2. Then the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî said one to another: 'This brother, Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, upbraids and reviles, and renders dissatisfied believing and faithful followers. Come, let us carry out against him the Act of Reconciliation <a name="fr_995"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' And they did so.</p>  
 <p>Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, said to them: 'It has been laid down, Sirs, by the Blessed One, that a companion shall be appointed to go as messenger with a Bhikkhu against whom the Act of Reconciliation has been carried out <a name="fr_996"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Appoint, Sirs, a Bhikkhu, as companion messenger to me.' And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî deputed a Bhikkhu to that work, and gave him as a companion messenger to the venerable Yasa.</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Yasa, taking the companion Bhikkhu with him, entered into Vesâlî, and said to the believing laymen there:</p>  
 <p>'I am said, Sirs, to be upbraiding and reviling, and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, thereby that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma, and what is against the Vinaya to be against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya to be Vinaya.</p>  
 <p>3. 'Now the Blessed One was once, Sirs, staying at Sâvatthi in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's pleasure-ground. And there, Sirs, the Blessed One exhorted the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 389</font></a></p>  
 <p>'"There are, O Bhikkhus, four obstructions of the sun and moon, by which when the sun and moon are affected, they give no heat and they give no light, and they are no longer glorious. And what are the four? They are clouds and fog and dusty smoke and Râhu <a name="fr_997"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">1</font></a>, by which when the sun and the moon are affected they give neither heat nor light nor sheen. Just so, O Bhikkhus, there are four stains by which when Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans are affected they give neither heat nor light nor sheen. And what are the four? There are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans who drink strong drink, and things intoxicating, abstaining not therefrom <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This is the first of such stains. And further, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans who practise sexual intercourse, and abstain not therefrom. This is the second of such stains. And further, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans who accept silver and gold, abstaining not from the use thereof. This is the third of such stains. And lastly, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans who gain their livelihood by low arts <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">3</font></a>, abstaining not from such means of life. This is the fourth of such stains."</p>  
 <p>'Thus spoke, Sirs, the Blessed One: and when the Happy One had thus spoken, the Master further said:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p></p><dir>'"Stained by lust and malice, some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans, <a name="page_390"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 390</font></a><br> Men blinded by ignorance, praise things that seem to have delight.<br> Strong drink they drink and fierce, indulge in sensual acts,<br> Devoid of wisdom, silver and gold they take.<br> And by low arts some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans live.<br> Stains are such actions called by the Buddha of the Solar race,<br> Stains--by which defiled some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhmans,<br> Impure brutes and unclean, give neither heat nor light.<br> Covered rather by darkness, purblind, enslaved by craving lusts,<br> They enlarge the realm of death <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and dread rebirth they gain."</dir>  
 <p>'It is for upholding this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; what is against the Vinaya to be against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya to be Vinaya.</p>  
 <p>4. 'And once the Blessed One was staying, Sirs, at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, at the Kalandaka Nivâpa. Now at that time among the royal attendants sitting together in the women's apartment in the palace, the following saying was heard: "Silver and gold is allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 391</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as accept it, and take it in charge." Now at that time Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, a village headman, was present. And he said to the people there: "Say not so, Sirs. Neither is silver and gold allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, nor do they accept it, nor take it in charge. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as are men who have laid aside gems and jewelry, and are without silver, and without gold." And the headman, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, succeeded in satisfying them.</p>  
 <p>'Then the headman, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, went to the place where the Blessed One was and saluted him, and took his seat on one side. And he told the Blessed One the whole matter <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and said:</p>  
 <p>'"Now am I, Lord, in maintaining as I did, one who speaks according to the word of the Blessed One, one who does not falsely represent the Blessed One, one who does not put forth minor matters in the place of the true Dhamma? And is there anything that leads to blame in such discussion, this way and that, as touching the observance of the rules of the order <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">2</font></a>?"</p>  
 <p>'"Most certainly, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, in maintaining thus you speak in accordance with my word, and do not represent me falsely, nor put forth minor matters as the true Dhamma. Nor is there any thing leading to blame in such discussions. For gold and silver is not allowed, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, nor ought they to accept it, nor take it in charge. Men who have laid aside gems and jewelry are the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 392</font></a></p>  
 <p>men without silver and without gold. For to whomsoever, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, gold and silver are allowed, to him also the five kinds of sensual pleasure <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">1</font></a> are allowed. And to whomsoever these five kinds of pleasure are allowed, him you may know of a certainty to be following neither the rule of the Sama<i>n</i>as, nor the rule of the sons of Sâkya. Although, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>û<i>l</i>aka, I have said that he who is in need of grass may seek for grass, and he who is in need of wood may seek for wood, and he who is in need of a conveyance may seek for a conveyance, and he who is in need of a servant may seek for a servant; yet have I never said in any way whatever that gold or silver may be sought after or accepted."</p>  
 <p>'It is for maintaining this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; that what is against the Vinaya is against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya is Vinaya.'</p>  
 <p>5. 'And once, Sirs, the Blessed One at the same place, at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, on the occasion of the matter of Upananda, the Sâkyan, distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'It is for maintaining this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 393</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; that what is against the Vinaya is against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya is Vinaya.'</p>  
 <p>6. When he had thus spoken, the lay brethren said to Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka There is but one, Sirs <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who is a Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>a, our master, Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka. All the rest are no Sama<i>n</i>as, neither Sakyaputtiyas. Let the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, dwell among us. We will exert ourselves to provide him with robes, and food, and medicine, and the necessaries for the sick.'</p>  
 <p>Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, having gained over the lay brethren, returned with the companion Bhikkhu to the Ârâma,</p>  
 <p>7. And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî asked the companion Bhikkhu: 'Did Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, obtain, Sir, the forgiveness of the lay brethren?'</p>  
 <p>'Evil, Sirs, hath been wrought against us. Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, and he alone has been decided to be a Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>a, and all of us neither Sama<i>n</i>as nor Sakyaputtiyas.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî said: 'The venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, without being deputed by us, has proclaimed to laymen (a false doctrine) <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Come, let us carry out the Act of Suspension <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">3</font></a> against him.' And</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_394"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 394</font></a></p>  
 <p>they assembled together with the intention of doing so.</p>  
 <p>But the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, rose up into the sky and descended at Kosambî. And he sent messengers to the Bhikkhus of the Western country, and of Avanti, and of the Southern country <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">1</font></a>, saying, 'Let your reverences come! We must take in charge this legal question before what is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and what is Dhamma is put aside; before what is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and what is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>  
 <p>8. Now at that time the venerable Sambhûta Sâ<i>n</i>avâsî <a name="fr_1009"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">2</font></a> was dwelling on the Ahogaṅga Hill <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And thither the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, went; and on his arrival he saluted the venerable Sambhûta Sâ<i>n</i>avâsî, and took his seat on one side: and being so seated he said to him:</p>  
 <p>'Lord, these Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî have</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 395</font></a></p>  
 <p>put forward ten theses.' And he told him what they were <a name="fr_1011"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and added: 'Come now, Lord, let us take in charge this last question before what is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and what is Dhamma is put aside; before what is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and what is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>  
 <p>'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Sambhûta Sâ<i>n</i>avâsî, in assent to the venerable Yasa Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-putta.</p>  
 <p>Then about sixty Bhikkhus from the Western country, all of whom were hermits, all of whom lived only on alms, all of whom dressed only in cast-off clothes, and kept only three robes, and all of whom were Arahats, assembled together at the Ahogaṅga Hill. And about eighty-eight from Avanti and the Southern country, some of whom were hermits, and some of whom, lived only on alms, and some of whom dressed only in cast-off clothes, and some of whom kept only three robes, but all of whom were Arahats, met together with them on the Ahogaṅga Hill.</p>  
 <p>9. And the Thera Bhikkhus, consulting together, came to this conclusion: 'This legal question, now, is hard and subtle. How can we obtain such support that we may have the greater power at the decision thereof <a name="fr_1012"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">2</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 396</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the venerable Revata was dwelling at Soreyya, and he was wise in the traditions, one who had learned the Agamas (the four Nikâyas), and knew by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mâtikâs; intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, devoted to the precepts <a name="fr_1013"></a><a href="#fn_995"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And the Thera Bhikkhus thought that if they could gain him over to their side, they would attain their end.</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Revata, by the divine ear, clear and surpassing that of men, heard the Thera Bhikkhus as they were thus consulting together; and he thought: 'This legal question is both hard and subtle, it would not become me to hold back therefrom. But even now those Bhikkhus (the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ians) will be coming. It would be unpleasant travelling for me were I to fall in with them. Let me go on before them.'</p>  
 <p>So the venerable Revata went from Soreyya to Sa<i>m</i>kassa. And when the Thera Bhikkhus went to Soreyya, and asked: 'Where is the venerable Revata?' they said: 'He is gone to Sa<i>m</i>kassa.'</p>  
 <p>Now the venerable Revata had gone on from Sa<i>m</i>kassa to Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>aku<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. And when the Thera Bhikkhus came to Sa<i>m</i>kassa, and asked: 'Where is the venerable Revata?' they said: 'He is gone on to Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>aku<i>g</i><i>g</i>a.' And in the same way they followed him thither, and to Udumbara, and to Aggalapura, and to Saha<i>g</i>âti, and there they met with the venerable Revata.</p>  
 <p>10. And the venerable Sambhûta Sâ<i>n</i>avâsî said to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 397</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Friend, the brother Revata is wise in the traditions, has learnt the Agamas, knows by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mâtikâs, he is intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, and devoted to the precepts. If we ask the venerable Revata a puzzling question, he is capable of spending the whole night on that one question. And even now the venerable Revata will call upon a Bhikkhu who is an intoner <a name="fr_1014"></a><a href="#fn_996"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and a pupil of his. Do you, therefore, when the Bhikkhu has concluded, go to the venerable Revata and ask him concerning these ten theses (points).'</p>  
 <p>'Even so, Sir,' said the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, in assent to the venerable Sambhûta Sâ<i>n</i>avâsî.</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Revata called upon the Bhikkhu, the pupil of his, the intoner. And when the Bhikkhu had concluded, the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, went to the venerable Revata, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And, so seated, he said to the venerable Revata <a name="fr_1015"></a><a href="#fn_997"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>  
 <p>'Is the horn-salt-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this horn-salt-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to carry about salt in a horn with the intention of putting it into food which has not been salted?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is the two-inch-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this two-inch-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to eat the midday meal</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 398</font></a></p>  
 <p>beyond the right time, provided only that the shadow has not yet turned two inches?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is the village-trip-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this village-trip-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, for one who has once finished his meal, and refused any more, to eat food which has not been left over, on the ground that he is about to proceed into the village?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is the circuit-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this circuit-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, for a number of Bhikkhus who dwell within the same circuit, within the same boundary, to hold separate Uposathas?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is the indemnity-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this indemnity-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, for a Sa<i>m</i>gha, which is not legally constituted <a name="fr_1016"></a><a href="#fn_998"><font size="1">1</font></a>, to perform an official act on the ground that they will afterwards obtain the sanction of such Bhikkhus who may subsequently arrive?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is the precedent-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this precedent-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to do a thing on the ground that, "My preceptor (upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âya) has practised this; or my teacher (â<i>k</i>ariya) has practised that?"'</p>  
 <p>'In some cases, Sir, this is allowable, and in some not <a name="fr_1017"></a><a href="#fn_999"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 399</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Is the churn-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this churn-license?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, for one who has once finished his meal, and has refused any more, to drink milk not left over from the meal, on the ground that it has left the condition of milk, and has not yet reached the condition of curds <a name="fr_1018"></a><a href="#fn_1000"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to drink toddy?'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sir, is this toddy?'</p>  
 <p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to drink spirits which have left the condition of not being spirits, and yet have not acquired intoxicating properties <a name="fr_1019"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">2</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'Is a rug or mat (when it is beyond the prescribed size) lawful, Lord, because it is unfringed?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>'Is gold and silver, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
 <p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
 <p>These are the ten theses, Lord, which these Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesâlî have put forth. Come, Lord, let us take this legal question in hand before that which is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and that which is Dhamma is put aside; before that which is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and that which is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those</p>

 <p>who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>  
 <p>'Even so, Sir,' said the venerable Revata, in assent to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kâka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka.</p>
