 <p>1. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, on being hindered by the senior Bhikkhus in (their use of) the hot bath-room, out of spite piled up a quantity of sticks (in the fireplace), set fire to them, closed up the doorway, and sat down in the door-way. The Bhikkhus, scorched by the heat, and not being allowed a way out, fell down in a faint.</p>  
 <p>The sober Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. . . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c. . . . . He said to the Bhikkhus,</p>

 <p>2. 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for the Bhikkhus, in respect of the hot bath-room <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">1</font></a>, according to which they ought to behave themselves therein.</p>  
 <p>'Whosoever first enters the bath-room, if ashes have accumulated (in the fireplace) should throw the ashes out. If the hot bath-room, or its prepared flooring, or the cell, or the ante-chamber of the bath, or the cooling-room, or the hall are dirty, they should be swept. The chunam should be pounded, the clay moistened with water, and water poured into the water jar.</p>  
 <p>'When entering the hot bath-room, the face should be smeared over with clay, and the person well covered up in front and behind before entering. A seat is not to be taken so as to hustle the senior Bhikkhus, and junior Bhikkhus are not to be ousted from their seats. If possible, shampooing is to be performed for the senior Bhikkhus in the hot bath-room.</p>  
 <p>'When leaving the hot bath-room, the chair (that has been used to sit on before the fire) should be carried off, and the person well covered up before and behind before leaving. If possible, shampooing is to be performed for the senior Bhikkhus in the water also.</p>  
 <p>'A bath is not to be taken in front of the senior Bhikkhus, nor above them. One who has bathed</p>

 <p>and is getting up out (of the water) is to make ay for one who is getting down into the water.</p>  
 <p>'Whoso comes last out of the hot bath-room is to wash it, if it be dirty; to wash the vessel in which the clay is kept, to put the chairs used in the hot bath-room in order, to extinguish the fire, to close up the doorway, and then come out.</p>  
 <p>'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct which I lay down for the Bhikkhus, in respect of the hot bath-room, according to which they are to behave themselves therein.'</p>
