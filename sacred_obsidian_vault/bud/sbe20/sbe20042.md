 <p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu went on his round for alms with long finger-nails. A certain woman, seeing him, said to that Bhikkhu: 'Come along, Sir, and have connection with me.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, Sister, that is not becoming.'</p>  
 <p>'If you do not, Sir, I will at once scratch <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">1</font></a> my limbs with my own nails, and will make as if I were angry, saying, "This Bhikkhu has ill-treated me."'</p>  
 <p>'Settle that with yourself, Sister.'</p>  
 <p>That woman did as she had said, and people running up seized that Bhikkhu. Then they saw skin and blood on the woman's nails; and on seeing that, they let the Bhikkhu go, saying, 'This is the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>  
 <p>work of the woman herself. The Bhikkhu has not done it.'</p>  
 <p>Then that Bhikkhu, returning to the Ârâma, told the matter to the Bhikkhus.</p>  
 <p>'What then, Sir, do you wear long nails?'</p>  
 <p>'It is even so, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured (&amp;c. . . . .) told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long nails. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhus tore off their nails with the nails, bit them off with their teeth, or rubbed them down against the wall; and their fingers were hurt.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, nail-cutters.'</p>  
 <p>They cut their nails down to the blood, and their fingers were hurt.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cut your nails according to the length of the flesh.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had all the twenty nails (on their hands and feet) polished.</p>  
 <p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like those who still live in the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the twenty nails polished. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to remove the dirt only.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time the Bhikkhus' hair grew long.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Are the Bhikkhus able, O Bhikkhus, to remove one another's hair?'</p>  
 <p>'They are, Lord.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, after he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of razors, of a hone to sharpen the razors on, of powder prepared with Sipâ<i>t</i>ika-gum to prevent them rusting <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of a sheath to hold them in <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of all the apparatus of a barber <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>4. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus wore (&amp;c., as usual, down to)</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your beards cut (by barbers) <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">4</font></a>, nor to let them grow long, nor to wear them long on the chin like a goat's beard <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">5</font></a>, nor so cut that they have four corners <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">6</font></a>, nor to cut off the hair growing on your breast <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">7</font></a>, nor to cut the hair on your bellies into figures <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">8</font></a>, nor to wear whiskers <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">9</font></a>, nor to remove the hair from your private parts <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">10</font></a>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>

 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a fistula <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the ointment would not stick to it.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to remove the hair from the private parts.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to)</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your hair cut off with a knife <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore on his head, and the hair could not be removed with a razor.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to have your hair cut off with a knife.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus wore the hair in their nostrils long.</p>  
 <p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like the devil-worshippers  <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear the hair in your nostrils long. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus had the hair in their nostrils pulled out with a potsherd <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or with. beeswax; and their nostrils were hurt.</p>

 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of pincers <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="sbe20043.htm#fn_360"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c.; as before, ending with)</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the white hairs pulled out (off your heads). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu's ears were stopped with the wax.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of an instrument to remove the wax from the ear <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="sbe20043.htm#fn_361"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>
