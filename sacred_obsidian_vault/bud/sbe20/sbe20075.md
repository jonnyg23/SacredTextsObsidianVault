 <p align="justify'">1. Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Anupiyâ as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Kosambî. And journeying straight on he arrived in due course at Kosambî, and there, at Kosambî, he stayed at the Ghosita Ârâma. Now the following thought occurred to Devadatta when he had retired into solitude, and was plunged in meditation: 'Whom now <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">1</font></a> can I so gain over that, he being well pleased with me, much gain and honour may result to me? And it occurred to him, 'Now this prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu is young, and has a lucky future before him. Let me then gain him over; and he being well pleased with me, much gain and honour will result.'</p>  
 <p>Then Devadatta folded up his sleeping-mat, and set out, fully bowled and robed, for Râ<i>g</i>agaha; and in due course he arrived at Râ<i>g</i>agaha. Then he laid aside his own form, and took upon himself the form of a child clad in a girdle of snakes, and appeared on the lap of prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234</font></a></p>  
 <p>prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu terrified, and startled, and anxious, and alarmed.</p>  
 <p>And Devadatta said to prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu, 'Are you afraid of me, O prince?'</p>  
 <p>'Yes, I am. Who are you?'</p>  
 <p>'I am Devadatta.'</p>  
 <p>'If you, Sir, are really the worthy Devadatta, be good enough to appear in your own shape.'</p>  
 <p>Then Devadatta, laying aside the form of the child, appeared there before prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu with his inner and outer robes on, and with his bowl in his hand. And prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu was well pleased with Devadatta by reason of this marvel of Iddhi, and morning and evening he used to go in five hundred chariots to wait upon him, and food was brought and laid before him in five hundred dishes.</p>  
 <p>Then there arose in Devadatta's mind, possessed and vanquished by gain and hospitality and fame <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">1</font></a>, some such thought as this: 'It is I who ought to lead the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha.' And as the idea rose up within him, (that moment) was Devadatta deprived of that his power of Iddhi.</p>  
 <p>2. Nov at that time a Koliyan, by name Kakudha, who had been (as Bhikkhu) the attendant on Moggallâna, had just died, and had appeared again in a certain spiritual body <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">2</font></a>, possessed of a personality as large as two or three of the common rice-fields of a Mâgadha village, and yet so constituted <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">3</font></a> that he was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p>not in the way either of himself or of others <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And this celestial being, Kakudha, went to the venerable Moggallâna, and bowed down before him, and took his stand on one side. And so standing, he told the venerable Moggallâna [of the thought that had arisen in Devadatta's mind, and of the result thereof]. And when he had told him, he bowed down before the venerable Moggallâna, and keeping him on his right side as he passed him, he vanished away.</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Moggallâna went to the place where the Blessed One was, and told him [the whole matter] <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'What then, Moggallâna, have you so penetrated the mind of that celestial being Kakudha, that you know that whatsoever he speaks, that will be accordingly, and not otherwise <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">3</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'I have, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>'Keep that saying, Moggallâna, secret; keep that saying secret. Even now that foolish man will himself make himself known.</p>  
 <p>3 <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 'There are, Moggallâna, these five kinds of teachers now existing in the world. What are the five?</p>  
 <p>'In the first place, Moggallâna, there is one kind of teacher whose conduct not being pure, he yet</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>  
 <p>gives out that he is a person of pure conduct, one whose conduct is pure, and innocent, and without stain. His disciples know that that is so, but they think, "If we announce the fact to the laity, he will not like it. And how can we conduct ourselves towards him in a way that is displeasing to him? And besides he is honoured with gifts of the requisite clothing, food, lodging, and medicine for the sick. He will sooner or later become known by that which he himself will do." Such a teacher, Moggallâna, do his disciples protect in respect of his own conduct. And being as he is, he expects <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">1</font></a> to be protected by his disciples in respect of his own conduct.</p>  
 <p>4. 'Again, Moggallâna,' &amp;c. [as before, putting successively 'mode of livelihood,' 'preaching of the Dhamma,' 'system of exposition,' &amp;c., 'insight arising from knowledge,' 'for 'conduct']. 'These, Moggallâna, are the five kinds of teachers now existing in the world. But I being pure in conduct, mode of livelihood, preaching of the Dhamma, system of exposition, and insight arising from knowledge, give out that I am so, that I am pure, innocent, and without stain in all these things. And neither do my disciples protect me in respect of my own conduct, nor do I expect them to do so.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Kosambî as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Râ<i>g</i>agaha. And journeying straight on, he arrived in due course at Râ<i>g</i>agaha; and there, at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, he stayed at the Ve<i>l</i>uvana in the Kalandaka Nivâpa.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a></p>  
 <p>And a number of Bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and bowed down before him, and took their seats on one side., And when so seated, they said to the Blessed One: 'Prince A<i>g</i>âtasattu is in the habit of going morning and evening with five hundred carts to wait upon Devadatta, and food is brought and laid before him in five hundred dishes.'</p>  
 <p>'Envy not, O Bhikkhus, the gain and hospitality and fame of Devadatta. So long, O Bhikkhus, as A<i>g</i>âtasattu [so waits upon him and gives him alms] so long may we expect Devadatta not to prosper, but to decline in virtuous qualities <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Just, O Bhikkhus, as if you were to burst a gall (bladder) <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">2</font></a> before the nose of a fierce dog, the dog would thereby become so much the fiercer, just so long, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before). To his own hurt, O Bhikkhus, has this gain, hospitality, and fame come to Devadatta, to his own destruction. Just, O Bhikkhus, as a plantain, or a bamboo, or a reed gives fruit to its own hurt and its own destruction <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">3</font></a>, just so to his own hurt (&amp;c., as before). Just as a young she-mule conceives to her own hurt and her own destruction <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">4</font></a>, just so, O Bhikkhus, to his own hurt has this gain, &amp;c., come to Devadatta.</p>  
 <p>'Its fruit destroys the plantain-tree; its fruit the bamboo and the reed.</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Honour destroys the evil man, just as its foal destroys the young she-mule.'</p>
