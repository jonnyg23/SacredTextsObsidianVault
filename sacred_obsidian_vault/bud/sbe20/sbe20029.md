 <p>1. Now at that time at Vesâlî a regular service of sweet food had been established, the laity taking the duty in turns. The Bhikkhus, eating the sweet food, became very sick with superfluity of humors in their body <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p>prescribe, O Bhikkhus, the use of the cloister and of the bath-room.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhus walked up and down on a cloister on uneven ground; and their feet were hurt.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it level.'</p>  
 <p>The cloister had too low a basement, and was inundated with water <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it with a high basement.'</p>  
 <p>The facing of the basement fell in <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of facing of three kinds--brick facing, stone facing, and wooden facing.'</p>  
 <p>They found difficulty in getting up into it.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of stairs of three kinds--brick stairs, stone stairs, and wooden stairs.'</p>  
 <p>As they were going up them, they fell off.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a balustrade.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when walking up and down in the cloister, fell down.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to provide a railing <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">3</font></a> for the cloister.'</p>

 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when walking up and down in the open air, were distressed by heat and by cold.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a hall for the cloister <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">1</font></a>,'</p>  
 <p>Straw and plaster fell (from the walls and roof) into the cloister-hall.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to first cover over (the walls and roof with skins), and then plaster them. (And I allow the use of) whitewash, and blacking, and red colouring, and wreath-work, and creeper-work, and bone hooks, and cupboards, and bamboos to hang robes on, and strings to hang robes on.'</p>  
 <p>3. [The whole of the above, from the basement down to the balustrade, is repeated of the hot-bath house.]</p>  
 <p>The bath house had no door.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a door, with door-posts and lintel <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with hollows like a mortar (for the door to revolve in <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">3</font></a>), with projections to</p>

 <p>The lower part of the wattle and daub wall <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the bath-room decayed (through damp).</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to face round the lower half of the wall (with bricks <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">2</font></a>).'</p>  
 <p>The bath-room had no chimney <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a chimney.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus made a fire-place in the middle of a small bath-room, and there was no room to get to (the bath).</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make the fire-place at one side of a small bath-room, and in the middle of a large one <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>The fire in the bath-room scorched their faces.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of clay to spread over your faces <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>They moistened the clay in their hands.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a trough to moisten the clay in <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">6</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>The clay had a bad smell.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to scent it.'</p>  
 <p>The fire in the bath-room scorched their bodies.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have water poured over you.'</p>  
 <p>They poured the water out of dishes and alms-bowls.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a stand for the water, and saucers <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a> to pour it from.'</p>  
 <p>A bath-room with a thatched roof did not produce perspiration.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover the roof of the bath-room (with skins <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a>), and to plaster it within and without.'</p>  
 <p>The bath-room became swampy.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to lay the floor with flooring of three kinds--brick flooring, stone flooring, and wooden flooring.'</p>  
 <p>It still became swampy.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wash the floor.'</p>  
 <p>The water settled on the floor.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a drain to carry off the water <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus sat in the bath-room on the ground, and they had pins and needles in their limbs <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p>Now at that time the bath-room had no enclosure.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to enclose it with three kinds of enclosures--brick walls, and stone walls, and wooden fences.'</p>  
 <p>4. There was no antechamber <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">1</font></a> (in which the water could be kept).</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have an antechamber.'</p>  
 <p>The basement of the antechamber was too low, and it was inundated with water [and so on, as in II. 6, and in the last section down to the end of the description of the door, followed by the closing words of II. 6 and of § 2 from 'straw and plaster fell, &amp;c.,' down to 'cupboards <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">2</font></a>'].</p>

 <p>some business or other. And on seeing the Bhikkhus very sick with superfluity of humors, he went up to where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there, he saluted the Blessed One and took his seat on one side. And when so seated he said to the Blessed One: 'The Bhikkhus, Lord are now very sick with superfluity of humors. It would be well if the Blessed One were to prescribe, Lord for the Bhikkhus the use of the cloister <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">1</font></a> and of the bath-room <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thus will the Bhikkhus become convalescent.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One instructed, and aroused, and incited, and gladdened <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a with religious discourse. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a; so instructed, and incited, and aroused, and gladdened with religious discourse, arose from his seat and saluted the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, departed thence. And the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'I</p>

It was not ordinarily used for cold baths, which were taken in the rivers or tanks, but for a kind of hot-water bath, or perhaps steam bath, the exact mode of taking or administering which is not as yet certain. Several Bhikkhus took the bath at the same time, but it is not likely that they got into the water (though the expression uttarati is used, loc. cit., of their leaving the bath), as they scarcely would have made vessels large enough to contain a man. It rather seems that they sat on stools close to a large fire, and had water poured over them. The use of this kind of bath is forbidden to the Bhikkhunîs at <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 27, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="sbe20029.htm#fr_255">104:1</a> All the following paragraphs are the same as above, V, 11, 6, where see our notes.</p>

Buddhaghosa has nothing on them, either here or there; and they were probably therefore in quite common use even in his day. The whole of this paragraph recurs below, VI, 3, 7.</p>

As the principal bolt was probably called aggala (unless that were the name for the whole machinery), this was some smaller bolt. And in <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, I an instance is given of a man undoing the bolt (gha<i>t</i>ikam ugghâ<i>t</i>etvâ) of an uninhabited vihâra, such as is referred to in VI, 2, I.</p>

Âvi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>i (or âvi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>i?) at Sutta-vibhaṅga, Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa II, 4, 9, means he drew towards himself; and Âvi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>anâ (âvi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anâ?), ibid.
