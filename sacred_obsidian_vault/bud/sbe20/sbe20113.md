 <p>1. Now at that time a courtesan named A<i>d</i><i>dh</i>akâsî <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">3</font></a> had adopted the religious life under the Bhikkhunîs, and she wanted to go to Sâvatthi to be received as full member of the Order (to receive the upasampadâ initiation) by the Blessed One himself. And men of abandoned life heard of it, and beset the road. And when A<i>d</i><i>dh</i>akâsî, the courtesan, heard that they had done so, she sent a messenger to the Blessed One, saying: 'I want to receive the upasampadâ initiation: what course of action should I adopt?'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, in that connection, addressed the Bhikkhus, after delivering a religious discourse <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and said: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation (upon Bhikkhunîs) even by a messenger <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. They conferred it by (sending) a Bhikkhu as the messenger.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation on a Bhikkhunî by sending a Bhikkhu as messenger. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>They conferred it by sending a female student . . . . . a male novice . . . . . a female novice . . . . . an ignorant, incompetent Bhikkhunî, as the messenger.</p>  
 <p>[Similar decision in each case.]</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to confer the upasampadâ initiation by sending a learned, competent Bhikkhunî, as a messenger.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'That Bhikkhunî messenger is to go before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and arranging her robe over one shoulder, is to bow down before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and sitting on her heels, to stretch forth her joined palms, and say "N. N., having been desirous of receiving the upasampadâ initiation with the lady, M. M. (as her proposer), has received it on the one hand from the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha, and has there been declared free (from the Disqualifications <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">1</font></a>). But she is prevented by some danger or other from coming before the Sa<i>m</i>gha (to have her initiation confirmed) <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">2</font></a>. N. N. asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for initiation, Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha raise her up (out of the worldly life) out of compassion upon her.' [To be said thrice.]</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Then let a learned, competent Bhikkhu lay the motion before the Sa<i>m</i>gha. "Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., having been desirous . . . . . [statement of fact, as before]. If it seem meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha confer the upasampadâ initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. That is the motion.</p>  
 <p>'"Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, venerable Sirs, hear me. N. N., . . . . [statement of fact, as before]. The Sa<i>m</i>gha hereby confers the upasampadâ initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves thereof, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. And a second time I say the same thing. N. N., . . . . . (&amp;c., down to) let him speak. And a third time I say the same thing. N. N., . . . . . (&amp;c., down to) let him speak.</p>  
 <p>'"The Sa<i>m</i>gha has hereby conferred the upasampadâ initiation upon N. N., M. M. being her proposer. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>  
 <p>'Then, further, let them (the Bhikkhus) measure the shadow, tell (the messenger that she may tell the newly-received Bhikkhunî) what season and what date it is, tell her what part of the day it is, tell her the whole formula; and tell the Bhikkhunîs to teach her what are the three things allowed, and what are the eight things interdicted <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>
