 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sâvatthi, in Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Ârâma.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time incoming Bhikkhus entered the Ârâma with their sandals on <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or with sunshades held up over them <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or with their heads muffled up <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or with their upper robe carried in a bundle on their heads <a name="fr_760"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and they washed their feet in the drinking-water; and they did not salute resident Bhikkhus senior to them, nor ask them where they (the incomers) should sleep.</p>  
 <p>And a certain incoming Bhikkhu undid the bolt <a name="fr_761"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">5</font></a> of an unoccupied room (Vihâra), and opened the door <a name="fr_762"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and so entered by force; and a snake fell</p>

 <p>on to his back from the lintel above <a name="fr_763"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and he was terrified, and made an outcry <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus, running up, asked him why he did so. He told them that matter. Then those Bhikkhus who were moderate in their desires were vexed and indignant, and murmured, saying, 'How can incoming Bhikkhus enter the Ârâma . . . .? (&amp;c., as before, down to) . . . . where they should sleep <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>They told the matter to the Blessed One (&amp;c., as usual, I, 1, 2, 3, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for incoming Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.</p>  
 <p>2. 'An incoming Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, when he knows he is about to enter an Ârâma, ought to take off his sandals, turn them upside down <a name="fr_766"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">4</font></a>, beat them (to get the dust) off, take them (up again) in his</p>

 <p>hand, put down his sunshade, uncover his head, arrange his upper robe on his back <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and then carefully and slowly enter the Ârâma.</p>  
 <p>'When he enters the Ârâma he ought to notice where the resident Bhikkhus are gone to; and whithersoever they are gone--whether to the service hall, or to the portico (ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>apa), or to the foot of a tree--thither he ought to go, and laying his bowl on one side, and his robe on one side, he ought to take a suitable seat, and sit down.</p>  
 <p>'He ought to ask as to the drinking-water, and the water for washing <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">2</font></a>, which is appropriated to the one use, and which to the other. If he has need of drinking-water, he ought to fetch it and drink. If he has need of water for washing, he ought to fetch it, and wash his feet. In washing his feet he ought to pour the water over them with one hand, and wash them with the other; he ought not to pour the water over them and wash them with one and the same hand.</p>  
 <p>'He ought to ask for the cloths with which sandals are cleaned, and clean his sandals. In cleaning his sandals he ought first to wipe them with a dry cloth, and afterwards with a wet cloth: and then he ought to wash the cloths, and lay them on one side <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>'If the resident Bhikkhu be senior, he ought to be saluted; if junior, he ought to be made to salute (the incomer). The incomer ought to ask as to the lodging-place, which has fallen (to his lot) <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and whether it is occupied or unoccupied. He ought to ask as to lawful and unlawful resorts <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and as to what families have been officially declared to be in want <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p> <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">4</font></a>'He ought to ask as to the retiring-places, (where they are), and as to the drinking-water, and as to the water for washing, and as to the staves for walking with, and as to the place for the conferences of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, (and as to) the time at which he ought to enter (it) and at which he ought to leave it.</p>  
 <p>3. 'If the Vihâra be unoccupied, he ought to knock at the door, then to wait a minute, then to undo the bolt, and open the door, and then, still standing outside, to look within.</p>  
 <p>'If that Vihâra is covered with dust <a name="fr_774"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">5</font></a>, or the beds or chairs are piled one upon another, and the bedding put in a heap on the top of them <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_761"><font size="1">6</font></a>,--then if</p>

 <p>he can do so he ought to clean up the Vihâra. <a name="fr_776"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">1</font></a> And when cleaning the Vihâra, he ought to take the floor matting out and put it down on one side, and the supports of the bedsteads <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the bolsters <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">3</font></a> and pillows, and the mat which is used as a seat. Putting the bedsteads and chairs down on to the ground, and carefully avoiding scratching (the floor with them) or knocking them up against (the door-posts), he ought to take them outside the door, and put them down on one side. The spittoon and the board to lean up against <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_765"><font size="1">4</font></a> ought to be taken out, and put down on one side <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_766"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'If the Vihâra is covered with cobwebs, they should first be removed with a cloth <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">6</font></a>. The casements should be dusted, especially in the corners and joints.</p>  
 <p>'If the wall which had been plastered and red-washed, or the floor which had been laid (with earth) and black-washed <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">7</font></a>, has become dirty in the corners <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">8</font></a>, they should be wiped down with a</p>

 <p><a name="fn_772"></a><a href="sbe20079.htm#fr_786">277:3</a> Ûha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>i. So also at Mahâvagga I, 25, 15. At Mahâvagga I, 49, 4, we should have rendered 'defiled their beds' instead of 'threw their bedding about,' correcting uhananti of the text there into ûhadanti. Ûhan (originally 'to throw up,' 'raise,' &amp;c.) seems, like samûhan, to have acquired the meaning of to destroy, injure, spoil. From this meaning of spoiling, ûhan evidently came to be used for, or confounded in the MS. with, ûhad, 'to defile (with excrement).' So the phrase 'ûhananti pi ummihanti pi' (at Mahâvagga I, 49, 4) exactly corresponds in meaning to 'omuttenti pi ûhadayanti pi' in Dhammapada, p. 283. There are other passages showing the same confusion. (1) The gerund, ûha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, which occurs in <i>G</i>âtaka II, p. 71 ('idâni kho (ahan) ta<i>m</i> ûha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a'), is explained by the commentator to mean 'va<i>k</i><i>k</i>an te sîse katva.' (2) ûhanti, in Gâtaka II, p. 73 ('aggihutta<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a ûhanti, tena bhinnâ kama<i>n</i><i>d</i>alûti'), must mean the same and be = ûhadeti. For the monkey here referred to is said to have been guilty of the following dirty trick:--'ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ bhindati, aggisâlâya va<i>k</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i> karoti.' (3) mutteti ohaneti at <i>K</i>ariyâ Pi<i>t</i>aka II, 5, 4, represents u<i>k</i><i>k</i>âra-pasâvam katvâ at <i>G</i>âtaka II, 385. In the first of these passages uha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a may well be a copyist's blunder, arising from the similarity of the words, for uha<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. Dr. Morris, to whom we owe the comparison of these passages and the suggested emendation of Mahâvagga I, 49, 4, is rather of opinion that the words were confounded by the writers. For it is not an uncommon thing to find two words, not very remote in form or meaning, confounded together. It is well known that the English word livelihood properly and originally meant 'liveliness,' and has only afterwards replaced the earlier livelode, to which the sense of livelihood properly belongs. And something of this kind <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a> must have occurred, he thinks„in Pâli in the use of ûhan for it had. The past participle ûhata occurs at <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 10, 3.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_775"></a><a href="sbe20079.htm#fr_789">278:3</a> This passage throws a welcome light on the meaning of ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a and pî<i>th</i>a: for as they were to be beaten to get the dust out, it is clear that they were upholstered. The ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a, or bed, must have been a wooden framework, stuffed (probably with cotton), covered at the top with cotton cloth, and made underneath and at the sides of wood. It had no legs fixed to it, but was supported on movable tressels--the pa<i>t</i>ipâdakâ. When using it, the sleeper covered it with a mat, or a cotton sheet, and had over him a coverlet of some kind; and these articles, which he would also use if he slept on the ground, constituted, together with the bolster and pillows, the senâsana<i>m</i> or bedding,--that is, in the more special and limited use of that term (as, for instance, above, § 3, and perhaps below, 7, 1).
