 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One spake in many a figure concerning the Vinaya, speaking in praise of the Vinaya, in praise of learning the Vinaya, and again and again in reference thereto in praise of the venerable Upâli. Then said the Bhikkhus: 'The Blessed One speaks (&amp;c., down to) Upâli. Come, let us learn the Vinaya under the venerable Upâli.' And many Bhikkhus, senior and junior, and of medium standing, went to learn the Vinaya under the venerable Upâli. The venerable Upâli taught them standing, out of reverence for the senior Bhikkhus, and the senior Bhikkhus heard him standing, out of reverence for the law; and thereby both the senior Bhikkhus grew weary, and the venerable Upâli.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a junior Bhikkhu, when giving instruction, to sit on a seat of equal height, or higher, out of reverence for the law; and a senior Bhikkhu, when receiving instruction, to sit on a seat</p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>of equal height, or lower, out of reverence for the law <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time a. number of Bhikkhus stood around Upâli, waiting for seats <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and they grew weary.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit down together with brethren entitled to sit on seats of equal height.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'How many of us are entitled to sit on seats of equal height?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit on the same seat with those who are within three years of one another in seniority.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus, entitled to sit on the same seat, sat down on a couch, and broke the couch down; or sat down on a chair, and broke the chair down.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a couch, or a chair, for three persons.'</p>  
 <p>Even when three sat on the couch, or chair, it broke.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, two to sit on a couch or a chair.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time Bhikkhus who were not entitled to seats of equal height, were afraid they would offend if they sat together on a long seat. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sit together on a long seat with others not entitled to sit on seats of equal height, unless they are women, or eunuchs, or hermaphrodites.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'What is the limit of length which is included under the term "long seat?"'</p>  
 <p>'I allow the term "long seat" to be used, O Bhikkhus, of any seat long enough to accommodate three persons.</p>
