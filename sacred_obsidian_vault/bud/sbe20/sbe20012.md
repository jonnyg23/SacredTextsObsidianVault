 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">5</font></a>, being examined in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha with an offence, when he had denied then confessed it, when he had confessed it then denied it, made</p>

 <p>counter-charges <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and spoke lies which he knew to be such <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a do so?' And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say that the Bhikkhu [&amp;c., as before].'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Then he rebuked him, and when he had delivered a religious discourse he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha carry out the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma (the Proceeding in the case of the obstinately wrong) <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be carried out. In the first place the Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a must have been warned; when he had been warned, he must have been called upon to remember (whether he has, or has not, consciously committed the offence); when he had been called upon to remember, he must have been caused (by being put on his trial with respect to the offence) to bring upon himself a new</p>

 <p>offence (namely, of obstinacy or prevarication); when he has brought upon himself this new offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear the. This Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a, being examined in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha with an offence, when he has denied it then confesses it, when he has confessed it then denies it, makes counter-charges, and speaks lies which he knows to be such. If the time seems meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha carry out the Tassapâpiyyasikâ-kamma against the Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a.</p>  
 <p>'"This is the motion.</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. This Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a (&amp;c., as before). The Sa<i>m</i>gha carries out the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma against Uvâ<i>l</i>a the Bhikkhu. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma being carried out against Uvâ<i>l</i>a the Bhikkhu, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.</p>  
 <p>'"A second time I say the same thing. This Bhikkhu Uvâ<i>l</i>a (&amp;c., as before, down to) let him speak. A third time I say the same thing (&amp;c., as before, down to) let him speak.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="sbe20012.htm#fr_54">27:5</a> In the Burmese MSS. the name of this monk is written Upavâla.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_55"></a><a href="sbe20012.htm#fr_56">28:2</a> Chapter 14, section 29 below, is in fact an elaboration of this paragraph, giving instances of the kind of prevarication here intended to be referred to.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_56"></a><a href="sbe20012.htm#fr_57">28:3</a> The exact meaning of the phrase is somewhat doubtful, owing to the ambiguity of the tassa. It should probably be analysed 'the proceeding against one who is more sinful (pâpiyo) than that (tassa);' that is, who adds sin to sin. Childers gives a long note on the Proceeding drawn by Wijesi<i>m</i>ha Mudaliyar from this chapter, but does not analyse the word.</p>
