 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Â<i>l</i>avî as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Râ<i>g</i>agaha. And proceeding straight on, he arrived in due course at Râ<i>g</i>agaha. And there, at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, the Blessed One stayed at the Ve<i>l</i>uvana in the Kalandaka Nivâpa.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time there was a scarcity of food at Râ<i>g</i>agaha <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The people were unable to provide food for the (whole) Sa<i>m</i>gha and they were desirous of providing food <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">2</font></a> (to be sent to the Vihâra) for the use of a special Bhikkhu (designated by the donor) <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">3</font></a> or for special Bhikkhus invited (by the donor in his own house) <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">4</font></a> or for (single Bhikkhus) appointed by ticket (issued by the Sa<i>m</i>gha) <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">5</font></a>, or of providing food during a fortnight <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">6</font></a>, or on Uposatha</p>  
 <p>

 <p>days (that is, on the last days of each fortnight) or on the first days of each fortnight.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, each of three ways of obtaining food.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus having received good food for themselves, gave over the worse food (which they had also received) to the other Bhikkhus.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as apportioner of rations <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">1</font></a> a Bhikkhu who is possessed of the following five qualifications--(&amp;c., as in IV, 9, down to the end of the Kammavâ<i>k</i>â):</p>  
 <p>Now the Bhikkhus who were apportioners of rations, thought: 'How then are the rations to be apportioned?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you. O Bhikkhus, to apportion them by arranging the food in small heaps, and fastening tickets or marks upon them <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Sa<i>m</i>gha had no distributor</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>of lodging-places--no overseer of stores--no receiver of robes--no distributor of robes, of congey, or of fruits--and no distributor of dry foods, and through not being distributed it went bad.</p>  
 <p>They told each of these matters <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as distributor of lodging-places, &amp;c., a Bhikkhu who has (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to the end of the Kammavâ<i>k</i>â, inserting throughout the appropriate variations in the fifth qualification).</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time articles of trifling value had accumulated in the storehouse of the Sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as disposer of trifles a Bhikkhu who has (&amp;c., as before, down to the end of the Kammavâ<i>k</i>â). Each separate needle, and pair of scissors, and pair of sandals, and girdle, and pair of braces, and filtering cloth, and regulation strainer <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and plait <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and half-plait <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and gusset <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and half-gusset <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and binding <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and braiding <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">4</font></a>, is to be given away. If the Sa<i>m</i>gha has any ghee, or oil, or honey, or molasses, he is to give it away for personal consumption only, and if it be wanted, he is to give it a second and a third time <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>Now at that time the Sa<i>m</i>gha had no receiver of under-garments <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or of bowls,--no superintendent of those who kept the grounds in order (the Ârâmikas), and the Ârâmikas not being looked after, the necessary work was not done,--no superintendent of sâma<i>n</i>eras, and the sâma<i>n</i>eras not being looked after did not perform their duties.</p>  
 <p>They told each of these matters to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as receiver of under-garments, &amp;c., a Bhikkhu who has (&amp;c., as before, down to the end of the Kammavâ<i>k</i>â).'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_619"></a><a href="sbe20073.htm#fr_629">220:1</a> Other special rules for times of scarcity will be found at Mahâvagga VI, 17, 7; 18, 4; 19, 2; 20, 4 (repealed for times of plenty in VI, 32). Compare also Pârâ<i>g</i>ika IV, 1, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_620"></a><a href="sbe20073.htm#fr_630">220:2</a> The above modes of receiving food (instead of collecting in a bowl morsels of food given in alms) are the dispensations allowed by Mahâvagga I, 30, 4.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_622"></a><a href="sbe20073.htm#fr_632">220:4</a> Nimantana<i>m</i> kâtu<i>m</i>. The word is only used in this special technical sense. Compare the whole story of <i>K</i>ulla-panthaka at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 116, and especially the last line.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_623"></a><a href="sbe20073.htm#fr_633">220:5</a> Salâka-bhatta<i>m</i> <i>k</i>âtu<i>m</i>. See especially above, <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 9; IV, to.</p>

Both Childers sub voce and Frankfurter <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a> ('Pali Handbook,' p. 165), in interpreting the passage at Mahâvagga I, 30, 4, take this to mean a feast given on the eighth day of the month. But paksha is the half-month. The expression much more probably means, therefore, to provide food either during the whole of a half-month for one or more specially invited Bhikkhus, or for a larger number on any one day of the half-month to be chosen by the Sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>

That would be under the charge of the distributor of dry foods (§ 2), as if kept it would go bad. According to VI, 15, 10, none of these five <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a> kinds of medicine were to be kept for a period exceeding seven days, but that was a rule that was not very probable to be strictly followed.</p>
