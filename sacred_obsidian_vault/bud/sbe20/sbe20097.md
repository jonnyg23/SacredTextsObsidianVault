 <p>1. Now at that time the Pâtimokkha was not recited to the Bhikkhunîs.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow the Pâtimokkha, O Bhikkhus, to be recited to the Bhikkhunîs.'</p>  
 <p>Now it occurred to the Bhikkhunîs: 'By whom should the Pâtimokkha be recited to the Bhikkhunîs?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the Pâtimokkha to be recited to Bhikkhunîs by Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time Bhikkhus went to the residence of the Bhikkhunîs and recited the Pâtimokkha to the Bhikkhunîs there. The people murmured, and were indignant, saying: 'There are their wives, there are their mistresses; now will they take pleasure together.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus heard this, and told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Bhikkhus are not, O Bhikkhus, to recite the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Pâtimokkha to the Bhikkhunîs at their residence. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to recite the Pâtimokkha to the Bhikkhunîs.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhunîs did not know how to recite the Pâtimokkha. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhunîs how to recite the Pâtimokkha.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhunîs did not confess the faults (they had committed).</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'A Bhikkhunî, O Bhikkhus, is not to leave a fault unconfessed. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhunîs did not know how to confess their faults. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhunîs how they should confess their faults.'</p>  
 <p>Then it occurred to the Bhikkhus: 'By whom ought the confession of a fault to be received from the Bhikkhunîs?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to receive the confession of a fault from Bhikkhunîs.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time Bhikkhunîs, on seeing a Bhikkhu on the road, or in a street closed at one end, or at the place where four cross-roads met, would place their bowl on the ground, and arranging their robes over one shoulder, would crouch down on their heels, and stretch forth their joined hands, and confess a fault. The people murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying: 'There are their wives, there are their mistresses; they are asking</p>

 <p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhunîs how to receive the confession of a fault.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time disciplinary proceedings (Kammas) were not carried out against Bhikkhunîs. They told that matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow disciplinary proceedings, O Bhikkhus, to be carried out against Bhikkhunîs.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'By whom ought disciplinary proceedings to be carried out against Bhikkhunîs?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to carry out disciplinary proceedings against Bhikkhunîs.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time Bhikkhunîs who had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, on seeing a Bhikkhu on the road, or in a street closed at one end, or at the place where four cross-roads met, would place their bowls on the ground, and arranging their robes over one shoulder, would crouch down on their heels, and stretching out their joined palms would ask for pardon, thinking that that was the proper time for doing so. The people murmured [&amp;c., as before].</p>
