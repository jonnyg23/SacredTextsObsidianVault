 <p>1. Now at that time the householder Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika was the husband of the sister of the Râ<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i. And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder went to Râ<i>g</i>agaha on some business or other. Now at that time the Sa<i>m</i>gha, with the Buddha at its head, had been bidden by the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha for the morrow's meal. And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha gave command to his slaves and work-people, saying, 'So get up at early morn, my men, and cook congey, and cook rice, and prepare curries, and pre-pare delicacies <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a></p>  
 <p>And it occurred to Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, 'Now formerly this householder was wont, when I arrived, to lay aside all other business, and exchange the greetings of courtesy with me; but now he appears excited, and is giving orders to his slaves and work-people. How can it be? Is he taking in marriage, or is he giving in marriage, or has he set a great sacrifice on foot, or has he invited the Mâgadhan Seniya Bimbisâra, together with his retinue, for to-morrow's meal?'</p>  
 <p>2. Now when the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha had given commandment to his slaves and his work-people, he went up to the place where Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder was, and exchanged with him the greetings of courtesy, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated, Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder [told him the thoughts that had passed through his mind].</p>  
 <p>'I am neither taking nor giving in marriage, O householder' (was the reply), 'nor have I invited the Mâgadhan Seniya Bimbisâra to to-morrow's meal. But a great sacrifice I have set on foot, for the Sa<i>m</i>gha, with the Buddha at its head, has been invited for to-morrow's meal at my house.'</p>  
 <p>'Did you, O householder, say "the Buddha?"'</p>  
 <p>'Yes, it was "the Buddha" that I said.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p>[And thrice the same question was put, and the same reply was given.]</p>  
 <p>'Hard is it, O householder, to meet even with the mere expression in the world--the news, that is, of "a Buddha, a Buddha <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">1</font></a>." Would it be possible for us, at this very time, to go and visit that Blessed One, the Arahat, the very Buddha <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">2</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'It is not now, O householder, the proper time to pay a visit to the Blessed One; but early on the morrow you shall go and visit him.'</p>  
 <p>Then Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika, pondering of the visit he was about to pay, lay down to sleep with his thoughts so bent upon the Buddha that thrice in the night he arose, thinking the daylight had appeared.</p>  
 <p>3. And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder went up to the gate leading to the Sîtavana, and celestial beings opened the gate. And as he emerged from the city, the light disappeared and a thick darkness arose, and fear and trembling and consternation sprang up within him, so that a longing came upon him to turn back again from that spot. But Sîvaka the Yakkha, himself the while invisible, caused a sound to be heard, saying:</p>  
 <p>'A hundred elephants, a hundred steeds, a hundred chariots with mules <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>'A hundred thousand virgins with their jewelled earrings on,--</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a></p>  
 <p>'These are not worth, O householder, the sixteenth portion of one single stride.</p>  
 <p>'Go on, go on, O householder! Advance, and not retreat, shall profit thee.'</p>  
 <p>Then the darkness disappeared before Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, and a bright light arose, and the fear and trembling and consternation that had sprung upon within him were appeased.</p>  
 <p>[And a second and a third time the same thing happened, and the same words were heard, and with the same result.]</p>  
 <p>4. And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder arrived at the Sîtavana; and at that time the Blessed One, who had arisen at early dawn, was walking up and down (meditating) in the open air. And the Blessed One saw Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder when he was coming from afar; and the Blessed One left the place where he had been, walking up and down, and sat himself down on the seat put out for him. And when he was so seated, he addressed Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Come hither, Sudatta!'</p>  
 <p>Then Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika, glad and happy at the thought that the Blessed One had addressed him by his name, went up to the place where the Blessed</p>  
 <p>One was, and bowed down before him, falling at his feet, and said:</p>  
 <p>'I trust my lord the Blessed One has slept in peace!'</p>  
 <p>'He ever sleeps in peace, the Arahat who is free <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Who is not touched by lusts, but calm and free from sin <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>'Has broken all the bars (to freedom of the mind) <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">2</font></a>, has quenched the anguish in his heart,</p>  
 <p>'Has fixed peace in his mind, and peaceful, sleeps in peace <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>5 <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Then the Blessed One discoursed to Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder in due order; that is to say, he spake to him of giving, of righteousness, of heaven, of the danger, the vanity, and the defilement of lusts, and of the advantages of renunciation. And when the Blessed One saw that Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had become prepared, softened, unprejudiced, and upraised and believing in heart, then he proclaimed that which is the special doctrine of the Buddhas; that is to say, Suffering, its Origin, its Cessation, and the Path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stain has been washed away will readily take the dye, just even so did Anâtha</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth; (that is to say, the knowledge that) whatsoever has a beginning, in that is inherent also the necessity of dissolution. Thus did Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder see, and master, and understand, and penetrate the Truth; and he overcame uncertainty, and dispelled all doubts, and gained full knowledge, becoming dependent upon no one else for his knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher. And he addressed the Blessed One, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Most excellent, Lord (are the words of thy mouth), most excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms just even so, Lord, has the Truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as my refuge, to the Truth, and to the Order. May the Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as one who, from this day forth as long as life endures. has taken his refuge in him. And may the Blessed One consent to accept at my hand the to-morrow's meal for himself and for his Order of Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, by silence, granted his consent. And when Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder perceived that his request had been granted, he rose from his seat, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, he departed thence.</p>  
 <p>6. Now the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha heard that the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Order of Bhikkhus which has the Buddha at its head had been invited by Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder for the morrow's meal. And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha said to Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder: 'They say, O householder, that you have invited the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, with the Buddha at its head, for the morrow's meal, and, you are but a stranger here. I will provide the means <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">1</font></a>, O householder, for you to provide the Order of Bhikkhus, which has the Buddha at its head, with food.'</p>  
 <p>'It is not necessary, O householder; I have means sufficient for the purpose.'</p>  
 <p>[And the townsman of Râ<i>g</i>agaha <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and Seniya Bimbisâra the Râ<i>g</i>a of Magadha, made the same offer in the same words, and received the same reply.]</p>  
 <p>7. Then Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, when the night was far spent, made ready in the house of the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha sweet food both hard and soft, and had the time announced to the Blessed One, saying, 'The time, Lord, has come; and the meal is ready.'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One, when he had dressed himself in the early morning, went duly bowled and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a></p>  
 <p>robed to the house of the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha, and sat down there on the seat spread out for him, together with the Order of Bhikkhus. And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder offered to the Order of Bhikkhus which had the Buddha at its head the sweet food both hard and soft, waiting upon them with his own hand <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his hands and his bowl, Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika took his seat on one side; and, so seated, he said to the Blessed One: 'May the Blessed One consent to spend the rainy season of Was at Sâvatthi, together with the Order of Bhikkhus.'</p>  
 <p>'The Tathâgatas, O householder, take pleasure in solitude.'</p>  
 <p>'I understand, O Blessed One; I understand, O Happy One' (was the reply) <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, after he had instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder with religious discourse, arose from his seat, and departed thence.</p>  
 <p>8. Now at that time Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had many friends and' large acquaintance, and his word was held of weight <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">3</font></a>. When he had</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>brought the business he had in hand at Râ<i>g</i>agaha to its conclusion, he set out towards Sâvatthi; and on the way he gave orders to people, saying, 'Build dwellings, my good men, and make rest-houses ready, and prepare gifts. A Buddha has appeared in the world, and that Blessed One has been invited by me, and by this road will he come.' And those people [did all even as they were commanded].</p>  
 <p>And when Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had arrived at Sâvatthi, he examined all the region round about it, saying <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">1</font></a>, 'Where now shall I fix the place for the Blessed One to stay in, not too far from the town and not too near, convenient for going and for coming, easily accessible for all who wish to visit him, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to too much noise and alarm, protected from the wind <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">2</font></a>, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life?'</p>  
 <p>9. And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder saw that the garden of <i>G</i>eta the Kumâra had [all these advantages]. And when he saw that, he went to <i>G</i>eta the Kumâra, and said to him, 'Sir, let me have your garden to make an Ârâma on it.'</p>  
 <p>'It is not, Sir, for sale, even for (a sum so great that the pieces of money would be sufficient to cover it if they were) laid side by side.'</p>  
 <p>'I take, Sir, the garden at the price.'</p>  
 <p>'No, O householder, there was no bargain meant <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then they asked the lords of justice whether a bargain of sale had been made or not. And the lords decided thus: 'The Ârâma is taken, Sir, at the price which you fixed.'</p>  
 <p>And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had gold brought down in carts, and covered the <i>G</i>etavana with (pieces) laid side by side <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. Now the gold that he had brought down the first time did not suffice (after the rest of the garden was covered) to cover one small space close by the gateway. So Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder told his servants to go back and fetch more gold, saying he would cover that piece also.</p>  
 <p>Then thought <i>G</i>eta the Kumâra, 'This can be no ordinary matter <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">2</font></a> for which this householder is ready to lavish so much gold!' And he said to Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, 'It is enough, O householder. You need not have that space covered. Let me have that space, and it shall be my gift.'</p>  
 <p>Then Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder thought <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">3</font></a>, 'This <i>G</i>eta the Kumâra is a very distinguished and illustrious person. Great would be the efficacy of the adherence of so well known a man as he to this doctrine and discipline.' And he gave up that</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>space to <i>G</i>eta the Kumâra. And <i>G</i>eta the Prince erected thereon a gateway, with a room over it.</p>  
 <p>And Anâtha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder built <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">1</font></a> dwelling-rooms, and retiring-rooms, and store-rooms (over the gateways), and service halls, and halls with fire-places in them, and storehouses (outside the Vihâra) <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and closets, and cloisters, and halls for exercise, and wells, and sheds for the well <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and bath-rooms, and halls attached to the bath-rooms, and ponds, and open-roofed sheds <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

It is no longer uncertain that the word means 'delicacy' of some sort. Whether the term was more <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a> precise, and denoted some particular delicacy or not, is still doubtful. Compare the passages quoted in our note above on Mahâvagga VI, 14, 3 (adding <i>G</i>âtaka I, 186, and <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 4, 5, VIII, 4, 4), which show that it was eaten with boiled rice or congey; is mentioned along with ghee and oil; and could be made from the flesh (or other parts) of a sucking-pig. If it were not for the latter circumstance (<i>G</i>âtaka I, 197) it might well be pickles or chutney.</p>
