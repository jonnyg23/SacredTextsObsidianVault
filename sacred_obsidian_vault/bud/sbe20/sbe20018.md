 <p>1. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to sing the Dhamma with the abrupt transitions of song-singing.</p>  
 <p>The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as [do so]?' The Bhikkhus heard (&amp;c., as usual, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'These five dangers, O Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with the abrupt <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">1</font></a> transitions of song-singing.--He himself becomes captivated with respect to the sound thereof.--Other people become captivated with respect to the sound thereof.--The laymen are shocked.--The meditation of one who strains after accuracy in the sound is broken.--The common people fall into heresy <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">2</font></a>.--These five dangers, O Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with the abrupt transitions of song-singing. The Dhamma is not, O Bhikkhus, to be sung [in that manner]. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhus were afraid to make use of intoning <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">3</font></a>. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to intone.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_143"></a><a href="sbe20018.htm#fr_148">72:1</a> Âyatakena gîta-ssarena. Compare âyataken’ eva papâto at <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 1, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="sbe20018.htm#fr_149">72:2</a> Probably this is supposed to result because dhamma being sung and not said is not intelligible to them--a complaint often made against the singing of prayers among Protestant Christians. On pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>imâ <i>g</i>anatâ, compare the closing words of V, 21, 2; and on the rest of the phrase, Puggala III, 10, 14 The translation of sarakutti<i>m</i> is also very doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_145"></a><a href="sbe20018.htm#fr_150">72:3</a> Sara-bha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i>. So in the Mahâvagga we hear that So<i>n</i>a <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> intoned before the Buddha a chapter from the Sutta Nipâta. The expression there used is sarena abhâsi, of which our word is used as the verbal noun, the roots bha<i>n</i> and bhâs being not only synonymous but interchangeable. (See, for instance, Vin. Pit. vol. iv, p. 353.) Perhaps 'recitative' would be a good rendering. I have several times heard the Dhamma thus recited by living Buddhists in accordance with the traditional interpretation of this passage, and their Sara-bha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> was precisely like the intoning of prose passages as practised in our cathedral churches (Rh. D.).</p>
