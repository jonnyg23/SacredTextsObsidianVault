 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the Kalandaka Nivâpa, in the Bamboo Grove.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who had realised Arahatship when he was seven years old, had entered into possession of every (spiritual gift) which can be acquired by a disciple; there was nothing left that he ought still to do, nothing left that he ought to gather up of the fruit of his past labour <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And when the venerable Dabba the Mallian had retired into solitude, and was sunk in thought, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'Arahatship had I</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>acquired when I was seven years old. I have gained everything that a learner can reach to. There is nothing further left for me to do, nothing to gather up of the fruit of that which I have done. What service is it possible for me to render to the Sa<i>m</i>gha?' And it occurred to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: 'It would be a good thing for me to regulate the lodging-places for the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and to apportion the rations of food.'</p>  
 <p>2. And when, at eventide, the venerable Dabba the Mallian had arisen from his meditations, he went to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side; and when he was so seated the venerable Dabba the Mallian spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>  
 <p>'When I had retired, Lord, into solitude and was sunk in thought, the following consideration presented itself to my mind (&amp;c., as before, down to) It would be a good thing for me to regulate the lodging-places for the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and to apportion the rations of food. I desire, Lord, [so to do].'</p>  
 <p>'Very good, Dabba. Do you then regulate the lodging-places for the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and apportion the rations of food!'</p>  
 <p>'It is well, Lord,' said the venerable Dabba the Mallian, accepting the word of the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>3. And the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection, when he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Let then the Sa<i>m</i>gha, O Bhikkhus, appoint Dabba the Mallian as the regulator of lodging-places, and as the apportioner of rations. And thus, O Bhikkhus, should the appointment be made.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>  
 <p>'First Dabba should be asked (whether he is willing to undertake the office). When he has been asked, some able and discreet Bhikkhu should lay the resolution before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me.</p>  
 <p>'"If it be convenient to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha appoint Dabba the Mallian as regulator of lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. '"This is the resolution (<i>ñ</i>atti).</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me.</p>  
 <p>'"The Sa<i>m</i>gha appoints the venerable Dabba the Mallian as regulator of lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. Whosoever of the venerable ones agrees that Dabba should be so appointed, let him remain silent; whosoever does not agree, let him speak. The venerable Dabba is appointed by the Sa<i>m</i>gha as regulator of the lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>  
 <p>4. And the venerable Dabba the Mallian, being so chosen, appointed one lodging-place in the same place for the Bhikkhus who belonged to the same division. For those Bhikkhus who were repeaters of the Suttantas he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to chant over the Suttantas to one another.' For those Bhikkhus who were in charge of the Vinaya he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to discuss the Vinaya one with another.' For those Bhikkhus who were preachers of the Dhamma he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to talk over the Dhamma one with another.' For those Bhikkhus who were given to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>meditation <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">1</font></a> he appointed one lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will not disturb one another.' For those Bhikkhus who were wise in worldly lore, and abounding in bodily vigour <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he appointed one lodging-place together, thinking, 'These venerable ones, too, will thus remain settled according to their pleasure.' And for such Bhikkhus as came in late, for them he caught fire <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and by the light of the flame thereof he pointed out to them a lodging-place.</p>  
 <p>So much so <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">4</font></a> that Bhikkhus of set purpose would come in late, thinking, 'We shall thus behold the power of the Iddhi of the venerable Dabba the Mallian.' And they went up to the venerable Dabba the Mallian, and said: 'Appoint us, O venerable Dabba, a lodging-place.'</p>  
 <p>And to them the venerable Dabba the Mallian would speak thus: 'Where do the venerable ones desire to rest? Where shall I appoint it?'</p>  
 <p>And they of set purpose would designate some place afar, saying, 'May the venerable Dabba appoint us a lodging-place on the Vulture's Peak; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Robber's Cliff; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Black Rock on the Isigili Passa; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging on the Vebhâra Passa; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Sattapa<i>n</i><i>n</i>i Cave; may the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the mountain cave of the Snake's Pool in Sîta's Wood; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Goma<i>t</i>a Grotto; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the cave of the Tinduka Tree; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Tapoda Ghât; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Tapoda Ârâma; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in <i>G</i>îvaka's Mango Grove; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the deer-park at Maddaku<i>k</i><i>kh</i>i.'</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Dabba the Mallian would burst into flame, and walk on in front of them with his finger burning, and they by the light thereof would follow close upon the venerable Dabba the Mallian. And the venerable Dabba the Mallian would appoint them a lodging-place, saying, 'This is the couch, and this the stool, and this the mat, and this the pillow, and this the privy place, and this the drinking-water <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and this the water for washing, and this the staff <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and this the form of (the result of) the consultation of the Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">3</font></a>, that at such and such a time are you to enter thereon, and at such and such a time are you to depart therefrom <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' And when the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>venerable Dabba the Mallian had thus appointed unto them their lodging-place, he would return back again to the Bamboo Grove.</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a> had been but recently received into the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and were wanting in merit, and such among the lodging-places appertaining to the Sa<i>m</i>gha as were inferior fell to their lot, and the inferior rations <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the people of Râ<i>g</i>agaha were desirous of presenting to the Thera Bhikkhus a wishing-gift <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">3</font></a>, to wit, ghee and oil and dainty bits <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">4</font></a>; while to the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka they used to give an ordinary gift according to their ability, to wit, scraps of food and sour gruel with it <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>When they had returned from their receipt of alms, and had eaten their meal, they asked the Thera Bhikkhus, 'What did you get, Sirs, at the place of alms; what did you get?'</p>  
 <p>Some of the Theras answered, Sirs; 'We had ghee, we had oil, we had dainty bits.'</p>  
 <p>The Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka replied: 'We got nothing at all, Sirs; just an ordinary gift such as they could manage, scraps of food, and sour gruel with it.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now at that time a certain householder, possessed of good food <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">1</font></a>, used to give a perpetual alms to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, a meal for four Bhikkhus. He with his wife and children used to stand at the place of alms and serve; and offer to some Bhikkhus boiled rice, and to some congey, and to some oil, and to some dainty bits.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the meal for the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka had been fixed for the morrow at the house of this prosperous</p>  
 <p>householder. 'And the prosperous householder went to the Ârâma for some business or other, and went up to the place where the venerable Dabba the Mallian was. And when he had come there, he saluted the venerable Dabba the Mallian, and took his seat on one side. And him so seated did the venerable Dabba instruct, and arouse, and gladden, and incite with religious discourse.</p>  
 <p>And when the prosperous householder had thus been instructed, and aroused, and gladdened, and incited by the venerable Dabba the Mallian with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>religious discourse, he said to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: 'For whom, Sir, has the meal been appointed to-morrow at our house?'</p>  
 <p>'The meal has been appointed, my friend, at your house to-morrow for those Bhikkhus who are followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka.'</p>  
 <p>Then the prosperous householder was ill-pleased, thinking, 'How can bad Bhikkhus enjoy themselves at our house?' And going home he gave command to the slave-girl: 'For those who come to-morrow for the meal, spread out the mats in the entrance hall <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and serve them with scraps of food,, and with sour gruel with it!'</p>  
 <p>'Even so, Sir!' said the slave-girl, accepting the word of the householder.</p>  
 <p>7. Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka spake one to another: 'Yesterday a meal has been appointed for us at the house of the prosperous householder. To-morrow he, with his wife and children, will attend upon us at the place of alms, and serve us. And he will offer to some of us boiled rice, and to some congey, and to some oil, and to some dainty bits. And through joy thereat they slept uneasily that night.</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, having robed themselves in the early morning, went duly bowled and robed to the dwelling-place of the prosperous householder. And that slave-girl saw the Bhikkhus who were followers</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka approaching from afar; and spreading out the mats in the entrance hall, she said to them, 'Be seated, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka thought: 'For a certainty the meal cannot yet be ready, since we are told to take our seats in the entrance.'</p>  
 <p>Then the slave-girl coming up with scraps of food, and sour gruel with it, said to them, 'Eat, Sirs!'</p>  
 <p>'We, sister, are of those for whom perpetual meals are provided.'</p>  
 <p>'I know, Sirs, that you are so. But only yesterday I received command from the householder that for them who should come to-morrow for the meal I was to spread out the mats in the entrance hall, and serve them with scraps of food, and some gruel with it. Eat, Sirs!'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka thought: 'It was yesterday that the householder, the prosperous one, came to the Ârâma to visit Dabba the Mallian. For a certainty the householder must have been set against us by Dabba the Mallian.' And through sorrow thereat they ate uneasily. And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, when they had finished their meal, returned from the receipt of alms, went to the Ârâma, and laid aside their bowls and their robes, and sat down outside the porch of the Ârâma, squatting against their waist cloths <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>silent, and ashamed, with fallen hearts <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and sunken faces, moody, and bewildered <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. Now the Bhikkhunî Mettiyâ came up to the place where the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka were: and when she had come there she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'</p>  
 <p>When she had so said the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka did not speak to her. So a second time she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs!' and they did not speak. And a third time she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs!' Still the third time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka did not speak. And she said: 'Wherein have I offended you, Sirs? Wherefore do you not speak to me?'</p>  
 <p>'Are you then so indifferent <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">4</font></a>, sister, when we are tormented by Dabba the Mallian?'</p>  
 <p>'But what can I do, Sirs?'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>'If you like, sister, you could this very day make the Blessed One expel the venerable Dabba the Mallian.'</p>  
 <p>'But what shall I do, Sirs? What is it that it is in my power to do?'</p>  
 <p>'Come now, sister; do you go to the place where the Blessed One is, and when you have come there say as follows: "This, Lord, is neither fit nor proper that the very quarter of the heavens which should be safe, secure, and free from danger, that from that very quarter should come danger, calamity, and distress--that where one might expect a calm, one should meet a gale. Methinks the very water has taken fire. I have been defiled, Lord, by Dabba the Mallian!'</p>  
 <p>'Very well, Sirs!' said the Bhikkhunî Mettiyâ, accepting the word of the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka. And she went to the Blessed One [and spake even as she had been directed].</p>  
 <p>9. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the venerable Dabba the Mallian:</p>  
 <p>'Are you conscious <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">1</font></a>, Dabba, of having done such a thing as this Bhikkhunî says?'</p>  
 <p>'Even as my Lord, the Blessed One, knows me.' [And a second and a third time the Blessed One asked the same question, and received the same reply.]</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then said the Blessed One: 'The Dabbas, O Dabba, do not thus repudiate <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If you have done it, say so. If you have not done it, say you have not.'</p>  
 <p>'Since I was born, Lord, I cannot call to mind <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">2</font></a> that I have practised sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake!'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Expel then, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhunî Mettiyâ, and examine those Bhikkhus about it.' And so saying he rose from his seat and entered into the Vihâra.</p>  
 <p>Then those Bhikkhus expelled the Bhikkhunî Mettiyâ. But the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka said to those Bhikkhus: 'Do not, Sirs, expel the Bhikkhunî Mettiyâ. She has not committed any offence. She has been set on by us with angry and bitter intentions of causing his fall.'</p>  
 <p>'What then, Sirs? is it you who are thus harassing the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge and breach of morality?'</p>  
 <p>'That is true, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>Then those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant and annoyed and complained, saying, 'How can these Bhikkhus the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka harass the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge of breach of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>morality?' And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is this true, O Bhikkhus?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>Let then the Sa<i>m</i>gha grant to Dabba the Mallian, whose conscience in respect of this matter is quite clear, the Proceeding for the consciously innocent <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be granted.</p>  
 <p>'Let that Dabba the Mallian go before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and having arranged his robe over one shoulder, let him bow down at the feet of the senior Bhikkhus; and crouching down <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">2</font></a>, let him stretch</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>forth his hands with the palms joined together, and let him say, "These Bhikkhus, Sirs, the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, are harassing me by a groundless charge of breach of morality. But I, Sirs, in respect thereof have a clear conscience, and I ask the Sa<i>m</i>gha for the acquittal to be accorded to those who are conscious of innocence." Then some able and discreet Bhikkhu is thus to lay the resolution (<i>ñ</i>atti) before the Sa<i>m</i>gha. "Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus, Sirs, the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, are harassing the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge of a breach of morality, and the venerable Dabba the Mallian has in respect thereof a conscience that is clear, and asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. If the time is convenient to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha accord to the venerable Dabba the Mallian the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. This is the resolution. Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. The Sa<i>m</i>gha accords to the venerable Dabba the Mallian the acquittal of those who are consciously innocent. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the grant to Dabba the Mallian of the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence, let him keep silence, Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. And a second time I say the same thing. And a third time I say the same thing. Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. These Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) let him speak. The acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence has been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>granted by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to Dabba the Mallian. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">1</font></a>."'</p>  
 <p>11. 'There are five things which make a grant of acquittal to those who are conscious of innocence to be according to law. The Bhikkhu must be innocent and without offence, others must have censured him, he must ask the Sa<i>m</i>gha for acquittal as being conscious of innocence, the Sa<i>m</i>gha must grant it, the Sa<i>m</i>gha must be duly held and duly constituted. These, O Bhikkhus, are the five things which make a grant of the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence to be according to law.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_18"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_19">9:4</a> Uttaribhaṅgam. See the passages quoted in the note on Mahâvagga VI, 14, 3. These three things are also mentioned together at VIII, 4, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_19"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_20">9:5</a> These expressions recur at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 228. The Samanta Pâsâdikâ says merely <i>k</i>a<i>n</i>âgakan ti sakuntaka-bhatta<i>m</i>. Bilaṅgadutiyan ti <i>k</i>a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ika-dutiya<i>m</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_21"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_22">11:1</a> Ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>ake, which means the battlemented gateway which formed the entrance to an important house; and in which there was a room. See <i>G</i>âtaka I, 227.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_22"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_23">12:1</a> Sa<i>m</i>ghâ<i>t</i>i-pallatthikâya. There is a misprint in the text (°ttikâya). On this curious expression, see below, V, 28, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_23"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_24">13:1</a> Pattakkhandhâ, which the Samanta Pâsâdikâ explains by patitakkhandhâ. Khandhâ here seems to mean 'faculties.' Compare the use of Dhammâ in a similar connection at Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta II, 32 = Mahâvagga V, 13, 9; and see Buddhaghosa's commentary on that passage, quoted by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli,' p. 36.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_24"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_25">13:2</a> Appa<i>t</i>ibhânâ. Pa<i>t</i>ibhâna<i>m</i> is the rapid suggestion of an idea in a case of doubt or difficulty, an illumination; so that pa<i>t</i>ibhânako, the man of ready wit, may be compared with upâya-kusalo, the man fertile in resource. 'Absent-minded' would be an incorrect rendering; they had no idea what to think or do, and the appearance of the nun on the scene (in the next paragraph) supplied the want. Till then they hesitated, drifted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_25"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_26">13:3</a> The following narrative, down to § 9, is repeated almost word for word in V, 20, only that the person there persuaded to bring the false accusation is different.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_26"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_27">13:4</a> A<i>g</i><i>gh</i>upekkhati. Compare <i>G</i>âtaka I, 147.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_27"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_28">14:1</a> Literally, 'Do you recollect?' But it is quite clear from the technical words at the close of this section that the verb sarati had already acquired the secondary meaning 'to be conscious of.' The whole story is peculiarly valuable as illustrating the growth of the connotation of the verb and its allied meanings, and indirectly the origin and growth of the idea of 'conscience' which has played so great a part in theological and ethical speculation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_29">15:1</a> That is, 'Men of character and standing such as yours, O Dabba, are not in the habit of repudiating a charge in so indirect a manner by adverting merely to their standing and known character.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_29"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_30">15:2</a> Here the word used is abhi<i>g</i>ânâmi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_30"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_31">16:1</a> Dabbassa sati-vepulla-ppattassa sati-vinaya<i>m</i> detu. The explanation of the compound sati-vepulla-ppatto given by Childers, though it rests on so good an authority as that of Vi<i>g</i>esi<i>m</i>ha Mudaliar, cannot be right. He makes it mean 'a man of great intellectual development.' But sati must here refer to the fact that Dabba has been formally called upon to remember (sarîto) whether he did or did not commit the offence. And though the exact sense of the compound is subject to some doubt, the general sense of the clause must be very much as we have conjecturally rendered it. On this formal appeal to the conscience, or memory (sati), of a Bhikkhu charged with an offence, or supposed to have offended, see <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 2, and 5 at the end; and X, 20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_31"></a><a href="sbe20005.htm#fr_32">16:2</a> Ukku<i>t</i>ika<i>m</i> nisîditvâ. This verb does not mean 'to sit on the hams,' as rendered by Childers. The exact posture, unknown in Europe, is to crouch down on the feet (keeping both toes and heels on the ground) in such a way that the hams do not touch the ground, but come within an inch or two of it. Europeans find it very difficult to retain this posture for any length of time, but the natives of India find it easy, and it is regarded in the Pi<i>t</i>akas as a posture of humility.</p>
