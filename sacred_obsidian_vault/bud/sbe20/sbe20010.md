 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus in chapter (Sa<i>m</i>gha) assembled, since they became violent, quarrelsome, and disputatious, and kept on wounding one another with sharp words <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">4</font></a>, were unable</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>to settle the disputed question (that was brought before them).</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p> <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to settle such a dispute by the vote of the majority. A Bhikkhu who shall be possessed of five qualifications shall be appointed as taker of the voting tickets--one who does not walk in partiality, one who does not walk in malice, one who does not walk in folly, one who does not walk in fear <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">2</font></a>, one who knows what (votes) have been taken and what have not been taken.</p>  
 <p>'And thus shall he be appointed.</p>  
 <p>'First the Bhikkhu is to be requested (whether he will undertake the office). Then some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to bring the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. If the time seems meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha appoint a Bhikkhu of such and such a name as taker of the voting tickets.</p>  
 <p>'"This is the motion (<i>ñ</i>atti).</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. The Sa<i>m</i>gha appoints a Bhikkhu of such and such a name as taker of the tickets. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the Bhikkhu of such and such a name being appointed as taker of the</p>

 <p>tickets, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. The Bhikkhu of such and such a name is appointed by the Sa<i>m</i>gha as taker of the voting tickets. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand.'"</p>
