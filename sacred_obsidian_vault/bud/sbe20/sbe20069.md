 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill as long as he thought fit, he proceeded on his journey towards Â<i>l</i>avî; and in due course he arrived at Â<i>l</i>avî, and there, at Â<i>l</i>avî, the Blessed One stayed at the Aggâ<i>l</i>ava Shrine.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus of Â<i>l</i>avî <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">2</font></a> used to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>give new building operations in charge (to one or other of their number) <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">1</font></a>, such as the following <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">2</font></a> when some clay or earth had merely to be put aside in heaps, when a wall had merely to be re-plastered, when a door had merely to be made, when the socket for a bolt had merely to be made, when some joinery-work had merely to be done to a window, when some whitewashing merely had to be done, or some black colouring laid on, or some red colouring <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or some roofing-work, or some joinery, or a bar had to be fixed to a door <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">4</font></a>, when breaches or decay had merely to be repaired <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">5</font></a>, or the flooring to be re-plastered <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">6</font></a>; and they assigned this office to one another for terms of twenty or thirty years, or</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>for life; or they gave in charge a completely finished Vihâra to a Bhikkhu for such time as should elapse till the smoke rose (from the funeral pyre on which his body should be burnt <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>  
 <p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. (as usual, down to) The Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to confer the office of building overseer when clay has merely to be put aside in heaps . . . . (&amp;c., as before, down to) body shall be burnt. Whosoever shall so confer it, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give a Vihâra not yet begun, or not yet finished <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in charge as a new building. And with reference to the work on a small Vihâra, it may be given in charge as a navakamma for a period of five or six years, that on an A<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ayoga for a period of seven or eight years, that on a large Vihâra or a Pâsâda for ten or twelve years.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhus gave the whole of a Vihâra as a navakamma (to one Bhikkhu to superintend)--or two Vihâras to one Bhikkhu--or the Bhikkhu who had taken the work in charge got another (Bhikkhu to live there and take charge for him)--or the Bhikkhu who had taken in charge a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>building belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha kept exclusive possession of it--or the Bhikkhus gave work in charge to one not at that time within the boundary <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">1</font></a>--or Bhikkhus who had once taken charge kept exclusive possession for all time.</p>  
 <p>They told [each of] these matters to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do [any one of these things]. Whosoever does, he is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. And the Bhikkhu in charge may take one good sleeping-place into his exclusive possession for the three months of the rainy, but not during the dry season.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time Bhikkhus who had taken charge of building operations left the place [or otherwise became incompetent in one or other of the twenty and three ways set out in the next paragraph <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">2</font></a>].</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'In case that occurs, O Bhikkhus, as soon as he has taken charge, or before the building has been completed, let the office be given to another lest there should be loss to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. In case the building has been completed, O Bhikkhus, if he then leaves the place, it (the office and its privileges) is still his--if he then returns to the world, or dies, or admits that he is a sâma<i>n</i>era, or that he has abandoned the precepts, or that he has become guilty of an extreme offence, the Sa<i>m</i>gha</p>

 <p>becomes the owner <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">1</font></a>--if he then admits that he is mad, or that his mind is unhinged, or that he is afflicted with bodily pain, or that he has been suspended for his refusal to acknowledge an offence, or to atone for an offence, or to renounce a sinful doctrine, it (the office and its privileges) is still his--if he then admits that he is a eunuch, or that he has furtively attached himself to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or that he has gone over to the Titthiyas, or that he is an animal, or that he has murdered his mother, or his father, or an Arahat, or that he has violated a Bhikkhunî, or that he has caused a schism in the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or that he has shed (a Buddha's) blood, or that he is an hermaphrodite, then the Sa<i>m</i>gha becomes the owner.'</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_594"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_604">212:2</a> The Bhikkhus of Â<i>l</i>avî are frequently mentioned in connection <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a> with offences in relation to the navakamma<i>m</i>. See, for instance, Pârâ<i>g</i>ika III, 5, 30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_605">213:1</a> For the rule authorising such giving in charge in general cases, see above, VI, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_596"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_606">213:2</a> For most of the following technical terms in building, see our notes above on <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 11, and V, 1, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_597"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_607">213:3</a> See our note on this phrase above, V, 11, 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_598"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_608">213:4</a> Ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikadhâna-mattenâ ti dvâra-bâhâna<i>m</i> upari-kapo<i>t</i>a-ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika-yo<i>g</i>ana-mattena (B.). Ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>i is used in this sense at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 237. Compare the use of Dhamma-ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ, 'block of execution,' at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 150, II, 124. The word ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ occurs also at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 474 (last line), in the sense of 'bunch:' but it is there probably a misprint; for Oldenberg, in the parallel passage at Bhikkhunî-vibhaṅga, Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya I, 1, reads bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ike. That the two words are easily confused in Burmese writing is shown by the fact that the Berlin (Burmese) copy of Buddhaghosa reads here also bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâdhâna-mattenâ ti, &amp;c., and again afterwards bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_599"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_609">213:5</a> See our note on this phrase above, VI, 5, 2.</p>

The very same expression is used in a wholly doubtful sense, and of some process of tailoring, in. Mahâvagga VII, 1, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_601"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_611">214:1</a> Dhûmakâlikan ti ida<i>m</i> yâv’ assa <i>k</i>itaka-dhûmo na pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>âyatîti tâva aya<i>m</i> vihâro etass’ evâ ti eva<i>m</i> dhûma-kâle apaloketvâ kata-pariyosita<i>m</i> vihâra<i>m</i> denti (B.). The word recurs below, applied to sikkhâpada<i>m</i>, in XI, 1, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_602"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_612">214:2</a> Vîppakatan ti ettha vippakato nâma yâva gopânasiyo na ârohanti. Gopânasîsu pana âru<i>l</i>hâsu bahukato nâma hoti: tasmâ tato pa<i>t</i><i>th</i>âya na dâtabbo (B.). The use of bahukato is noteworthy. for in the only other passage where we have found the word (Mahâvagga VI, 36, 2), it has a totally different application. There is possibly a misreading in the one MS. available. (? pakato.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_603"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_613">215:1</a> See above, VI, 11, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_604"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_614">215:2</a> See Mahâvagga II, 22, 3, and II, 36, 1-3. In the latter of these two passages the three cases are omitted. In Mahâvagga IX, 4, 2, and 8, the whole 23 are given.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_605"></a><a href="sbe20069.htm#fr_615">216:1</a> That is, the navakammiko loses his privileges (his lien on the best sleeping-place, &amp;c.).</p>
