 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'If, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhunî, or a novice under training to become one (a Sikkhamânâ), when on her death-bed, should say: "After I am gone, let my set of necessaries belong to the Sa<i>m</i>gha," then it is the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha it belongs to; the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha is not the owner thereof.
