 <p>1. 'Now, O Bhikkhus, an official act carried out against a Bhikkhu who has confessed himself guilty is invalid as follows, and is valid as follows. And how does such an official act become invalid? In case a Bhikkhu have committed a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence, and in respect thereof either the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu warns him, saying, "The venerable one has been guilty of a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika." And he replies thus, "I have not, Sirs, been guilty of a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika. I have been guilty of a Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa." And in respect thereof the Sa<i>m</i>gha deals with him for a Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa. Then that official act is invalid.'</p>

 <p>[And so also if on being warned of any one of the seven offences <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a> he confesses himself to be guilty of any one of the offences different from the one charged, then the official act is invalid.]</p>  
 <p>2. 'And when, O Bhikkhus, is such an official act valid? In case a Bhikkhu have committed a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence, and in respect thereof the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu warns him, saying, "The venerable one has been guilty of a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika." And he replies, "Yea, Sirs, I have been guilty of a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika." And in respect thereof the Sa<i>m</i>gha deals with him for a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika. Then that official act is valid <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>[And so for each of the other offences mentioned in § 1, the whole of § 2 is repeated.]</p>
