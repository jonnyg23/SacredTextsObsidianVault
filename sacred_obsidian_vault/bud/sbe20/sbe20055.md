 <p>1. Now at that time the sleeping-rooms of the Titthiyas were whitewashed, the floors of their rooms were coloured black, and the walls coloured with red chalk <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Much people went to look at their sleeping-rooms.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use in your Vihâras of whitewash, black colouring, and red colouring.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the whitewash would not lie on to the rough walls.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply the husks of grain made up into little balls; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands <a name="fr_492"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to lay on the whitewash.'</p>  
 <p>The whitewash would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply soft clay; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to lay on the whitewash.'</p>  
 <p>(Still) the whitewash would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of slime <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">3</font></a> (of trees) or of paste <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>Now at that time the colouring matter of red chalk would not lie on the rough walls.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply the husks of grain made up into little balls; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands, to lay on the colouring matter of red chalk.'</p>  
 <p>The red colour would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply clay mixed with the red powder which adheres to the grain of rice under the husks <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and when you have so taken off the unevenness with your hands to lay on the red colouring matter.'</p>  
 <p>Still the red colouring matter would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a paste made of mustard seed <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of oil of beeswax <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' </p>  
 <p>It lay on the wall too thickly in great drops <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wipe it down with a cloth <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the black colouring matter did not lie on the rough ground.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply husks of grain</p>

 <p>made up into little balls; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands, to lay on the black colouring matter.'</p>  
 <p>The black colouring matter would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply clay mixed with (the excrement of) earth-worms <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands, to lay on the black colouring matter.'</p>  
 <p>Still the black colouring matter would not adhere.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of slime and astringent liquid <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had imaginative drawings <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">3</font></a> painted on their Vihâras--figures of men, and figures of women.</p>  
 <p>People, when they saw them on going to visit the Vihâras; murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like those who still enjoy the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have imaginative drawings painted figures of men, and figures of</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a></p>  
 <p>women. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, representations of wreaths and creepers and bone hooks and cupboards <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time the Vihâras had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6 as to roofing, stairs, and balustrade).</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Vihâras were crowded with people <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The Bhikkhus were ashamed to lie down to sleep.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of curtains.'</p>  
 <p>They lifted up the curtains and looked in.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to put up a lath and plaster wall half the height of the Vihâra.'</p>  
 <p>They looked on from over this half-wall.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make inner chambers of three kinds--chambers in shape like a palankeen <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">3</font></a>, chambers in shape like a quart measure <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and chambers on an upper storey <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus made inner chambers in the middle of small Vihâras, and there was no room to move about in.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make the inner chambers at one side of small Vihâras, and in the middle of large ones <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>4. Now at that time the lower part of the lath and plaster wall of the Vihâra decayed.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, buttresses of timber <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Rain leaked through on to the lath and plaster wall of the Vihâra <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a protecting arrangement <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">4</font></a> and cement <a name="fr_513"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time a snake fell from the roof on to the back of a certain Bhikkhu. He was terrified, and made an outcry <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">6</font></a>. The Bhikkhus, running up, said to that Bhikkhu: 'Why, Sir, do you make an outcry?' Then that Bhikkhu told the matter to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Bhikkhus, and they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a ceiling-cloth.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time the Bhikkhus hung their bags at the feet of the bedsteads, and at the feet of the chairs; and they were gnawed by the mice and white ants.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, pins in the wall, and bone hooks <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus laid aside their robes on the bedsteads and on the chairs, and the robes were torn.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, bamboos to hang your robes on, and strings to hang your robes on <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Vihâras had no verandahs, and no defences <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, verandahs <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">4</font></a>, covered terraces <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">5</font></a>, inner verandahs <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and over-hanging eaves <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">7</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>The verandahs were. too public; and the Bhikkhus were ashamed to lie down in them to sleep.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, an arrangement in form of a curtain that can be drawn aside <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_512"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or an arrangement in form of a moveable screen <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when taking their midday meal in the open air, were troubled by cold and heat.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a Service Hall.'</p>  
 <p>The Service Hall had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, down to the end).</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus spread their robes out on the ground in the open air, and they became dirty.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bamboos to hang robes on, and strings to hang robes in, in the open air.</p>  
 <p>7. The water became warm.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a water-room and a water-shed.'</p>  
 <p>The water-room had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, down to the end).</p>  
 <p>There were no vessels for the water.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, chank shells and saucers for the water.'</p>  
 <p>8. Now at that time the Vihâras had no fence round them.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to enclose them with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>ramparts (Pâkâra) of three kinds--brick walls, stone walls, and wooden fences.'</p>  
 <p>There was no store-room <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a store-room.'</p>  
 <p>The store-room had too low a basement, and it was flooded with water.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it with a high basement.'</p>  
 <p>The store-room had no door.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a door; with door-posts and lintel, with hollows like a mortar for the door to revolve in, with projections to revolve in those hollows, with rings on the door for the bolt to work along in, with a block of wood fixed into the edge of the door-post, and containing a cavity for the bolt to go into (called the Monkey's Head), with a pin to secure the bolt by, with a connecting bolt, with a key-hole, with a hole for a string with which the door may be closed, and with a string for that purpose <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Grass and plaster fell from the store-room.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as in V, 14, 4. down to the end of V, 14, 5, as to roofing, flooring, drains, &amp;c.).'</p>  
 <p>9. Now at that time the Bhikkhus made fire-places here and there in the Parive<i>n</i>a, and the Parive<i>n</i>a was covered with the remains of the fires <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make a separate room for the fire at one side.'</p>  
 <p>The fire-room had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, as to flooring, stairs, and balustrade, followed by the paragraph as to the door, and the facing, as in V, 14, 3, &amp;c.).</p>  
 <p>10. Now at that time the Ârâmas had no fences to them, and goats and cattle injured the plantations <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to surround them with fencing of three kinds--bamboo fences, thorn fences, and ditches.'</p>  
 <p>There was no gateway (k o t l h a k a), and goats and cattle, even so, injured the plantations.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a gateway, with gates made of stakes interlaced with thorny brakes <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with fences (across the gateway) made of the akka plant <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">3</font></a>, with ornamental screen-work over the gateway <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and with bars.'</p>  
 <p>[Then the paragraphs allowing the roofing, &amp;c., of this ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka as in V, 11, 6, and drains for the Ârâma, as in V, 14, 3.]</p>  
 <p>11. Now at that time Seniya Bimbisâra, the king of Magadha, wanted to build a pâsâda <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">5</font></a> (residence),</p>

 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>covered with cement and clay, for the use of the Sa<i>m</i>gha. And it occurred to the Bhikkhus, 'What kind of roof now has been allowed by the Blessed One, and what kind of roof has not been allowed?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, roofing of five kinds--brick roofing, stone roofing, cement roofing, straw roofing, and roofing of leaves.'</p>

Perhaps 'gateway' should be chosen as the rendering here, as it clearly must be in the closely allied passage in the next section but one (§ 10). As the chamber supposed always to be built over the gateway could be used as a store-room, the difference is not very essential.</p>

In later times it meant a building of several storeys, each successive storey being smaller in superficial area than the one immediately beneath it. Compare the Mahâ-loha-pâsâda so often mentioned in the Mahâva<i>m</i>sa (pp. 161-257), the stone pillars of the lowest stories of which are still one of the sights of Anurâdhapura.</p>
