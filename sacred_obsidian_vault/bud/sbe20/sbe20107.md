 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhus had come into the possession of some bedding, and the Bhikkhunîs had none. The Bhikkhunîs sent a messenger to the Bhikkhus, saying: 'It would be well if their reverences the Bhikkhus would give us some bedding on loan <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give bedding to the Bhikkhunîs on loan.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time Bhikkhunîs, in their courses, sat down or lay down on stuffed bedsteads and chairs, and the stuffing was soiled with blood.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to sit down or lie down on a stuffed bedstead or chair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow the use, O Bhikkhus, of an indoor's robe <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>The indoor's robe got soiled.</p>

 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a thigh-cloth (a cloth to reach nearly down to the knee <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">1</font></a>).'</p>  
 <p>The thigh-cloth slipped down.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow it, O Bhikkhus, to be fastened by a thread to be tied round the thigh.'</p>  
 <p>The thread broke.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a loin-cloth, and a string going round the hips (to keep it up) <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhunîs used to wear the hip-string always. The people murmured, &amp;c., saying: 'Like the women who still enjoy the pleasures of the world!' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear a hip-string for constant use <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">3</font></a>. I allow its use to one who is in her courses.'</p>
