Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Bodhi tree to the A<i>g</i>apâla banyan tree (banyan tree of the goat-herds<a name="page_79_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_79_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>).

 <p>   <a name="2:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. Now a certain Brâhma<i>n</i>a, who was of a haughty disposition<a name="page_79_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_79_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he exchanged greeting with the Blessed One; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, he stationed himself near him; then standing near him that Brâhma<i>n</i>a thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'By what, Gotama; does one become a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and what are the characteristics that make a man a Brâhma<i>n</i>a?'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="2:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. And the Blessed One, having heard that, on this occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'That Brâhma<i>n</i>a who has removed (from himself) all sinfulness, who is free from haughtiness, free from impurity, self-restrained, who is an accomplished master of knowledge (or, of the Veda), who has fulfilled the duties of holiness, such a Brâhma<i>n</i>a may

Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the A<i>g</i>apâla banyan tree to the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree.

 <p>   <a name="3:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. At that time a great cloud appeared out of season, rainy weather which lasted seven days, cold weather, storms, and darkness. And the Nâga (or Serpent) king Mu<i>k</i>alinda came out from his abode, and seven times encircled the body of the Blessed One with his windings, and kept extending his large hood over the Blessed One's head, thinking to himself: 'May no coldness (touch) the Blessed One! May no heat (touch) the Blessed One! May no vexation by gadflies and gnats, by storms and sunheat and reptiles (touch) the Blessed One!'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="3:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. And at the end of those seven days, when the Nâga king Mu<i>k</i>alinda saw the open, cloudless sky, he loosened his windings from the body of the Blessed One, made his own appearance disappear, created the appearance of a youth, and stationed himself in front of the Blessed One, raising his clasped hands, and paying reverence to the Blessed One.</p>

And the Blessed One, perceiving that, on this occasion, pronounced this solemn utterance: 'Happy is the solitude of him who is full of joy, who has learnt the Truth, who sees (the Truth). Happy is freedom from malice in this world, (self-)restraint towards all beings that have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this world, getting beyond all desires; the putting away of that pride which comes from the thought "I am!" This truly is the highest happiness!'</p>

Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree to the Râ<i>g</i>âyatana (tree<a name="page_81_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_81_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>); when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Râ<i>g</i>âyatana tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="4:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants, came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that place. Then a deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relatian of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants
 
 <!------------------------page 82------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a>
 
 Tapussa and Bhallika: 'Here, my noble friends, at the foot of the Râ<i>g</i>âyatana tree, is staying the Blessed One, who has just become Sambuddha. Go and show your reverence to him, the Blessed One, by (offering him) rice-cakes and lumps of honey. Long will this be to you for a good and for a blessing.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="4:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. And the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they stationed themselves near him; standing near him, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that that may long be to us for a good and for a blessing! </p>
 
 <p>   <a name="4:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. Then the Blessed One thought: 'The Tathâgatas<a name="page_82_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_82_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> do not accept (food) with their hands. Now
 
 <!------------------------page 83------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a>
 
 with what shall I accept the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' Then the four Mahârâ<i>g</i>a gods<a name="page_83_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_83_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, understanding by the power of their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the horizon) four bowls made of stone (saying), 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' The Blessed One accepted those new stone bowls; and therein be received the rice-cakes and honey lumps, and those, when he had received, he ate.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="4:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. And Tapussa and Bhallika, the merchants, when they saw that the Blessed One had cleansed<a name="page_83_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_83_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> his bowl and his hands, bowed down in reverence

 at the feet of the Blessed One and thus addressed the Blessed One: 'We take our refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One and in the Dhamma; may the Blessed One receive us as disciples who, from this day forth while our life lasts, have taken their refuge (in him).' These were the first in the world to become lay-disciples (of the Buddha) by the formula which contained (only) the dyad<a name="page_84_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_84_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.</p>

 <p>   <a name="5:1"></a><font color="GREEN">1</font>. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Râ<i>g</i>âyatana tree to the A<i>g</i>apâla banyan tree. And when he had reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of the A<i>g</i>apâla banyan tree.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose: 'I have penetrated this doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted, which is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the wise. This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who

 <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a>
 
 are given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire, the law of causality and the chain of causation will be a matter difficult to understand; most difficult for them to understand will be also the extinction of all sa<i>m</i>khâras, the getting rid of all the substrata (of existence<a name="page_85_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_85_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>), the destruction of desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirvâ<i>n</i>a! Now if I proclaim the doctrine, and other men are not able to understand my preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. And then the following . . . .<a name="page_85_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_85_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> stanzas, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One: 'With great pains have I acquired it. Enough! why should I now proclaim it? This doctrine will not be easy to understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.</p>
 
 <p>   'Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness, they will not see what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound, difficult to perceive, and subtle.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. When the Blessed One pondered over this matter, his mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine. Then Brahmâ
 
 <!------------------------page 86------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a>
 
 Sahampati<a name="page_86_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_86_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, understanding by the power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, thought: 'Alas! the world perishes! Alas! the world is destroyed! if the mind of the Tathâgata, of the holy, of the absolute Sambuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. Then Brahmâ Sahampati disappeared from Brahma's world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly) as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his out-stretched arm.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. And Brahmâ Sahampati adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine! may the perfect One preach the doctrine! there are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the doctrine, they cannot attain salvation. These will understand the doctrine.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:7"></a><font color="GREEN">7</font>. Thus spoke Brahmâ Sahampati; and when he had thus spoken, he further said: 'The Dhamma hitherto manifested in the country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men. But do thou now open the door of the Immortal<a name="page_86_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_86_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>; let them hear the doctrine discovered by the spotless One!</p>
 
 <p>   'As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's

 top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O wise One, ascending to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing One, upon the people lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay,--thou, who hast freed thyself from suffering!</p>
 
 <p>   'Arise, O hero; O victorious One! Wander through the world, O leader of the pilgrim band, who thyself art free from debt. May the Blessed One preach the doctrine; there will be people who can understand it!'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:8"></a><font color="GREEN">8</font>. When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to Brahmâ Sahampati: 'The following thought, Brahmâ, has occurred to me: "I have penetrated this doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of § 2)." And also, Brahmâ, the following . . . .<a name="page_87_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_87_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> stanzas have presented themselves to my mind, which had not been heard (by me) before: "With great pains, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of § 3)." When I pondered over this matter, Brahmâ, my mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:9"></a><font color="GREEN">9</font>. And a second time Brahmâ Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as in §§ 6, 7).' And for the second time the Blessed One said to Brahmâ Sahampati: 'The following thought . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:10"></a><font color="GREEN">10</font>. And a third time Brahmâ Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</p>
 
 <p>   Then the Blessed One, when he had heard Brahmâ's solicitation, looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over the world, with his (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha,
 
 <!------------------------page 88------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a>
 
 saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings whose eyes were covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of sense, of good disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some of them seeing the dangers of future life and of sin.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:11"></a><font color="GREEN">11</font>. As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge over the water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, reach to the surface of the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, stand emerging out of the water, and the water does not touch them,--</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:12"></a><font color="GREEN">12</font>. Thus the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened, . . . . (&amp;c., the text repeats § 10); and when he had thus seen them, he addressed Brahmâ Sahampati in the following stanza: 'Wide opened is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let them send forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not, Brahmâ, despairing of the weary task, to men.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="5:13"></a><font color="GREEN">13</font>. Then Brahmâ Sahampati understood: 'The Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the doctrine.' And he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his right side towards him; and then he straightway disappeared.</p>

 'Highly noble was Uddaka Râmaputta. If he had heard my doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'</p>

 <p>   <a name="6:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. Now the Blessed One thought: 'Where do the five Bhikkhus dwell now?' And the Blessed One saw by the power of his divine, clear vision, surpassing that of men, that the five Bhikkhus were living at Benares, in the deer park Isipatana<a name="page_90_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_90_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a>.

Now Upaka, a man belonging to the Â<i>g</i>îvaka sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling on the road, between Gayâ and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Your countenance, friend, is serene; your complexion is pure and bright.

 <p>   <a name="6:8"></a><font color="GREEN">8</font>. When Upaka the Â<i>g</i>îvaka had spoken thus, the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: 'I have overcome all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire. Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being is like me. I am the holy One in this world, I am the highest teacher, I alone am the absolute Sambuddha; I have gained coolness (by the extinction of all passion) and have obtained Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. To found the Kingdom of Truth I go to the city of the Kâsis (Benares); I will beat the drum of the Immortal in the darkness of this world.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:9"></a><font color="GREEN">9</font>. (Upaka replied): 'You profess then, friend, to be the holy, absolute <i>G</i>ina<a name="page_91_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_91_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.'</p>
 
 <p>   (Buddha said): 'Like me are all <i>G</i>inas who have reached extinction of the Âsavas<a name="page_91_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_91_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>; I have overcome (<i>g</i>itâ me) all states of sinfulness; therefore, Upaka, am I the <i>G</i>ina.'</p>
 
 <p>   When he had spoken thus, Upaka the Â<i>g</i>îvaka replied: 'It may be so, friend;' shook his head, took another road, and went away.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:10"></a><font color="GREEN">10</font>. And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Benares, to the deer park Isipatana, to the place where the five Bhikkhus were. And

 <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a>
 
  the five Bhikkhus saw the Blessed One coming from afar; when they saw him, they concerted with each other, saying, 'Friends, there comes the sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, who lives in abundance, who has given up his exertions, and who has turned to an abundant life. Let us not salute him; nor rise from our seats when he approaches; nor take his bowl and his robe from his hands. But let us put there a seat; if he likes, let him sit down.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:11"></a><font color="GREEN">11</font>. But when the Blessed One gradually approached near unto those five Bhikkhus, the five Bhikkhus kept not their agreement. They went forth to meet the Blessed One; one took his bowl and his robe, another prepared a seat, a third one brought water for the washing of the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<a name="page_92_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_92_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>. Then the Blessed One sat down on the seat they had prepared; and when he was seated, the Blessed One washed his feet. Now they addressed the Blessed One by his name, and with the appellation 'Friend.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:12"></a><font color="GREEN">12</font>. When they spoke to him thus, the Blessed One said to the five Bhikkhus: 'Do not address, O Bhikkhus, the Tathâgata by his name, and with the appellation "Friend." The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute Sambuddha. Give ear, O Bhikkhus! The immortal (Amata) has been won (by me); I will teach you; to you I preach the doctrine. If you walk in the way I show you, you will, ere long, have penetrated to the truth, having yourselves known it and seen it face to face; and you

 <p>   <a name="6:13"></a><font color="GREEN">13</font>. When he had spoken thus, the five monks said to the Blessed One: 'By those observances, friend Gotama, by those practices, by those austerities, you have not been able to obtain power surpassing that of men, nor the superiority of full and holy knowledge and insight. How will you now, living in abundance, having given up your exertions, having turned to an abundant life, be able to obtain power surpassing that of men, and the superiority of full and holy knowledge and insight?'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:14"></a><font color="GREEN">14</font>. When they had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to the five Bhikkhus: 'The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, does not live in abundance, he has not given up exertion, he has not turned to an abundant life.

 <p>   'You have never spoken so, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   'The Tathâgata, O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute Sambuddha. Give ear, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c. (as above).'</p>
 
 <p>   And the Blessed One was able to convince the five Bhikkhus; and the five Bhikkhus again<a name="page_94_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_94_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> listened willingly to the Blessed One; they gave ear, and fixed their mind on the knowledge (which the Buddha imparted to them).</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="6:17"></a><font color="GREEN">17</font>. And the Blessed One thus addressed the five Bhikkhus<a name="page_94_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_94_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>: 'There are two extrernes, O Bhikkhus, which he who has given up the world, ought to avoid.

By avoiding these two extrernes, O Bhikkhus, the Tathâgata has gained the knowledge of the Middle Path which leads to insight, which leads to wisdom, which conduces to calm, to knowledge, to the Sambodhi, to Nirvâ<i>n</i>a.</p>

When Yasa, the noble youth, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course: that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, about the duties of morality, about heaven, about the evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness of desires, and about the blessings of the abandonment of desire<a name="page_104_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_104_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.</p>

Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject also to the condition of cessation.'</p>

Now the mother of Yasa, the noble youth, having gone up to his palace, did not see Yasa, the noble youth, and she went to the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder (her husband), and having approached him, she said to the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder: 'Your son Yasa, O householder, has disappeared.' Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, sent messengers on horseback to the four quarters of the horizon; and he went himself to the deer park Isipatana. Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, saw on the ground the marks of the gilt slippers; and when he saw them, he followed them up.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:8"></a><font color="GREEN">8</font>. And the Blessed One saw the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, coming from afar. On seeing him, he thought: 'What if I were to effect such an exercise of miraculous power, that the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa, the noble youth, who is sitting here also.' And the Blessed One effected such an exercise of his miraculous power.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:9"></a><font color="GREEN">9</font>. And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Pray, Lord, has the Blessed One seen Yasa, the noble youth?'</p>
 
 <p>   'Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also.'</p>

 <p>   And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, who thought: 'Indeed, sitting here I shall see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also I became glad and joyful, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:10"></a><font color="GREEN">10</font>. When the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course; that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, . . . . (&amp;c., as at end of § 5). And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord! glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed One preached the doctrine in many ways. I take my refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the fraternity of Bhikkhus; may the Blessed One receive me from this day forth while my life lasts as a disciple who has taken his refuge in Him.'</p>

 released from the Âsavas. Then the Blessed One thought: 'Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered to his father, has contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the Âsavas. It is impossible that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and enjoy pleasures, as he did before, when he lived in his house. What if I were now to put an end to that exertion of my miraculous power.' And the Blessed One put an end to that exertion of his miraculous Power.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:12"></a><font color="GREEN">12</font>. Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, saw Yasa, the noble youth, sitting there. On seeing him he said to Yasa, the noble youth: 'My son Yasa, your mother is absorbed in lamentation and grief; restore your mother to life.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:13"></a><font color="GREEN">13</font>. Then Yasa, the noble youth, looked at the Blessed One. And the Blessed One said to the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder: 'What do you think then, O householder? That Yasa has (first) won only an imperfect<a name="page_107_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_107_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> degree of knowledge and insight into the Truth, as you have yourself? Or that rather he was contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and that his mind has thus become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the Âsavas? Now would it then be possible, O householder, that Yasa should return to the world and enjoy pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house?'</p>
 
 <p>   'Not so, Lord.'

 'Yasa, the noble youth, O householder, had (first) won, like yourself, an imperfect degree of knowledge and insight into the Truth. But when he was contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood, his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the Âsavas. It is impossible, O householder, that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and enjoy pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:14"></a><font color="GREEN">14</font>. 'It is all gain, Lord, to Yasa, the noble youth, it is high bliss, Lord, for Yasa, the noble youth, that the mind of Yasa, the noble youth, has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the Âsavas. Might, Lord, the Blessed One consent to take his meal with me to-day together with Yasa, the noble youth, as his attendant?'</p>
 
 <p>   The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent. Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and passing round him with his right side towards him, departed thence.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="7:15"></a><font color="GREEN">15</font>. And Vasâ, the noble youth, soon after the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, was gone, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let me receive the pabba<i>gg</i>â and upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed One.'</p>
 
 <p>   'Come, O Bhikkhu,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of suffering.'</p>

 <p>   'It is not disagreeable to me, great Sama<i>n</i>a, but there is a savage Nâga (or Serpent) king of great magical power<a name="page_119_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_119_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, a dreadfully venomous serpent; let him do no harm to you.'</p>

 <p>   'It is not disagreeable,' &amp;c.</p>

And the Nâga saw that the Blessed One had entered; when he saw that, he became annoyed, and irritated, and sent forth a cloud of smoke.

And the Blessed One, converting his body into fire<a name="page_120_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_120_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>, sent forth flames. When they both shone forth with their flames, the fire room looked as if it were burning and blazing, as if it were all in flames.

That night having elapsed, the Blessed One, leaving intact the skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and marrow of that Nâga, and conquering the Nâga's fire by his fire, threw him into his alms-bowl, and showed him to the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila Uruvelâ Kassapa (saying), 'Here you see the Nâga, Kassapa; his fire has been conquered by my fire.' Then the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila Uruvelâ Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great Sama<i>n</i>a possesses high magical powers and great faculties, in that he is able to conquer by his fire the fire of that savage Nâga king, who is possessed of magical power, that dreadfully venomous serpent.

 <p>   When he saw that Kassapa had given his permission, fearlessly He, who had overcome all fear, entered. When the chief of Serpents saw that the Sage had entered, he became irritated, and sent forth a cloud of smoke. Then the chief of men<a name="page_121_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_121_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, joyful and unperplexed, also sent forth a cloud of smoke.

 <p>   Then the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila Uruvelâ Kassapa went to those <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas; having gone to them, he said to those <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas: 'I wish, Sirs, to lead a religious life under the direction of the great Sama<i>n</i>a; you may do, Sirs, what you think fit.'</p>
 
 <p>   (The <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas replied): 'We have conceived, Sir, an affection for the great Sama<i>n</i>a long since; if you will lead. Sir, a religious life under the great Sama<i>n</i>a' s direction; we will all lead a religious life under the great Sama<i>n</i>a's direction.'</p>

And the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila Nadî Kassapa saw the hair, the braids, the provisions, the things for the agnihotra sacrifice, which were carried down by the river; when he saw that, he became afraid that some misfortune might have befallen his brother. He sent some <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, saying, 'Go and look after my brother,' and went himself with his three hundred <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas to the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa; having approached him, he said to the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa: 'Now, Kassapa, is this bliss?'</p>

 <p>   'The eye, O Bhikkhus, is burning; visible things are burning; the mental impressions based on the eye are burning; the contact of the eye (with visible things) is burning; the sensation produced by the contact of the eye (with visible things), be it pleasant, be it painful, be it neither pleasant nor painful, that also is burning. With what fire is it burning? I declare unto you that it is burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of anger, with the fire of ignorance; it is burning with (the anxieties of) birth, decay, death, grief, lamentation, suffering, dejection, and despair.</p>

 <p>   <a name="22:1"></a><font color="GREEN">1</font>. And the Blessed One, after having dwelt at Gayâsisa as long as he thought fit, went forth to Râ<i>g</i>aha, accompanied by a great number of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas before. And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Râ<i>g</i>agaha. There the Blessed One dwelt near Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the La<i>tth</i>ivana pleasure garden, near the sacred shrine of Supati<i>tth</i>a<a name="page_136_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_136_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra heard: 'The Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama Sakyaputta, an ascetic of the Sakya tribe, has just arrived at Râ<i>g</i>agaha and is staying near Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the La<i>tth</i>ivana pleasure garden, near the sacred shrine of Supati<i>tth</i>a. Of Him the blessed Gotama such a glorious fame is spread abroad: "Truly he is the blessed, holy, absolute Sambuddha, endowed with knowledge and conduct, the most happy One, who understands all worlds, the highest One, who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, the teacher of gods and men, the blessed Buddha. He makes known the Truth, which he has understood himself and seen face to face, to this world system with its devas, its Mâras, and its Brahmâs; to all beings, Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as,

 gods and men; he preaches that Truth (Dhamma) which is glorious in the beginning, glorious in the middle, glorious at the end, in the spirit and in the letter; he proclaims a consummate, perfect, and pure life." It is good to obtain the sight of holy men (Arahats) like that.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, surrounded by twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders<a name="page_137_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_137_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. And of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders some also respectfully saluted the Blessed One and sat down near him; some exchanged greeting with the Blessed One, having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, they sat down near him; some bent their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat down near him; some shouted out their name and their family name before the Blessed One and sat down near him; some silently sat down near him.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. Now those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders thought: 'How now is this? has the great Sama<i>n</i>a placed himself under the spiritual direction of Uruvelâ Kassapa, or has Uruvelâ Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual direction of the great Sama<i>n</i>a?'</p>
 
 <p>   And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa
 
 <!------------------------page 138------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a>
 
 in this stanza: 'What knowledge have you gained, O inhabitant of Uruvelâ, that has induced you, who were renowned for your penances<a name="page_138_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_138_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, to forsake your sacred fire? I ask you, Kassapa, this question: How is it that your fire sacrifice has become deserted?'</p>
 
 <p>   (Kassapa replied): 'It is visible things and sounds, and also tastes, pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak of<a name="page_138_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_138_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>; because I understood that whatever belongs to existence<a name="page_138_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_138_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> is filth, therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings<a name="page_138_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_138_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a>.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. 'But if your mind, Kassapa (said the Blessed One<a name="page_138_fr_5"></a><a href="#page_138_note_5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a>), found there no more delight,--either in visible things, or sounds, or tastes,--what is it in the world of men or gods in which<a name="page_138_fr_6"></a><a href="#page_138_note_6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a> your mind, Kassapa, now finds delight?

 <p>   (Kassapa replied): 'I have seen the state of peace (i.e. Nirvâ<i>n</i>a) in which the basis of existence (upadhi<a name="page_138_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_138_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a>) and the obstacles to perfection

 <p>   <a name="22:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. Then the venerable Uruvelâ Kassapa rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, prostrated himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am his pupil; my teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am his pupil.' Then those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders understood: 'Uruvelâ Kassapa has placed himself under the spiritual direction of the great Sama<i>n</i>a.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:7"></a><a name="22:8"></a><font color="GREEN">7, 8</font>. And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders, preached to them in due course (&amp;c., as in chap. 7, §§ 5, 6, down to:). Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus eleven myriads of those Magadha Brâhma<i>n</i>as and householders with Bimbisâra at their head, while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject
 
 <!------------------------page 140------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a>
 
 also to the condition of cessation.' One myriad announced their having become lay-pupils.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:9"></a><font color="GREEN">9</font>. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, having seen the Truth (&amp;c. . . . . down to) dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the Teacher's doctrine, said to the Blessed One: 'In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I entertained five wishes; these are fulfilled now. In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I wished: "O that I might be inaugurated as king." This was my first wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might then the holy, absolute Sambuddha come into my kingdom." This was my second wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:10"></a><font color="GREEN">10</font>. '"And might I pay my respects to Him, the Blessed One." This was my third wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might He the Blessed One preach his doctrine (Dhamma) to me." This was my fourth wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might I understand His, the Blessed One's doctrine." This was my fifth wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. These were the five wishes, Lord, which I entertalned in former days when I was a prince; these are fulfilled now.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:11"></a><font color="GREEN">11</font>. 'Glorious, Lord! (&amp;c., as in chap. 7. 10, down to:) who has taken his refuge in Him. And might the Blessed One, Lord, consent to take his meal with me to-morrow together with the fraternity of Bhikkhus.'</p>
 
 <p>   The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:12"></a><font color="GREEN">12</font>. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra, when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and, passing round him with his right side towards him, went away.

 <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a>
 
 And when the night had elapsed, the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra ordered excellent food, both hard and soft, to be prepared, and had dinner-time announced to the Blessed One in the words: 'It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.' And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his under-robes, took his alms-bowl, and with his <i>k</i>îvara on entered the city of Râ<i>g</i>agaha accompanied by a great number of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas before.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:13"></a><font color="GREEN">13</font>. At that time Sakka the king of the devas, assuming the appearance of a young Brâhman, walked in front of the Bhikkhu fraternity with Buddha at its head, singing the following stanzas: 'The self-controlled One with the self-controlled, with the former <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, the released One with the released, the Blessed One, gold-coloured like an ornament of si<u>n</u>gî gold<a name="page_141_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_141_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, has entered Râ<i>g</i>agaha.</p>

 <p>   'He who has crossed (the ocean of passion) with them who have crossed (it), with the former <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, the released One with the released, the Blessed One, gold-coloured like an ornament of si<u>n</u>gi go1d, has entered Râ<i>g</i>agaha.</p>
 
 <p>   'He who is possessed of the ten Noble States<a name="page_141_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_141_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>

 and of the ten Powers<a name="page_142_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_142_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, who understands the ten Paths of Kamma<a name="page_142_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_142_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and possesses the ten (attributes of Arahatship)<a name="page_142_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_142_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a>, the Blessed One, surrounded by ten hundred of followers, has entered Râ<i>g</i>agaha.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:14"></a><font color="GREEN">14</font>. The people when they saw Sakka the king of the devas, said: 'This youth indeed is handsome; this youth indeed has a lovely appearance; this youth indeed is pleasing. Whose attendant may this youth be?'</p>
 
 <p>   When they talked thus, Sakka the king of the devas addressed those people in this stanza: 'He who is wise, entirely self-controlled, the unrivalled Buddha, tie Arahat, the most happy upon earth: his attendant am I.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:15"></a><font color="GREEN">15</font>. And the Blessed One went to the palace of the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra. Having gone there, he sat down with the Bhikkhus who followed him, on seats laid out for them. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra with his own hands served and offered excellent food, both hard and soft, to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at

 <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a>
 
 its head; and when the Blessed One had finished his meal and cleansed his bowl and his hands, he sat down near him.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:16"></a><font color="GREEN">16</font>. Sitting near him the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra thought: 'Where may I find a place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible for all people who want (to see him), by day not too crowded, at night not exposed to much noise and alarm, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life?'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:17"></a><font color="GREEN">17</font>. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra thought: 'There is the Ve<i>l</i>uvana<a name="page_143_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_143_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, my pleasure garden, which is not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, . . . . (&amp;c., down to a retired life). What if I were to make an offering of the Ve<i>l</i>uvana pleasure garden to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head?'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="22:18"></a><font color="GREEN">18</font>. And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisâra took a golden vessel (with water in it, to be poured over the Buddha's hand); and dedicated (the garden) to the Blessed One (by saying), 'I give up this Ve<i>l</i>uvana pleasure garden, Lord, to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head.' The Blessed One accepted the ârâma (park). Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated, and gladdened the Magadha king Seniya

 Bimbisâra by religious discourse, rose from his seat and went away.</p>
 
 <p>   And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to receive the donation of an ârâma (a park).'</p>

 <p>   And the Blessed One saw them, Sâriputta and Moggallâna, coming from afar; on seeing them he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'There, O Bhikkhus, two companions arrive, Kolita and U patissa<a name="page_149_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_149_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>; these will be a pair of (true) pupils, a most distinguished, auspicious pair.</p>

 them: 'These two companions who are now coming--Kolita and Upatissa--these will be a pair of (true) pupils, a most distinguished, auspicious pair.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="24:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. Then Sâriputta and Moggallâna went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, they prostrated thernselves, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let us receive the pabba<i>gg</i>â and upasampadâ ordinations from the Blessed One.'</p>
 
 <p>   'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of suffering.' Thus these venerable persons received the upasampadâ ordination.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="24:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. At that time many distinguished young Magadha noblemen led a religious life under the direction of the Blessed One. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'The Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes fathers to beget no sons; the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes wives to become widows; the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes families to become extinct. Now he has ordained one thousand <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, and he has ordained these two hundred and fifty paribbâ<i>g</i>akas who were followers of Sa<i>ñg</i>aya; and these many distingtiished young Magadha noblemen are now leading a religious life under the direction of the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama.' And moreover, when they saw the Bhikkhus, they reviled them in the following stanza: 'The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come to Giribba<i>g</i>a (i.e. Râ<i>g</i>agaha) of the Magadha people, leading with hi in all the follawers of Sa<i>ñg</i>aya; who will be the next to be led by him?'</p>

 annoyed, murmured, and had hecome angry; these Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. (He replied): 'This noise, O Bhikkhus, will not last long; it will last only seven days; after seven days it will he over. And if they revile you, O Bhikkhus, in this stanza: "The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come, &amp;c.," you should reply to the revilers in the following stanza: "It is by means of the true doctrine that the great heroes, the Tathâgatas, lead men. Who will murmur at the wise, who lead men by the power of the Truth?"'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="24:7"></a><font color="GREEN">7</font>. At that time the people, when seeing the Bhikkhus, reviled them in the following stanza: 'The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come, &amp;c.'

 <p>   Then the people understood: 'It is by truth, and not by wrong, that the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as lead men;' and thus that noise lasted only seven days, and after seven days it was over.</p>

 and instruction, went on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments (or, wearing their under and upper garments improperly), and in an improper attire. While people were eating, they held out their alms-bowls in which were leavings of food<a name="page_152_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_152_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, over the hard food (which the people were eating), and held them out over soft food, and held them out over savoury food, and held them out over drinks. They asked for soup and boiled rice themselves, and ate it; in the dining halls they made a great and loud noise.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments, . . . . (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to drinks)? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls? They behave like Brâhma<i>n</i>as at the dinners given to them.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, frugal, modest, conscientious,

 anxious for training, were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus go on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments, &amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls?'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>
 
 <p>   In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, having ordered the fraternity of Bhikkhus to assemble, questioned the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that some Bhikkhus go on their rounds, . . . . (&amp;c., down to), that they make a great and loud noise in the dining halls?'</p>
 
 <p>   'It is true, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing, it is unbecoming, indecent, un worthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, go on their rounds, &amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted; but it will result, O Bhikkhus, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith), and in many of the converted being estranged.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. And the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus in many ways, spoke against unfrugality, ill-nature, immoderation, insatiableness, delighting in society, and indolence; spoke in many ways in praise of frugality, good-nature, of the moderate, contented, who have eradicated (sin), who have shaken off (sin), of the gracious, of the reverent, and of the energetic. And having delivered beforethe Bhikkhus a religious

 discourse in accordance to, and in conformity with these subjects, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>
 
 <p>   'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, (that young Bhikkhus choose) an upa<i>ggh</i>âya (or preceptor).</p>
 
 <p>   'The upa<i>ggh</i>âya, O Bhikkhus, ought to consider the saddhivihârika (i.e. pupil) as a son; the saddhivihârika ought to consider the upa<i>ggh</i>âya as a father. Thus these two, united by mutual reverence, confidence, and communion of life, will progress, advance, and reach a high stage in this doctrine and discipline.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="25:7"></a><font color="GREEN">7</font>. 'And let them choose, O Bhikkhus, an upa<i>ggh</i>âya in this way: Let him (who is going to choose an upa<i>ggh</i>âya) adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, salute the feet (of the intended upa<i>ggh</i>âya), sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "Venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>âya; venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>âya; venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>âya." (If the other answer): "Well," or, "Certainly," or, "Good," or, "All right," or, "Carry on (your work) with friendliness (towards me)," or should he express this by gesture (lit. by his body). or by word, or by gesture and word, then the upa<i>ggh</i>âya has been chosen. If he does not express this by gesture, nor by word, nor by gesture and word, the upa<i>ggh</i>âya has not been chosen.</p>

 let him give (to the upa<i>ggh</i>âya) the teeth-cleanser and water to rinse his mouth with. Then let him prepare a seat (for the upa<i>ggh</i>âya). If there is rice-milk, let him rinse the jug and offer the rice-milk (to the upa<i>ggh</i>âya). When he has drunk it, let him give water (to the upa<i>ggh</i>âya), take the jug, hold it down, rinse it properly without (damaging it by) rubbing, and put it away.

Then this Brâhma<i>n</i>a went to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the pabba<i>gg</i>â ordination; the Bhikkhus conferred the pabba<i>gg</i>â and upasampadâ ordinations on him.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="30:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. When he had been ordained, the arrangement of successive meals (with the rich upâsakas) came to an end. The Bhikkhus said to him: 'Come, friend, let us now go on our rounds for alms.'</p>
 
 <p>   He replied: 'I have not embraced the religious life for that purpose--to going about for alms; if you give me (food), I will eat; if you do not, I will return to the world.'</p>
 
 <p>   (The Bhikkhus said): 'What, friend! have you indeed embraced the religious life for your belly's sake?'</p>
 
 <p>   'Yes, friends.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="30:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can a Bhikkhu embrace the religious life in so well-taught a doctrine and discipline for his belly's sake?'</p>

 <p>   These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>
 
 <p>   (The Buddha said): 'Is it true, O Bhikkhu, that you have embraced the religious life for your belly's sake?'</p>
 
 <p>   (He replied): 'It is true, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   Then the blessed Buddha rebuked that Bhikkhu: 'How can you, foolish person that you are, embrace the religious life in so well-taught a doctrine and discipline for your belly's sake? This will not do, O foolish one, for converting the unconverted and for augmenting the number of the converted.'</p>
 
 <p>   Having rebuked him and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="30:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that he who confers the upasampadâ ordination (on a Bhikkhu), tell him the four Resources.</p>
 
 <p>   'The religious life has morsels of food given in alms for its resource. Thus you must endeavour to live all your life. Meals given to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to certain persons, invitations, food distributed by ticket, meals given each fortnight, each uposatha day (i.e. the last day of each fortnight), or the first day of each fortnight, are extra allowances.</p>
 
 <p>   'The religious life has the robe made of rags taken from a dust heap for its resource. Thus you must endeavour to live all your life. Linen, cotton, silk, woollen garments, coarse cloth, hempen cloth are extra allowances.</p>

 <p>   <a name="31:1"></a><font color="GREEN">1</font>. At that time a certain youth came to the Bhikkhus and asked them to be ordained. The Bhikkhus told him the (four) Resources before his ordination. Then he said: 'If you had told me the Resources, venerable Sirs, after my ordination, I should have persisted (in the religious life); but now, venerable Sirs, I will not be ordained; the Resources are repulsive and loathsome to me.'</p>
 
 <p>   The Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>
 
 <p>   'You ought not, O Bhikkhus, to tell the Resources (to the candidates) before their ordination. He who does, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you tell the Resources (to the newly-ordained Bhikkhus) immediately after their upasampadâ.'</p>

 <p>   <a name="31:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. At that time some Bhikkhus performed the upasampadâ service with a chapter of two or three Bhikkhus.</p>
 
 <p>   They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>
 
 <p>   'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, receive the upasampadâ ordination before a chapter of less than ten Bhikkhus. He who performs the upasampadâ service (with a smaller number of Bhikkhus), is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. I prescribe you, O Bhikkhus, the holding of upasampadâ services with a chapter of ten Bhikkhus or more than ten.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="31:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. At that time some Bhikkhus conferred the upasampadâ ordination on their saddhivihârikas one or two years after their own upasampadâ. <a name="page_175_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_175_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>Thus also the venerable Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta conferred the upasampadâ ordination on a saddhivihârika of his one year after his own upasampadâ. When he had concluded the vassa residence, after two years from his own upasampadâ had elapsed, he went with his saddhivihârika, who had completed the first year after his upasampadâ, to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="31:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas to exchange greeting with incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to the venerable Upasena Va<u>n</u>gantaputta: 'Do things go well with you, Bhikkhu? Do you get enough to support your life? Have you made your journey with not too great fatigue?'</p>
 
 <p>   'Things go pretty well with us, Lord; we get
 
 <!------------------------page 176------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a>
 
 enough, Lord, to support our life, and we have made our journey, Lord, with not too great fatigue.' The Tathâgatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tathâgatas put questions full of sense, not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the Tathâgatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions to the Bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the doctrine or when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="31:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. And the Blessed One said to the venerable Upananda Va<u>n</u>gantaputta: 'How many years have you completed, O Bhikkhu, since your upasampadâ?'</p>
 
 <p>   'Two years, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   'And how many years has this Bhikkhu completed?'</p>
 
 <p>   'One year, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   'In what relation does this Bhikkhu stand to you?'</p>
 
 <p>   'He is my saddhivihârika, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   Then the blessed Buddha rebuked him: 'This is improper, O foolish one, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O foolish one, who ought to receive exhortation and instruction from others, think yourself fit for administering exhortation and instruction to another Bhikkhu? Too quickly, O foolish one, have you abandoned yourself to the ambition of collecting followers. This will not do (&amp;c.: as in chap. 30. 3). Let no one, O Bhikkhus, confer the upasampadâ ordination who has not

 <p>   <a name="31:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. At that time ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus (who said), 'We have completed ten years (since our upasampadâ), we have completed ten years,' conferred the upasampadâ ordination; (thus) ignorant upa<i>ggh</i>âyas were found and clever saddhivihârikas; unlearned upa<i>ggh</i>âyas were found and learned saddhivihârikas; upa<i>ggh</i>âyas were found who had small knowledge, and saddhivihârikas who had great knowledge; foolish upa<i>ggh</i>âyas were found and wise saddhivihârikas. And a certain Bhikkhu who had formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, when his upa<i>ggh</i>âya remonstrated with him (on certain offences) according to the Dhamma, brought his upa<i>ggh</i>âya (by reasoning) to silence and went back to that same Titthiya school<a name="page_177_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_177_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="31:7"></a><font color="GREEN">7</font>. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can those ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhus confer the upasampadâ ordination (saying); "We have completed ten years, we have completed ten years?" (Thus) ignorant upa<i>ggh</i>âyas are found and clever saddhivihârikas (&amp;c., down to:), foolish upa<i>ggh</i>âyas are found and wise saddhivihârikas.'</p>
 
 <p>   These Bhikkhus told, &amp;c.</p>
 
 <p>   'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>
 
 <p>   'It is true, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="31:8"></a><font color="GREEN">8</font>. Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus,

 <p>   Having rebuked those Bhikkhus and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no ignorant, unlearned Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, confer the upasampadâ ordination.

 <p>   <a name="49:1"></a><font color="GREEN">1</font>. At that time there was in Râ<i>g</i>agaha a company of seventeen boys, friends of each other; young Upâli<a name="page_201_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_201_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> was first among them. Now Upâli's father and mother thought: 'How will Upâli after our death live a life of ease and without pain?' Then Upâli's father and mother said to themselves: 'If Upâli could learn writing, he would after our death live a life of ease and without pain.' But then Upâli's father and mother thought again: 'If Upâli learns writing, his fingers will become sore. But if Upâli could learn arithmetic, he would after our death live a life of ease and without pain.'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="49:2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. But then Upâli's father and mother thought again: 'If Upâli learns arithmetic, his breast will become diseased<a name="page_201_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_201_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>. But if Upâli could learn money-changing<a name="page_201_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_201_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a>, he would after our death live a life of ease and comfort, and without pain.' But then Upâli's father and mother said to themselves: 'If Upâli learns money-changing, his eyes will suffer. Now here are the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, who keep commodious precepts and live a commodious life; they have good meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind. If Upâli could be ordained with the

 <p>   <a name="49:3"></a><font color="GREEN">3</font>. Now young Upâli heard his father and mother talking thus. Then young Upâli went to the other boys; having approached them, he said to those boys: 'Come, Sirs, let us get ordained with the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as.' (They replied): 'If you will get ordained, Sir, we will be ordained also.' Then those boys went each to his father and mother and said to them: 'Give me your consent for leaving the world and going forth into the houseless state.' Then the parents of those boys, who thought, 'It is a good thing what all these boys are wishing so unanimously for, gave their consent. They went to the Bhikkhus and asked them for the pabba<i>gg</i>â ordination. The Bhikkhus conferred the pabba<i>gg</i>â and upasampadâ ordinations on them.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="49:4"></a><font color="GREEN">4</font>. In the night, at dawn, they rose and began to cry: 'Give us rice-milk, give us soft food, give us hard food!' The Bhikkhus said: 'Wait, friends, till day-time. If there is rice-milk, you shall drink; if there is food, soft or hard, you shall eat; if there is no rice-milk and no food, soft or hard, you must go out for alms, and then you will eat.'</p>
 
 <p>   But those Bhikkhus, when they were thus spoken to by the other Bhikkhus, threw their bedding about and made it wet, calling out: 'Give us rice-milk, give us soft food, give us hard food!'</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="49:5"></a><font color="GREEN">5</font>. Then the Blessed One, having arisen in the night, at dawn, heard the noise which those boys made; hearing it he said to the venerable Ânanda: 'Now, Ânanda, what noise of boys is that?'</p>
 
 <p>   Then the venerable Ânanda told the thing to the Blessed One.</p>

 <p>   'It is true, Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>   Then the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'How can those foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, knowingly confer the upasampadâ ordination on persons under twenty years of age?</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="49:6"></a><font color="GREEN">6</font>. 'A person under twenty years, O Bhikkhus, cannot endure coldness and heat, hunger and thirst, vexation by gadflies and gnats, by storms and sun-heat, and by reptiles; (he cannot endure) abusive, offensive language; he is not able to bear bodily pains which are severe, sharp, grievous, disagreeable, unpleasant, and destructive to life; whilst a person that has twenty years of age, O Bhikkhus, can endure coldness, &amp;c.

Only two boys were left; these, when seeing Bhikkhus, ran up to them according to their old custom, but the Bhikkhus turned them away. When they were turned away by the Bhikkhus, they cried. Now the venerable Ânanda thought: 'The Blessed One has forbidden us to confer the pabba<i>gg</i>â ordination

 <p>   The venerable Ânanda accepted this order of the Blessed One (by saying), 'Yes, Lord,' took a key, and said to the Bhikkhus in every cell: 'Friends, the Blessed One,' &amp;c.</p>

 <p>   'There are two occasions, O Bhikkhus, on which a serpent (who has assumed human shape) manifests his true nature: when he has sexual intercourse with a female of his species, and if he thinks himself safe (from discovery) and falls asleep.

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_73_note_1"></a><a href="#page_73_fr_1">1</a> To this book is prefixed, as introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's attaining Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples, Sâriputta and Moggallâna (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical or legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka, the discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account occupies by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For it contains the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably, for ever, of what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of their Master's life in its most important period.</p>
 
 <p>The connection in which this legendary narration stands with the main subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to account for. The regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity, which are discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves to the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>aka as being the very basis of their religious discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha without the Pâtimokkha rules, or without the regulations about the Pavâra<i>n</i>â festival, but it was impossible to realise the idea of a Sa<i>m</i>gha without rules showing who was to be regarded as a duly admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not. It is quite natural, therefore, that the stories or legends concerning the ordination of Bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the very first events of the history of the Sa<i>m</i>gha. Nor is it difficult to account for the theory formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law, of different successive forms in which the ordination of Bhikkhus had been performed. In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the Buddha himself who could ordain Bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be received, expressed their wish, and he conferred on them the pabba<i>gg</i>â and upasampadâ ordinations by the formula: 'Ehi bhikkhu,' &amp;c. (see I, 6, 32, 34, &amp;c.) It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the Sa<i>m</i>gha grew larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of admitting new members to the Bhikkhus themselves, and should have instituted that form of ordination which the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>aka found valid at their own time.</p>
 
 <p>The transition, however, from the supposed oldest form of ordination (the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampadâ) to that latter form is in the Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There is described an intermediate stage between the two, the ordination by the three sara<i>n</i>agamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated declaration of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa<i>m</i>gha (see Mahâvagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka to this construction, was most probably the important part which in the upasampadâ service of the later time devolved upon the preceptor (upa<i>ggh</i>âya) of the candidate. As only learned Bhikkhus, who had completed the tenth year after their own upasampadâ, could perform the function of upa<i>ggh</i>âya at the upasampadâ ordination of other Bhikkhus (Mahâvagga I, 31, 8), it was natural that the redactors of the Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form of upasampadâ service to the first times of Buddha's teaching. For these times, therefore, they recorded another form, the upasampadâ by the three sara<i>n</i>agamanas, the introduction of which they assigned, very naturally, to the time soon after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by which event the number of Bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven to sixty-one.</p>

The Mahâvagga, which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on the Mahâvagga; <i>G</i>âtaka Atthav. vol. i. p. 77 seq.; Dîpava<i>m</i>sa I, 29, 30; Lalita Vistara, p. 488 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 236 seq., &amp;c.)</p>

 <p><a name="page_75_note_1"></a><a href="#page_75_fr_1">1</a> The Chain of Causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nidânas (causes of existence), contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer to the same problem to which the second and third of the four Noble Truths (ariyasa<i>kk</i>a) also try to give a solution, viz. the problem of the origin and destruction of suffering. The Noble Truths simply reduce the origin of suffering to Thirst, or Desire (Ta<i>n</i>hâ), in its threefold form, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity (see I, 6, 20). In the system of the twelve nidânas Thirst also has found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted between to<i>n</i>hâ and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the investigation of causes is carried on further beyond to<i>n</i>hâ. The question is here asked, What does to<i>n</i>hâ come from? and thus the series of causes and effects is led back to aviggâ (Ignorance), as its deepest root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>akas, who of course could not but observe this parallelity between the second and third ariyasa<i>kk</i>as and the system of the twelve nidânas, go so far, in one instance (A<u>n</u>guttara-Nikâya, Tika-Nipâta, fol. <i>k</i>e of the Phayre MS.), as to directly replace, in giving the text of the four ariyasa<i>kk</i>as, the second and third of them by the twelve nidânas, in direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished a valuable note on the nidânas; see Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays (second edition), II, 453 seq.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_75_note_2"></a><a href="#page_75_fr_2">2</a> In the Sammâdi<i>tth</i>isuttanta (Ma<i>ggh</i>ima-Nikâya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) we find the following explanation of what Ignorance is: 'Not to know Suffering, not to know the Cause of suffering, not to know the Cessation of suffering, not to know the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering, this is called Ignorance.' The same is repeated in the explanation of the nidâna formula, which is given in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka, Pa<i>t</i>i<i>kk</i>asamuppâda-vibha<u>n</u>ga, fol. <i>k</i>i of the Phayre MS.), and we must accept it, therefore, as the authentic expression of Buddhistical belief. It is obvious, however, that this explanation leaves room for another question. Ignorance, we are told, is the source of all evil and of all suffering, and the subject ignored is stated to be the four Truths. But who is the subject that ignores them? All attributes (as the vi<i>ññ</i>â<i>n</i>a, &amp;c.), that constitute sentient beings and enable them to know or to ignore, are said to be first produced by Ignorance, and we shou1d conclude, therefore, that they cannot exist before Ignorance has begun to act. Or are we to understand that it is the Ignorance incurred by a sentient being in a preceding existence, that causes the sa<i>m</i>khâras and Consciousness, the connecting links between the different existences, to act and to bring about the birth of a new being?</p>
 
 <p>As is well known, this Ignorance (Avidyâ) plays a great part also in the Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no doubt, founded to a considerable extent on older theories. But we cannot venture in a note to touch upon one of the most difficult and interesting questions which await the research of Indianists.</p>

 <p><a name="page_76_note_1"></a><a href="#page_76_fr_1">1</a> It is very frequently stated that there are three sa<i>m</i>khâras or productions: kâyasa<i>m</i>khâra, va<i>k</i>isa<i>m</i>khâra, and <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>khâra, or, productions of body, of speech, and of thought (see, for instance, the Sammâdi<i>tth</i>isuttanta, Ma<i>ggh</i>ima-Nikâya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) The kâyasa<i>m</i>khâra consists, according to the Sa<i>m</i>khâra-Yamaka (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka), in inhalation and expiration (assâsapassâsâ); the va<i>k</i>îsa<i>m</i>khâra in attention and investigation (vitakkavi<i>k</i>ârâ); the <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>khâra in ideas, sensations, and all attributes of mind except attention and investigation (sa<i>ññ</i>â <i>k</i>a vedanâ <i>k</i>a <i>th</i>apetvâ vitakkavi<i>k</i>âre sabbe pi <i>k</i>ittasampayuttakâ dhammâ). The Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka, Pa<i>t</i>i<i>kk</i>asamuppâdavibha<u>n</u>ga, I.I.{sic. ?}) gives, when discussing the sa<i>m</i>khâras, six categories instead of the three: 'Now which are the sa<i>m</i>khâras that are produced by Ignorance? Sa<i>m</i>khâras (or, productions) that lead to righteousness, sa<i>m</i>khâras that lead to sinfulness, sa<i>m</i>khâras that lead to immovability, productions of body, of speech, and of thought.' The Pâli words are: 'Tattha katame avi<i>gg</i>âpa<i>kk</i>ayâ sa<i>m</i>khârâ? pu<i>ññ</i>âbhisa<i>m</i>khâro apu<i>ññ</i>âbhisa<i>m</i>khâro â<i>n</i>a<i>ñg</i>âbhisa<i>m</i>khâro kâyasa<i>m</i>khâro va<i>k</i>isa<i>m</i>khâro <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>khâro.'

 <p><a name="page_82_note_1"></a><a href="#page_82_fr_1">1</a> The term Tathâgata is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied to Sammâsambuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi<i>t</i>akas when the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person as 'the Tathâgata.' The meaning 'sentient being,' which is given to the word in the Abhidhânappadîpikâ, and in Childers's Dictionary, is not confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the Pi<i>t</i>akas. This translation of the word is very possibly based merely on a misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi<i>t</i>aka: hoti tathâgato para<i>m</i> mara<i>n</i>â, which means, of course, 'does a Buddha exist after death?' In the <i>G</i>aina books we sometimes find the term tatthagaya (tatragata), 'he who has attained that world, i.e. emancipation,' applied to the <i>G</i>inas as opposed to other beings who are called ihagaya (idhagata), 'living in this world.' See, for instance, the <i>G</i>ina<i>k</i>aritra, § 16. Considering the close relation in which most of the dogmatical terms of the <i>G</i>ainas stand to those of the Bauddhas, it is difficult to believe that tathâgata and tatthagaya should not originally have conveyed very similar ideas. We think that on the long way from the original Mâgadhî to the Pâli and Sanskrit, the term tatthagata or tatthâgata (tatra + âgata), 'he who has arrived there, i.e. at emancipation,' may very easily have undergone the change into tathâgata, which would have made it unintelligible, were we not able to compare its unaltered form as preserved by the <i>G</i>ainas.</p>

Onîta, i.e. avanita, is not apanîta, and the end of the dinner was marked, not by the Bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by his washing the bowl (see <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 4, 6), and, of course, his hands.

The name Upatissa occurs in Asoka's well-known edict which has been found at Bairât. The king there quotes 'The Question of Upatissa' among the texts, the study of which he recommends to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity and to the laymen of either sex.

It is very difficult or rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction between â<i>k</i>ariyâ and upa<i>ggh</i>âya. The duties of an â<i>k</i>ariya towards his antevâsika, and of an antevâsika towards his â<i>k</i>ariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 ( = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 13, 14), are exactly the same as those of an upa<i>ggh</i>âya towards his saddhivihârika and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 11, 12). The position of an upa<i>ggh</i>âya, however, was considered as the more important of the two; at the upasampadâ service the upa<i>ggh</i>âya had a more prominent part than the â<i>k</i>ariya, as we may infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from the explanations on the 65th pâ<i>k</i>ittiya rule which are given in the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga. There it is said that, if the upasampadâ ordination had been conferred, against the rule, on a person that has not yet attained his twentieth year, the upa<i>ggh</i>âya has made himself guilty of a pâ<i>k</i>ittiya offence, the â<i>k</i>ariya and the other present Bhikkhus only of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. We may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Upâli down to Mahinda, which is given in the Dîpava<i>m</i>sa (Bhâ<i>n</i>avâras IV and V), is a succession of upa<i>ggh</i>âyas and saddhivihârikas (see IV, 36, 42, 43, &amp;c.), not of â<i>k</i>ariyas and antevâsikas; the duty of instructing the young Bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances seems, therefore, to belong to the upa<i>ggh</i>âya rather than to the â<i>k</i>ariya; compare also Dîpava<i>m</i>sa VII, 26. So among the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, on the contrary, the â<i>k</i>ârya is estimated higher than the upâdhyâya; see Manu II, 145; Yâ<i>gñ</i>avalkya I, 35. Compare also chap. 36. 1 (end of the paragraph), and Buddhaghosa's explanation of that passage.</p>

 <p><a name="page_203_note_1"></a><a href="#page_203_fr_1">1</a> The law alluded to is the 65th pâ<i>k</i>ittiya rule. Generally in the Khandhakas, which presuppose, as we have stated in our preface, the existence of the Pâtimokkha, direct repetition of the rules laid down there has been avoided. If, nevertheless, in the Khandhakas a transgression alluded to in the Pâtimokkha had to be mentioned again, then in most cases the Khandhakas, instead of directly indicating the penance incurred thereby, use of the guilty Bhikkhu the expression, 'yathâdhammo kâretabbo,' i.e. 'he is to be treated according to the law.' See H. O.'s Introduction to his edition of the Mahâvagga, p. xx note.</p>

This is, as far as we know, the only passage in the Pâli Pi<i>t</i>akas which mentions this lady, and it deserves notice that her name is not mentioned. Probably this name was unknown to the Buddhists in early times, and thus we may best account for the difference of the simply invented names given to this lady by later writers. Compare Rh.

Buddhaghosa (who of course never admits anything like an inadvertence of the holy Theras by whom the Vinaya is compiled) says that the third case and the tenth are distinguished here, because a person that has simply committed an impurity may receive the ordination, if he is willing to refrain himself in future; whilst a bhikkhunîdûsaka cannot be ordained in any case (see chap. 67).</p>
