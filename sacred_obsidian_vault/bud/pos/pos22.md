 VERSES ATTRIBUTED TO SISTERS IN THE BHIKKHUNĪ-SAŊYUTTA OF THE SAŊYUTTA-NIKĀYA</a></h2>
 
 
 <h3 align="center"><a name="A-1">1. Āḷavikā. </a><a href="pos22.htm#180-1"><sup>454</sup></a>
 </h3>
 
 
 <p>
 T<small>HUS</small> have I heard. The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Now Āḷavikā the Bhikkhunī dressed herself early and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for food. And when she had gone about Sāvatthī for it, had broken her fast and returned, she entered the Dark Wood, seeking solitude.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in her, desiring to make her desist from being alone, went up to her, and addressed her in a verse:
 </p>
 
 <table align="center">
 <tr><td>
 <b></b><p>
 'Ne'er shalt thou find escape while in the world. <br>
 What profiteth thee then thy loneliness?<br>
 Take the good things of life while yet thou may'st, <br>
 Repentance else too late awaiteth thee.'
 </p></td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>
 Then Āḷavikā thought: 'Who now is this, human or non-human, that speaketh this verse? Sure 'tis Māra the Evil One speaketh it, desirous to arouse in me fear, wavering and dread, desirous to make me desist from my solitude.' And Bhikkhunī Āḷavikā, knowing that 'twas he, replied with a verse:
 </p>
 
 <table align="center">
 <tr><td>
 <b></b><p>
 'There is escape while in the world, and I <br>
 Have well attained thereto by insight won. <br>
 Thou evil limb of loafing! <a href="pos22.htm#181-1"><sup>455</sup></a> 'tis not thine <br>
 To know that bourne, or how it may be reached. <br>
 Like spears and jav'lins are the joys of sense, <br>
 That pierce and rend the mortal frames of us. <br>
 These that thou callest "the good things of life," <br>
 Good of that ilk to me is nothing worth.'
 </p></td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>
 Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Āḷavikā knows me!' vanished thence, sad and dejected.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3 align="center"><a name="A-2">2. Somā. </a><a href="pos22.htm#181-2"><sup>456</sup></a>

 <p>
 . . . . . <a href="pos22.htm#181-3"><sup>457</sup></a> Now Somā . . . . . entered the Dark Wood for siesta, and, plunging into its depths, sat down at the root of a certain tree for siesta.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in her, desiring to make her desist from concentrated thought, went up to her, and addressed her in a verse:
 </p>
 
 <table align="center">

 <b></b><p>
 'That vantage-ground the sages may attain is hard <br>
 To reach. With her two-finger consciousness <br>
 That is no woman competent to gain!'
 </p></td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>
 Then Somā thought	. . . . .  'Sure 'tis Māra!'. . . . and replied with verses:
 </p>
 
 <table align="center">
 <tr><td>
 <b></b><p>
 'What should the woman's nature do to them <a href="pos22.htm#181-4"><sup>458</sup></a><br>
 Whose hearts are firmly set, who ever move<br>
 With growing knowledge onward in the Path?<br>
 What can that signify to one in whom <br>
 Insight doth truly comprehend the Norm? <br>
 To one for whom the question doth arise: <br>
 Am I a woman in these matters, or <br>
 Am I a man, or what not am I, then? <br>
 To such an one is Māra fit to talk!'
 </p></td></tr>

 <p>
 Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Somā knows me,' vanished thence, sad and dejected.

 I do not grieve, I am not shedding tears, <br>
 And as for thee, good sir, I fear thee not.<br>
 Slain everywhere is love of worldly joys, <br>
 And the thick gloom of ignorance is rent in twain. <br>
 Defeating all the army of the power of death, <br>
 I here abide purged of the poison-drugs.' <a href="pos22.htm#183-1"><sup>461</sup></a>

 the Dark Wood for siesta, and, plunging into its depths, halted at the root of a certain sāla-tree in full blossom.

 The Yakkha-Saŋyutta, or Fairy Series in the same Nikāya, gives the summons uttered by the indignant tree-fairy to the people of Rājagaha in Sukkā's little poem (<a href="pos08.htm#XXXIV">Ps. xxxiv</a>.).
