 PSALMS OF TWO VERSES </a></h2>

 B<small>ORN</small> in the time of the Buddha Vipassi, in his native town of Bandhumatī, as the daughter of a wealthy burgess, she became a pious lay-adherent, and at the Master's death she made an offering to the shrine of his ashes of a golden umbrella <a href="pos07.htm#22-1"><sup>117</sup></a> surrounded with jewels. Reborn for this in various heavens, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at Kapilavatthu as the daughter of the chief wife of Khemaka, the Sākiyan, and named Nandā. But because of her excessive beauty, charm, and loveliness, she was known as Nandā the Fair.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Now, on the day when she was to choose among her suitors,<a href="pos07.htm#22-2"><sup>118</sup></a> Carabhūta, her young Sākiyan kinsman, died. Then her parents made her leave the world against her will. But she, even after she had entered the Order, was infatuated with her own beauty, and, fearing the Master's rebuke, avoided his presence. Now the Exalted One knew that she was ripe for knowledge, and directed the Great Pajājatī to let all the Bhikkhunīs come to him for instruction. Nandā sent another in her place. And the Exalted One said, 'Let no one come by proxy.' So she was compelled to come. And the Exalted One, by his mystic power, conjured up a beautiful woman, and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandā. And he addressed her in these words:

But she reviled an Arahant Elder Sister by calling her a prostitute,<a href="pos07.htm#25-3"><sup>127</sup></a> and for this she went to purgatory. In this Buddha-dispensation she was
 reborn in the kingdom of Kāsī as the child of a distinguished and prosperous citizen. But because of the persistent effect of her former evil speech, she became herself a prostitute. How she left the world and was ordained by special messenger is related in the Culla Vagga. <a href="pos07.htm#26-1"><sup>128</sup></a> For she wished to go to Sāvatthī to be ordained by the Exalted One. But the libertines of Benares barred the ways, so she sent and asked the Exalted One's advice, and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger. Then she, working at insight, not long after obtained Arahantship, with thorough knowledge of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereupon she exclaimed:

 <p>
 And reflecting on what she had won, she expressed it in this psalm:

 <b></b><p><a name="37">
 Four times, nay, five, I sallied from my cell, <br>
 And roamed afield to find the peace of mind <br>
 I sought in vain, and governance of thoughts <br>
 I could not bring into captivity. </a><a href="pos07.htm#32-2"><sup>145</sup></a> (37)<br><a name="38">
 To me, even to me, on that eighth day <br>
 It came: all craving ousted from my heart. <br>
 'Mid many sore afflictions, I had wrought <br>
 With passionate endeavour, and had won! <br>
 Craving was dead, and the Lord's will was done. (38)</a>
