 <p>   <a name="pp_1"></a><font color="GREEN">1</font>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion, subsequent to his attainment of Buddhahood, the Blessed One dwelt at Uruvela, on the banks of the stream Neranjara at the foot of the Mucilinda tree.</p>
 
 <p>   At that time, the Blessed One, having sat in an attitude of meditation for seven days, experienced the bliss of Emancipation.</p>
 
 <p>   Now it came pass that a great cloud appeared, out of season, and for seven days rain fell, cold winds blew and darkness prevailed. And the Serpent King, Mucilinda, came forth from his hidden realm and winding his coils seven times around the body of the Blessed One, he formed with his serpent's hood a great canopy above the head of the Buddha, and he uttered these words to himself; "may no coldness touch the Blessed One, nor any heat, may no gadflies or gnats, or winds, or sunheat distress the Blessed One."</p>
 
 <p>   And the Blessed One, at the close of the seventh day arose from that state of trance and Mucilinda, the Serpent King, seeing that the sky was clear and cloudless, loosed his coils from around the body of the Blessed One and concealing his own nature, took upon him the form of a youth and stood before the Blessed One with folded hands,

 worshipping him. And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">

    Happy to be without malice! restraintful towards all beings!<br>

    To have removed the notion 'I am', that is the supreme joy!"<br></td></tr>

 <p>   <a name="pp_2"></a><font color="GREEN">2</font>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of Anâthapindika.</p>
 
 <p>   At that time a great number of Bhikkhus, when they had gone their rounds and finished the midday repast, assembled and fell into their places in the State room of the monastery. And a dispute arose to this effect; "Which, O Brothers, of the two Kings, the King Magadha Seniya Bimbasâra or the King Pasenadi Kosala, is the wealthiest, the possessor of the largest property, of treasure and chariots, which is the strongest, the most powerful, the most mighty?" Such were the dispute and contention which occupied these Bhikkhus at this time.</p>
 
 <p>   And the Blessed One, at even tide, arose from his solitary communings and went to the State room of the monastery and when he arrived there, he sat down on the appointed seat and while thus sitting, he called the Bhikkhus to him and said; "on what subject, O Bhikkhus, have dispute and contention arisen amongst you assembled and congregated here?"</p>

 <p>   Just now, Sire, when we had gone our rounds and finished the midday repast we assembled and fell into our places in the State room of the monastery and a dispute arose to this effect; [as above. <i>Translator</i>].</p>
 
 <p>   That, Sire, was the subject of dispute and contention among us, when the Blessed One arrived.</p>
 
 <p>   "It is not fitting, O Bhikkhus, for such as you, scions of noble families, who for the sake of the faith, have abandoned your homes for the homeless state, to engage in such disputes. When you assemble, O Bhikkhus, one of these two is obligatory, religious discourse or a noble silence."</p>
 
 <p>   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</p>

 <p>   At that time a number of youths, somewhere between Savatthi and the Jetavana, were attacking a snake with sticks. And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking with him his almsbowl and tunic, entered Savatthi to receive alms. And the Blessed One saw these youths, somewhere between Savatthi and the Jetavana, attacking a snake with sticks.</p>

At that time the Blessed One was respected, reverenced, held in awe and esteemed. He was a recipient of the requisites of a monk, such as robes, alms, bed and medicine in case of sickness. The Brotherhood also was respected, reverenced, honoured, held in awe and esteemed, and received the requisites of monks such as robes, alms, bed and medicine in case of sickness.</p>
 
 <p>   The wandering monks, however, adherents of heretical sects were not held in honour and were not recipients of the requisites of monks.</p>
 
 <p>   And these wandering monks, adherents of heretical sects could not endure the honour paid to the Blessed One and the Brotherhood, and whenever they saw the disciples of the Blessed One, in the villages or the woods, they abused, reviled, annoyed and worried them, making use of vile and harsh expressions.</p>
 
 <p>   And a large number of disciples went to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart and while thus sitting these disciples said to the Blessed One: "The Blessed One, Sire, is honoured, etc. [as above. <i>Transl</i>.]</p>

 <p>   <a name="pp_8"></a><font color="GREEN">8</font>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Kundi in the Kunditthâna Grove. Now at that time Suppavâsa, the daughter (of the King) of Koliya, had been in travail for seven days, after remaining childless for seven years. She, stricken with acute, piercing, terrible pains, found consolation in these three reflections;</p>
 
 <p>   "Surely, there is the Exalted One, the supreme Buddha who preaches the Doctrine whereby such pains as these are left behind."</p>
 
 <p>   "Surely, there are the disciples of the Exalted One, who walk in righteousness, who have entered the path where pains like these are left behind."</p>
 
 <p>   "O happy, too happy Nirvâna<a name="page_19_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_19_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, where pains like these will be no more!"</p>
 
 <p>   And Suppavâsa, the daughter (of the King) of Koliya called her husband and said; "Go, my Lord, to where the Exalted One tarries, and when you have drawn near to him, in my name bow down your head in salutation at the feet of the Exalted One, and ask if there is any slight ailment, if the Blessed One is free from bodily suffering and in vigorous health, and speak thus; "Suppavâsa, Sire, the daughter (of the King) of Koliya, bows her head in salutation at the feet of the Exalted One and asks if there is any slight ailment, if the Blessed One is free from bodily suffering, in vigorous health and in the enjoyment of life."</p>

 <p>   And say; "Suppavâsa, Sire, the daughter (of the King) of Koliya was childless for seven years and now has been in travail for seven days; she, stricken with acute, [as above] pains, finds consolation in these three reflections; [repetition as above. <i>Transl</i>.].</p>
 
 <p>   "Be it so;" said Koliyaputta, in assent to Suppavâsa the daughter of Koliya, and he went to where the Blessed One was and having saluted the Blessed One, he stood respectfully on one side and while thus standing he said to the Blessed One; "Suppavâsa, Sire, the daughter of Koliya bows her head. . . . [repetition as above. <i>Transl</i>.].</p>
 
 <p>   (And the Blessed One said); "Let it be well with Suppavâsa, the daughter of Koliya, let her bring forth in health a healthy son." (At the very moment the Blessed One spoke these words, it was well with Suppavâsa, the daughter of Koliya and she brought forth in health a healthy son).</p>
 
 <p>   "So be it, Sire," said Koliyaputta praising the words of the Blessed One and giving thanks. Then he arose from his seat and having saluted the Blessed One, passing round with his right side to him, he returned to his own house. And Koliyaputta saw that it was well with Suppavâsa and that she had brought forth a healthy son and when he beheld her, he thought to himself; "How marvellous, how wonderful is the great strength and mighty power of the Perfect One, that at the very moment the Blessed One spoke these words, it was well with Suppavâsa, and she brought forth in health a healthy son." And he was happy, gladdened and overjoyed.</p>
 
 <p>   And Suppavâsa cailed her husband and said; "Go, my Lord, to where the Blessed One is and drawing near to him,

May it please the Blessed One and the Brethren to take their meals with Suppavâsa the daughter of Koliya for seven days."</p>
 
 <p>   "Be it so," said Koliyaputta in assent to Suppavâsa and he went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near be saluted the Blessed One, and sat down respectfully apart, and while thus sitting he said to the Blessed One; "Suppavâsa, Sire, the daughter of Koliya bows her head . . . [as above. <i>Transl</i>.]. May it please the Blessed One and the Brethren to take their meals with her for seven days."</p>
 
 <p>   Now at that time, the Brotherhood with the Buddha at their head had been invited by a certain lay disciple to take their morrow's meal with him. And that lay disciple was the servitor of the venerable Maha Moggallana. And the Blessed One called the venerable Maha Moggallana to him and said; "Go thou, Moggalana, to where that disciple is and drawing near to him, say; "Friend, Suppavâsa, the daughter of Koliya who was childless for seven years . . . . [repetition. <i>Transl</i>.] has invited the Blessed One and the Brotherhood to take their meals with her for seven days. Permit Suppavâsa to provide these seven meals, afterwards you servitor shall provide the meal."</p>
 
 <p>   "Be it so, Sire," said the venerable Maha Moggalana in assent to the Blessed One and be went to where that lay disciple was and drawing near he said to him; "Suppavâsa, friend, . . . . [repetition. <i>Transl</i>.] has invited . . . . . . .

 [repetition. <i>Transl</i>.] . . . . . afterwards, you shall provide the meal." "If the lord Maha Moggalana will be my surety for three things, my property, my life and my faith, then let Suppavâsa the daughter of Koliya provide the seven meals, and afterwards I will provide the meal."</p>
 
 <p>   "For two of these things, friend, I will be your surety, for your property and your life, but you must be your own surety in respect of the faith."</p>
 
 <p>   If the Lord Maha Moggallana will be my surety for these two things, my property and my life, then let Suppavâsa provide the seven meals and afterwards I will provide the meal.</p>
 
 <p>   Then the venerable Maha Moggalana, having persuaded the lay disciple, went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near said to the Blessed One; "I have, Sire, persuaded the lay disciple to allow Suppavâsa to provide the seven meals and afterwards he will provide the meal."</p>
 
 <p>   Then Suppavâsa, the daughter of Koliya, for seven days with her own hands, made ready sweet food, both hard and soft and served it to the Brotherhood and the Buddha, as the principal guest. And she did homage to the child and to the Blessed One and the Brotherhood.</p>
 
 <p>   And the venerable Sariputta said to the child; "I trust, child, that you are at ease, that you have sufficient food to support life, that you do not suffer in any respect."</p>
 
 <p>   How, reverend Sariputta, can I be at ease, how can I be doing well, since I have been the cause of suffering to my mother for seven years?"</p>
 
 <p>   And Suppavâsa said to herself; "My son is conversing with the 'Captain<a name="page_22_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_22_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> of the Faith'." And she rejoiced exceedingly

 <p>   "I would have, Blessed One, seven other sons such as this one."</p>
