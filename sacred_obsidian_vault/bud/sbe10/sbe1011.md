 <p>p. 34</p> <h2 align="CENTER">Chapter IX.</h2> 
 <p align="CENTER">Evil.</p> 
 <p>   116. If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights in evil.</p> 
 <p>   117. If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.</p> 
 <p>   118. If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the outcome of good.</p> 
 <p>   119. Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see evil.</p> 
 <p>   120. Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see happy days.</p> 
 <p>   121. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by little.</p> 
 <p>   122. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little by little.</p> 
 <p>   123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions and carries much wealth,</p> 
 <p>p. 35</p> 
 <p>avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.</p> 
 <p>   124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand; poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil.</p> 
 <p>   125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.</p> 
 <p>   126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvâ<i>n</i>a.</p> 
 <p>   127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).</p> 
 <p>   128. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).</p> 
 <p>[125. Cf. <a href="sbe1035.htm#pp_661">Suttanipâta, v. 661</a>; Indische Sprüche, 1582; Kathâsaritsâgara, 49, 222.</p> 
 <p>126. For a description of hell and its long, yet not endless sufferings, see Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 132. The pleasures of heaven, too, are frequently described in these Parables and elsewhere. Buddha himself enjoyed these pleasures of heaven, before he was born for the last time. It is probably when good and evil deeds are equally balanced, that men are born again as human beings; this, at least, is the opinion of the <i>G</i>ainas. Cf. Chintâma<i>n</i>i, ed. H. Bower, Introd. p. xv.</p> 
 <p>127. Cf. <a href="../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:2">St. Luke xii. 2</a>, 'For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed;' and <a href="../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#89:8">Psalm cxxxix. 8-12</a>.]</p>
