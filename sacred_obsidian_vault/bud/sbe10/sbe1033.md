 <p></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER">2. DHANIYASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>A dialogue between the rich herdsman Dhaniya and Buddha, the one rejoicing in his worldly security and the other in his religious belief.--This beautiful dialogue calls to mind the parable in the <a href="../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:16">Gospel of S. Luke xii.16</a>.</blockquote> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. 'I have boiled (my) rice, I have milked (my cows),'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'I am living together with my fellows near the banks of the Mahî (river), (my) house is covered, the fire is kindled: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (18)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. 'I am free from anger, free from stubbornness,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I am abiding for one night near the banks of the Mahî (river), my house</p> 
 <p><a>p. 4</a></p> 
 <p>is uncovered, the fire (of passions) is extinguished: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (19)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. 'Gad-flies are not to be found (with me),'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'in meadows abounding with grass the cows are roaming, and they can endure rain when it comes: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (20)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. '(By me) is made a well-constructed raft,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I have passed over (to Nibbâna), I have reached the further bank, having overcome the torrent (of passions); there is no (further) use for a raft: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (21)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. 'My wife is obedient, not wanton,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'for a long time she has been living together (with me), she is winning, and I hear nothing wicked of her: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (22)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. 'My mind is obedient, delivered (from all worldliness),'--so said Bhagavat,--'it has for a long time been highly cultivated and well-subdued, there is no longer anything wicked in me: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (23)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. 'I support myself by my own earnings,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'and my children are (all) about me, healthy; I hear nothing wicked of them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (24)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. 'I am no one's servant,'--so said Bhagavat,--'with what I have gained I wander about in all the world, there is no need (for me) to serve: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (25)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. 'I have cows, I have calves,'-- so said the herdsman Dhaniya;--'I have cows in calf and heifers, and I have also a bull as lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (26)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 5</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. 'I have no cows, I have no calves,'--so said Bhagavat,--'I have no cows in calf and no heifers, and I have no bull as a lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky! (27)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. 'The stakes are driven in, and cannot be shaken,'--so said the herdsman Dhaniya,--'the ropes are made of mu<i>ñg</i>a grass, new and well-made, the cows will not be able to break them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (28)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. 'Having, like a bull, rent the bonds; having, like an elephant, broken through the galu<i>kkh</i>i creeper, I shall not again enter into a womb: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' (29)</p> 
 <p>   Then at once a shower poured down, filling both sea and land. Hearing the sky raining, Dhaniya spoke thus:</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. 'No small gain indeed (has accrued) to us since we have seen Bhagavat; we take refuge in thee, O (thou who art) endowed with the eye (of wisdom); be thou our master, O great Muni!' (30)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. 'Both my wife and myself are obedient; (if) we lead a holy life before Sugata, we shall conquer birth and death, and put an end to pain.' (31)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>15. 'He who has sons has delight in sons,'--so said the wicked Mâra,--'he who has cows has delight likewise in cows; for upadhi (substance) is the delight of man, but he who has no upadhi has no delight.' (32)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>16. 'He who has sons has care with (his) sons,'--so said Bhagavat,--'he who has cows has likewise care with (his) cows; for upadhi (is the cause of) people's cares, but he who has no upadhi has no care.' (33)</p>

KASIBHÂRADVÂ<i>G</i>ASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Brâhma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a reproaches Gotama with idleness, but the latter convinces him that he (Buddha) also works, and so the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is converted, and finally becomes a saint. Compare Sp. Hardy, A Manual of Buddhism, p. 214; <a href="../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#5:17">Gospel of S. John v. 17</a>.</blockquote> 
 <p>   So it was heard by me:</p> 
 <p>   At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Magadha at Dakkhi<i>n</i>âgiri in the Brâma<i>n</i>a village Ekana<i>l</i>â. And at that time the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a's five hundred</p>

 <p><a>p. 12</a></p> 
 <p>ploughs were tied (to the yokes) in the sowing season. Then Bhagavat, in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the place where the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a's work (was going on). At that time the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a's distribution of food took place. Then Bhagavat went to the place where the distribution of food took place, and having gone there, he stood apart. The Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a saw Bhagavat standing there to get alms, and having seen him, he said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
 <p>   'I, O Sama<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat; thou also, O Sama<i>n</i>a, shouldst plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, thou shouldst eat.'</p> 
 <p>   'I also, O Brâma<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p> 
 <p>   'Yet we do not see the yoke, or the plough, or the ploughshare, or the goad, or the oxen of the venerable Gotama.'</p> 
 <p>   And then the venerable Gotama spoke in this way:</p> 
 <p>   'I also, O Brâma<i>n</i>a, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p> 
 <p>   Then the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. 'Thou professest to be a ploughman, and yet we do not see thy ploughing; asked about (thy) ploughing, tell us (of it), that we may know thy ploughing.' (75)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. Bhagavat answered: 'Faith is the seed, penance the rain, understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad. (76)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. 'I am guarded in respect of the body, I am</p> 
 <p><a>p. 13</a></p> 
 <p>guarded in respect of speech, temperate in food; I make truth to cut away (weeds), tenderness is my deliverance. (77)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. 'Exertion is my beast of burden; carrying (me) to Nibbâna he goes without turning back to the place where having gone one does not grieve. (78)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. 'So this ploughing is ploughed, it bears the fruit of immortality; having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all pain.' (79)</p> 
 <p>   Then the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, having poured rice-milk into a golden bowl, offered it to Bhagavat, saying, 'Let the venerable Bhagavat eat of the rice-milk; the venerable is a ploughman, for the venerable Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality.'</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. Bhagavat said: 'What is acquired by reciting stanzas is not to be eaten by me; this is, O Brâma<i>n</i>a, not the Dhamma of those that see rightly; Buddha rejects what is acquired by reciting stanzas, this is the conduct (of Buddhas) as long as the Dhamma exists. (80)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. 'One who is an accomplished great Isi, whose passions are destroyed and whose misbehaviour has ceased, thou shouldst serve with other food and drink, for this is the field for one who looks for good works<sup>[1]</sup>.' (81)</p> 
 <p>   'To whom then, O Gotama, shall I give this rice-milk?' so said Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a.</p> 
 <p>   'I do not see, O Brâma<i>n</i>a, in the world (of men)</p>

 <p>and gods and Mâras and Brahmans, amongst beings comprising gods and men, and Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâma<i>n</i>as, any by whom this rice-milk when eaten can be properly digested with the exception of Tathâgata, or a disciple of Tathâgata. Therefore, O Brâma<i>n</i>a, thou shalt throw this rice-milk in (a place where there is) little grass, or cast it into water with no worms: so said Bhagavat.</p> 
 <p>   Then the Brâma<i>n</i>a Kasibhâradvâ<i>g</i>a threw the rice-milk into some water with no worms. Then the rice-milk thrown into the water splashed, hissed, smoked in volumes; for as a ploughshare that has got hot during the day when thrown into the water splashes, hisses, and smokes in volumes, even so the rice-milk (when) thrown into the water splashed, hissed, and smoked in volumes.</p>

 <p>   <a></a>25. 'He who has got a great name, sees what is subtile, imparts understanding; and does not cling to the abode of sensual pleasures, behold him, the all-knowing, the wise, the great Isi, walking in the noble path. (176)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>26. 'A good sight indeed (has met) us to-day, a good daybreak, a beautiful rising, (for) we have seen the perfectly enlightened (sambuddham), who has crossed the stream, and is free from passion. (177)</p>

 <p></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER">10. Â<i>L</i>AVAKASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka first threatens Buddha, then puts some questions to him which Buddha answers, whereupon Â<i>l</i>avaka is converted.</blockquote> 
 <p>   So it was heard by me:</p> 
 <p>   At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Â<i>l</i>avî, in the realm of the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka. Then the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka went to the place where Bhagavat dwelt, and having gone there he said this to Bhagavat:</p> 
 <p>   'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
 <p>   'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
 <p>   A second time the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
 <p>   'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
 <p>   A third time the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka said this Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   ' Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p> 
 <p>   'Enter, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>[1. Dhammassa <i>k</i>a sudhammatam.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 30</a></p> 
 <p>   'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p> 
 <p>   A fourth time the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka said this to Bhagavat: 'Come out, O Sama<i>n</i>a!'</p> 
 <p>   'I shall not come out to thee, O friend, do what thou pleasest.'</p> 
 <p>   'I shall ask thee a question, O Sama<i>n</i>a, if thou canst not answer it, I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by thy feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>gâ.'</p> 
 <p>   'I do not see, O friend, any one in this world nor in the world of gods, Mâras, Brahmans, amongst the beings comprising gods, men, Sama<i>n</i>as, and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>gâ; however, O friend, ask what thou pleasest.'</p> 
 <p>   Then the Yakkha Â<i>l</i>avaka addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. 'What in this world is the best property for a man? what, being well done, conveys happiness? what is indeed the sweetest of sweet things? how lived do they call life the best?' (180)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. Bhagavat said: 'Faith is in this world the best property for a man; Dhamma, well observed, conveys happiness; truth indeed is the sweetest of things; and that life they call the best which is lived with understanding.' (181)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. Â<i>l</i>avaka said: 'How does one cross the stream (of existence)? how does one cross the sea? how does one conquer pain? how is one purified?' (182)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. Bhagavat said: 'By faith one crosses the stream, by zeal the sea, by exertion one conquers pain, by understanding one is purified.' (183)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 31</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. Â<i>l</i>avaka said: 'How does one obtain understanding? how does one acquire wealth? how does one obtain fame? how does one bind friends (to himself)? how does one not grieve passing away from this world to the other?' (184)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. Bhagavat said: 'He who believes in the Dhamma of the venerable ones as to the acquisition of Nibbâna, will obtain understanding from his desire to hear, being zealous and discerning. (185)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. 'He who does what is proper, who takes the yoke (upon him and) exerts himself, will acquire wealth, by truth he will obtain fame, and being charitable he will bind friends (to himself). (186)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. 'He who is faithful and leads the life of a householder, and possesses the following four Dhammas (virtues), truth, justice (dhamma), firmness, and liberality,--such a one indeed does not grieve when passing away. (187)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. 'Pray, ask also other Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as far and wide, whether there is found in this world anything greater than truth, self-restraint, liberality, and forbearance.' (188)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. Â<i>l</i>avaka said: 'Why should I now ask Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as far and wide? I now know what is my future good. (189)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. 'For my good Buddha came to live at Â<i>l</i>avî; now I know where (i.e. on whom bestowed) a gift will bear great fruit. (190)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. 'I will wander about from village to village, from town to town, worshipping the perfectly enlightened (sambuddha) and the perfection of the Dhamma.' (191)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>1. If either walking or standing, sitting or lying, any one contracts (or) stretches (his body, then) this is the motion of the body. (192)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. The body which is put together with bones and sinews, plastered with membrane and flesh, and covered with skin, is not seen as it really is. (193)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. It is filled with the intestines, the stomach, the lump of the liver, the abdomen, the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, the spleen. (194)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. With mucus, saliva, perspiration, lymph, blood, the fluid that lubricates the joints, bile, and fat. (195)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. Then in nine streams impurity flows always from it; from the eye the eye-excrement, from the ear the ear-excrement, (196)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. Mucus from the nose, through the mouth it ejects at one time bile and (at other times) it ejects phlegm, and from (all) the body come sweat and dirt. (197)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. Then its hollow head is filled with the brain. A fool led by ignorance thinks it a fine thing. (198)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. And when it lies dead, swollen and livid, discarded in the cemetery, relatives do not care (for it). (199)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. Dogs eat it and jackals, wolves and worms; crows and vultures eat it, and what other living creatures there are. (200)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. The Bhikkhu possessed of understanding in this world, having listened to Buddha's words, he</p> 
 <p><a>p. 33</a></p> 
 <p>certainly knows it (i.e. the body) thoroughly, for he sees it as it really is. (201)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. "As this (living body is) so is that (dead one), as this is so that (will be<sup>[1]</sup>); let one put away desire for the body, both as to its interior and as to its exterior." (202)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. Such a Bhikkhu who has turned away from desire and attachment, and is possessed of understanding in this world, has (already) gone to the immortal peace, the unchangeable state of Nibbâna. (203)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. This (body) with two feet is cherished (although) impure, ill-smelling, filled with various kinds of stench, and trickling here and there. (204)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. He who with such a body thinks to exalt himself or despises others--what else (is this) but blindness? (205)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>13. The man who, having penetrated the world, sees the highest truth, such a one, after crossing the stream and sea (of existence), who has cut off all ties, is independent, free from passion, him indeed the wise style a Muni. (218)</p>
