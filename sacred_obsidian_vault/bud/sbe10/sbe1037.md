 <p></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER"><a>1.</a> VATTHUGÂTHÂ.</h2> <blockquote>To the Brâhma<i>n</i>a Bâvarî, living on the banks of the Godhâvarî, in Assaka's territory, comes another Brâhma<i>n</i>a and asks for five hundred pieces of money, but not getting them he curses Bâvarî, saying, 'May thy head on the seventh day hence cleave into seven.' A deity comforts Bâvarî by referring him to Buddha. Then Bâvarî sends his sixteen disciples to Buddha, and each of thern asks Buddha a question.</blockquote> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. From the beautiful city of the Kosalas (Sâvatthî) a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, well versed in the hymns, went to the South (Dakkhi<i>n</i>âpatha) wishing for nothingness<sup>[1]</sup>. (976)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. In Assaka's territory, in the neighbourhood of A<i>l</i>aka, he dwelt on the banks of the Godhâvarî, (living) on gleanings and fruit. (977)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. And close by the bank there was a large village, with the income of which he prepared a great sacrifice. (978)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. Having offered the great sacrifice, he again entered the hermitage. Upon his re-entering, another Brâhma<i>n</i>a arrived, (979)</p> 
 <p>   5. With swollen feet<sup>[2]</sup>, trembling, covered with mud, with dust on his head. And he going up</p>

 <p><a>p. 185</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>to him (i.e. the first Brâhma<i>n</i>a) demanded five hundred (pieces of money). (980)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. Bâvarî, seeing him, bade him be seated, asked him whether he was happy and well, and spoke as follows: (981)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. 'What gifts I had are all given away by me; pardon me, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, I have no five hundred.' (982)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. 'If thou wilt not give to me who asks, may thy head on the seventh clay cleave into seven.' (983)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. So after the usual ceremonies this impostor made known his fearful (curse). On hearing these his words Bâvarî became sorrowful. (984)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. He wasted away taking no food, transfixed by the arrow of grief, but yet his mind delighted in meditation. (985)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. Seeing Bâvarî struck with horror and sorrowful, the benevolent deity (of that place) approached him and said as follows: (986)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. 'He does not know (anything about) the head; he is a hypocrite coveting riches; knowledge of the head and head-splitting is not found in him<sup>[1]</sup>.' (987)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. 'If the venerable (deity) knows it, then tell me, when asked, all about the head and head-splitting; let us hear thy words.' (988)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. 'I do not know this; knowledge of it is not found in me; as to the head and head-splitting, this is to be seen by Buddhas (only).' (989)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>15. 'Who then, say, in the circumference of the</p> 
 <p>[1. Na so muddha<i>m</i> pa<i>g</i>ânâti,<br>      Kuhako so dhanatthiko,<br>      Muddhani muddhapâte <i>k</i>a<br>      <i>Ñ</i>â<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> tassa na vi<i>gg</i>ati.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 186</a></p> 
 <p>earth knows the head and head-splitting, tell me that, O deity?' (990)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>16. 'Formerly went out from Kapilavatthu a ruler of the world, an offspring of the Okkâka king, the Sakya son, the light-giving; (991)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>17. 'He is, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the perfectly Enlightened (Sambuddha); perfect in all things, he has attained the power of all knowledge, sees clearly in everything; he has arrived at the destruction of all things, and is liberated in the destruction of the upadhis<sup>[1]</sup>. (992)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>18. 'He is Buddha, he is Bhagavat in the world, he, the clearly-seeing, teaches the Dhamma; go thou to him and ask, he will explain it to thee.' (993)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>19. Having heard the word 'Sambuddha,' Bâvarî rejoiced, his grief became little, and he was filled with great delight. (994)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>20. Bâvarî glad, rejoicing, and eager asked the deity: 'In what village or in what town or in what province dwells the chief of the world, that going there we may adore the perfectly Enlightened, the first of men?' (995)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>21. 'In Sâvatthî, the town of the Kosalas, dwells <i>G</i>ina (the Victorious), of great understanding and excellent wide knowledge, he the Sakya son, unyoked, free from passion, skilled in head-splitting, the bull of men.' (996)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>22. Then (Bâvarî) addressed his disciples, Brâhma<i>n</i>as, perfect in the hymns: 'Come, youths, I will tell (you something), listen to my words: (997)</p> 
 <p>   23. 'He whose appearance in the world is difficult to be met with often, he is at the present time<sup>[2]</sup></p> [1. Sabbadhammakkhaya<i>m</i> patto (i.e. nibbâna)<br>      Vimutto upadhisa<i>m</i>khaye. 
 <p>2. Sv-â<i>gg</i>a.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 187</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>born in the world and widely renowned as Sambuddha (the perfectly Enlightened); go quickly to Sâvatthî and behold the best of men.' (998)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>24. 'How then can we know, on seeing him, that he is Buddha, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a? Tell us who do not know him, by what may we recognise him? (999)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>25. 'For in the hymns are to be found the marks of a great man, and thirty-two are disclosed altogether, one by one.' (1000)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>26. 'For him on whose limbs these marks of a great man are to be found, there are two ways left, a third does not exist. (1001)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>27. 'If he abides in a dwelling, he will subdue this earth without rod (or) sword, he will rule with justice. (1002)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>28. 'And if he departs from his dwelling for the wilderness, he becomes the saint, incomparable Sambuddha, who has removed the veil (from the world)<sup>[1]</sup>. (1003)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>29. 'Ask in your mind about my birth and family, my marks, hymns, and my other disciples, the head and head-splitting. (1004)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>30. 'If he is Buddha, the clear-sighted, then he will answer by word of mouth the questions you have asked in your mind.' (1005)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a><a></a><a></a>31, 32, 33. Having heard Bâvarî's words his disciples, sixteen Brâhma<i>n</i>as, A<i>g</i>ita, Tissametteyya, Pu<i>nn</i>aka, further Mettagû, Dhotaka and Upasîva, and Nanda, further Hemaka, the two Todeyya and Kappa, and the wise <i>G</i>atuka<i>nn</i>î, Bhadrâvudha and Udaya, and also the Brâhma<i>n</i>a Posâla, and the wise Mogharâ<i>g</i>an, and the great Isi Pi<u>n</u>giya, (1006-1008)</p> 
 <p><a></a>34. All of them, having each their host (of pupils),</p> 
 <p>[1. Comp. Lalita-vistara (ed. Calc.), pp. 116, 118.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 188</a></p> 
 <p>and being themselves widely renowned throughout the world, thinkers delighting in meditation, wise, scented with the perfume of former (good deeds)<sup>[1]</sup>, (1009)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>35. Having saluted Bâvarî and gone round him towards the right, all with matted hair and bearing hides, departed with their faces turned to the north. (1010)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>36. To Pati<i>tth</i>âna of A<i>l</i>aka first, then to Mâhissatî, and also to U<i>gg</i>enî, Gonaddha, Vedisâ, Vanasavhaya, (1011)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>37. And also to Kosambî, Sâketa, and Sâvatthî, the most excellent of cities, to Setavya, Kapilavatthu, and the city of Kusinâra, (1012)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>38. And to Pâva, the city of wealth, to Vesâlî, the city of Magadha, to Pâsâ<i>n</i>aka <i>K</i>etiya (the Rock Temple), the lovely, the charming. (1013)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>39. As he who is athirst (longs for) the cold water, as the merchant (longs for) gain, as he who is plagued by heat (longs for) shade, so in haste they ascended the mountain. (1014)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>40. And Bhagavat at that time attended by the assembly of the Bhikkhus taught the Dhamma to the Bhikkhus, and roared like a lion in the forest. (1015)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>41. A<i>g</i>ita beheld Sambuddha as the shining (sun) without (burning) rays, as the moon on the fifteenth, having reached her plenitude. (1016)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>42. Then observing his limbs and all the marks in their fulness, standing apart, rejoiced, he asked the questions of his mind:-- (1017)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>43. 'Tell me about (my master's) birth, tell me about his family together with the marks, tell me about his perfection in the hymns, how many (hymns) does the Brâhma<i>n</i>a recite?' (1018)</p> 
 <p>[1. Pubbavâsanavâsitâ.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 189</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>44. Bhagavat said: 'One hundred and twenty years (is his) age, and by family he is a Bâvarî; three are his marks on the limbs, and in the three Vedas he is perfect. (1019)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>45. 'In the marks and in the Itihâsa together with Nigha<i>nd</i>u and Ke<i>t</i>ubha--he recites five hundred--and in his own Dhamma he has reached perfection.' (1020)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>46. A<i>g</i>ita thought: 'Explain fully the marks of Bâvarî, O thou best of men, who cuts off desire; let there be no doubt left for us.' (1021)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>47. Bhagavat said: 'He covers his face with his tongue, he has a circle of hair between the eye-brows, (his) privy member (is) hidden in a sheath, know this, O young man<sup>[1]</sup>.' (1022)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>48. Not hearing him ask anything, but hearing the questions answered, the multitude reflected overjoyed and with joined hands:-- (1023)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>49. 'Who, be he a god, or Brahman, or Inda, the husband of Su<i>g</i>â, asked in his mind those questions, and to whom did that (speech) reply?' (1024)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>50. A<i>g</i>ita said: 'The head and head-splitting Bâvarî asked about; explain that, O Bhagavat, remove our doubt, O Isi.' (1025)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>51. Bhagavat said: 'Ignorance is the head, know this; knowledge cleaves the head, together with belief, thoughtfulness, meditation, determination, and strength.' (1026)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>52. Then with great joy having composed himself the young man put his hide on one shoulder,</p> 
 <p>[1. Mukha<i>m</i> <i>g</i>ivhâya <i>kh</i>âdeti,<br>      U<i>nn</i>' assa bhamukantare,<br>      Kosohita<i>m</i> vatthaguyha<i>m</i>,<br>      Eva<i>m</i> <i>g</i>ânâhi mâ<i>n</i>ava.]</p> 
 <p><a>p. 190</a></p> 
 <p>fell at (Bhagavat's) feet (and saluted him) with his head, (saying): (1027)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>53. 'Bâvarî, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, together with his disciples, O thou venerable man, delighted and glad, does homage to thy feet, O thou clearly-seeing.' (1028)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>54. Bhagavat said: 'Let Bâvarî, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, be glad together with his disciples! Be thou also glad, live long, O young man! (1029)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>55. 'For Bâvarî and for thee, for all there are all (kinds of) doubt; having got an opportunity, ask ye whatever you wish.' (1030)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>56. After getting permission from Sambuddha, A<i>g</i>ita sitting there with folded hands asked Tathâgata the first question. (1031)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>2. 'With ignorance is the world shrouded, O A<i>g</i>ita,'--so said Bhagavat,--'by reason of avarice it does not shine; desire I call its pollution, pain is its great danger.' (1033)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. 'The streams of desire flow in every direction,'--so said the venerable A<i>g</i>ita;--'what dams the streams, say what restrains the streams, by what may the streams be shut off<sup>[1]</sup>?' (1034)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>5. 'Both understanding and thoughtfulness,'--so said the venerable A<i>g</i>ita,--'and name and shape<sup>[1]</sup>, O venerable man,--asked about this by me, declare by what is this stopped? ' (1036)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. Buddha: 'This question which thou hast asked, O A<i>g</i>ita, that I will explain to thee; (I will explain to thee) by what name and shape<sup>[2]</sup> are totally stopped; by the cessation of consciousness this is stopped here.' (1037)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. A<i>g</i>ita: 'Those who have examined (all) Dhammas (i.e. the saints), and those who are disciples, (and those who are) common men here,--when thou art asked about their mode of life, declare it unto me, thou who art wise, O venerable man.' (1038)</p>

(about this) I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this.' (1042)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. 'All these Isis and men, Khattiyas and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, O Pu<i>nn</i>aka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'who offered sacrifices to the gods abundantly in this world, offered sacrifices, O Pu<i>nn</i>aka, after reaching old age, wishing for their present condition.' (1043)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. 'All these Isis and men, Khattiyas and Brâhma<i>n</i>as,'--so said the venerable Pu<i>nn</i>aka,--'who offered sacrifices to the gods abundantly in this world, did they, O Bhagavat, indefatigable in the way of offering, cross over both birth and old age, O venerable man?

 <p>'I will explain that to thee in the way I myself know it: originating in the upadhis pains arise, whatsoever they are, of many kinds in the world. (1049)</p>

 <p>further shore, and therefore this order of Dhamma was called 'the way to the other shore.'</p>

A<i>g</i>ita, Tissametteyya, Pu<i>nn</i>aka and Mettagû, Dhotaka and Upasîva, Nanda and Hemaka, the two Todeyya and Kappa, and the wise <i>G</i>atuka<i>nn</i>in, Bhadrâvudha and Udaya, and also the Brâhma<i>n</i>a Posâla, and the wise Mogharâ<i>g</i>an, and Pi<u>n</u>giya the great Isi, (1123, 1124)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. These went up to Buddha, the Isi of exemplary conduct; asking subtle questions they went up to the supreme Buddha. (1125)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. Buddha, being asked, responded to their questions truly, and in responding to the questions the Muni delighted the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.(1126)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. They, having been delighted by the clearly-seeing Buddha, the kinsman of the Âdi<i>kk</i>as, devoted themselves to a religious life near the man of excellent understanding. (1127)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. He who lived according to what had been taught by Buddha (in answer) to each single question, went from this shore to the other shore. (1128)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. From this shore he went to the other shore entering upon the most excellent way; this way is to lead to the other shore, therefore it is called 'the way to the other shore.' (1129)</p> 
 <p></p><hr> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. 'I will proclaim accordingly the way to the further shore,'--so said the venerable Pi<u>n</u>giya;--'as he saw it, so he told it; the spotless, the very wise, the passionless, the desireless lord, for what reason should he speak falsely? (1130)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. 'Well! I will praise the beautiful voice of (Buddha), who is without stain and folly, and who has left behind arrogance and hypocrisy. (1131)</p>

 <p>who thoroughly understands the world<sup>[1]</sup>, has overcome all existences, is free from passion, has left behind all pain, is rightly called (Buddha), he, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, has come to me. (1132)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>12. 'Those who before in another world explained the doctrine of Gotama, saying, "So it was, so it will be," all that was only oral tradition, all that was only something that increased my doubts<sup>[3]</sup>. (1134)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. 'There is only one abiding dispelling darkness, that is the high-born, the luminous, Gotama of great understanding, Gotama of great wisdom, (1135)</p>

 <p>2. At the conclusion of this (i.e. the preceding) gâthâ, Bhagavat, who stayed at Sâvatthî, when seeing the maturity of the minds of Pi<u>n</u>giya and Bâvarî, shed a golden light. Pi<u>n</u>giya, who sat picturing Buddha's virtues to Bâvarî, having seen the light, looked round, saying, 'What is this?' And when he saw Bhagavat standing, as it were, before him, he said to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a Bâvarî: 'Buddha has come.' The Brâhma<i>n</i>a rose from his seat and stood with folded hands. Bhagavat, shedding a light, showed himself to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and knowing what was beneficial for both, he said this stanza while addressing Pi<u>n</u>giya. Commentator.]</p>
