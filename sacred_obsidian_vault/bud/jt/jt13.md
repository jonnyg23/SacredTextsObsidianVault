 <p>ONCE upon a time a king had an Elephant named Girly-face. The Elephant was called Girly-face because he was so gentle and good and looked so kind. "Girly-face never hurts anybody," the keeper of the Elephants often said.</p> 
 <p>Now one night some robbers came into the courtyard and sat on the ground just outside the stall where Girly-face slept. The talk of the robbers awoke Girly-face.</p>

 <p>"This is the way to break into a house," they said. "Once inside the house kill any one who wakens. A robber must not be afraid to kill. A robber must be cruel and have no pity. He must never be good, even for a moment."</p> 
 <p>Girly-face said to himself, "Those men are teaching me how I should act. I will be cruel. I will show no pity. I will not be good--not even for a moment."</p> 
 <p>So the next morning when the keeper came to feed Girly-face he picked him up in his trunk and threw the poor keeper to the ground, killing him.</p>

 <p>Another keeper ran to see what the trouble was, and Girly-face killed him, too.</p> 
 <p>For days and days Girly-face was so ugly that no one dared go near. The food was left for him, but no man would go near him.</p> 
 <p>By and by the king heard of this and sent one of his wise men to find out what ailed Girly-face.</p> 
 <p>The wise man had known Girly-face a long time. He looked the Elephant over carefully and could find nothing that seemed to be the matter.</p>

 <p>He thought at last, "Girly-face must have heard some bad men talking. Have there been any bad men talking about here?" asked the wise man.</p> 
 <p>"Yes," one of the keepers said, "a band of robbers were caught here a few weeks ago. They had met in the yard to talk over their plans. They were talking together near the stall where Girly-face sleeps."</p> 
 <p>So the wise man went back to the king. Said he, "I think Girly-face has been listening to bad talk. If you will send some good men to talk where Girly-face can hear them I think he will be a good Elephant once more."</p> 
 <p>So that night the king sent a company of the best men to be found to sit and talk near the stall where Girly-face lived. They said to one another, "It is wrong to hurt any one. It is wrong to kill. Every one should be gentle and good."</p> 
 <p>"Now those men are teaching me," thought Girly-face. "I must be gentle and good. I must hurt no one. I must not kill any one." And from that time on Girly-face was tame and as good as ever an Elephant could be. </p>
