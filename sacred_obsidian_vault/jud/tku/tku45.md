 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">CONCERNING THE THIRD PART OF THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.</h3>
 <p>867. "ALSO we have learned, Bearing iniquity is this second conformation called, like as in the Holy Ancient One.</p>
 <p>868. "But because that path which goeth forth in the third disposition beneath the two nostrils is filled with short and rigid hairs; hence because of that path these conformations are not called 'bearing iniquity and passing over <a href="errata.htm#7">transgression</a>;' but these are collected together in another place.</p>
 <p>869. "Also we have learned in Barietha that three hundred and seventy-five mercies are comprehended in the benignity of the Ancient of Days; which are all called primal benignities.</p>
 <p>870. "Like as it is said, Psalm lxxxix. 50: 'Where are thy former mercies?' And they are all comprehended in the benignity of the Most Holy Ancient One, the most concealed of all.</p>
 <p>871. "But the benignity of Microprosopus is called ChSD OVLM, <i>Chesed Olahm</i>, the benignity of time.</p>
 <p>872. "And in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery' (<i>have we learned</i>) that on account of the former benignity of the Ancient of Days is he called 'Abundant in Benignity.' But in Microprosopus (<i>the word</i>) 'mercy' is placed alone and absolutely.</p>
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a></p>
 <p>873. "And therefore is it here written: 'And abundant in benignity;' and again it is written: 'Keeping mercy for thousands;' plain and without addition.</p>
 <p>874. "And now we have taught concerning this Name, 'And abundant in benignity,' because therefrom is mitigated the (<i>interior</i>) benignity, so that it may shine into all the lights (otherwise, this Name, 'Abundant in mercy,' stretcheth down even unto the 'mercy' which is so called absolutely, so that it may illuminate it, and kindle the lights).</p>
 <p>875. "For we have learned that that path which descendeth beneath the two nostrils of the nose is filled with short hairs; and concerning this path, that it is written: 'Passing over transgression' (otherwise, and the shorter hairs fill that path. But that path is not called 'Passing over transgression'); because there is therein no occasion for passing over; for a double reason.</p>
 <p>876. "Firstly, because that path is a hard place for passing over. (Otherwise, because the hairs which are found therein are hard.)</p>
 <p>877. "Secondly, because the passing over of that path descendeth even unto the commencement of the mouth.</p>
 <p>878. "But concerning this it is written, Cant. v. 13: 'His lips like roses <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">1</font></a> (that is, red as roses), dropping sweet-smelling myrrh while passing over;' which denoteth notable redness.</p>
 <p>879. "And this path of that place is a duplex form, and is not mitigated, whence he who wisheth to threaten toucheth that path twice with his hand."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_153"></a><a href="tku45.htm#fr_154">220:1</a> The English version of this passage readers it, "His lips like lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh." The word here translated roses by Knorr de Rosenroth is ShVShNIM, <i>Shoshanim</i>, which I think should undoubtedly be translated "lilies," as in the ordinary version. The symbology of this chapter is very difficult and obscure.</p>
