 <h3 align="CENTER">CONCERNING THE BEARD OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT ONE.</h3>
 <p>150. From the Beard of the Most Holy Ancient One hangeth the whole ornament of all, and the Influence; for all things are called from that beard, Influence.</p>
 <p>151. This is the Ornament of all Ornaments, and this influence do all the superiors and inferiors alike behold.</p>
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p>
 <p>152. From this Influence dependeth the life of all things.</p>
 <p>153, From this Influence heavens and earth depend, the rains of grace, and the nourishment of all things.</p>
 <p>154. From this Influence cometh the providence of all things. From this Influence depend all the superior and inferior hosts.</p>
 <p>155. Thirteen fountains of excellent and precious oil depend from this beard of most glorious Influence, and they all flow down into Microprosopus.</p>
 <p>156. Say not thou, however, that all do so, but nine of them are found (<i>in Microprosopus</i>) for the purpose of diverting the judgments.</p>
 <p>157. And whensoever this Influence hangeth down in equilibrium even unto the heart, all the Holinesses of the Holinesses of Holiness depend from it.</p>
 <p>158. In that Influence is extended an expansion of the Supernal Emanation, <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is the Head of all Heads, which is not known nor perfected, and which neither superiors nor inferiors have known, because from that Influence all things depend.</p>
 <p>159. In this beard the Three Heads concerning which we have spoken are expanded, and all things are associated together in this Influence, and are found therein.</p>
 <p>160. And therefore every ornament of ornaments dependeth from that Influence.</p>
 <p>161. Those letters which depend from this Ancient One all hang in that beard, and are associated together in that Influence.</p>
 <p>162. And they hang therein for the purpose of establishing the other letters.</p>
 <p>163. For unless those letters could ascend into the Ancient One, those other letters could not be established.</p>
 <p>164. And therefore Moses saith when necessary IHVH,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> IHVH, twice; and so that an accent distinguishes the one from the other.</p>
 <p>165. For assuredly from the Influence all things depend.</p>
 <p>166. By that Influence are both superiors and inferiors brought into reverence, and are prostrate before It.</p>
 <p>167. Blessed is he who attaineth hereunto.</p>
