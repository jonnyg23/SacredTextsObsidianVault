 <h3 align="CENTER">CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.</h3>
 <p>661. WE have learned it in the "Book of Concealed Mystery." The nose of Microprosopus. From the nose is the countenance known. In this nose is diverse symbolism.</p>
 <p>662. For it is written, Ps. xviii. 8: "There went up</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>
 <p>a smoke out of His nose, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a> and fire out of His mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it."</p>
 <p>663. "There went up a smoke out of His nose." In this smoke are included both the fire and the burning coals; for there is no smoke without fire, neither fire without smoke. Truly all things result (<i>herefrom</i>: otherwise, are kindled <i>herein</i>) and go forth from His nose.</p>
 <p>664. Also we have learned that when these three things are associated together which are included in that smoke which issueth from the nose, the nose <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">2</font></a> is lengthened.</p>
 <p>665. And therein are two colours, for the smoke bloweth and rusheth forth black and red; and they call it AP, <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>Aph</i>, wrath; and ChIMH, <i>Chimah</i>, fervour; and MShChITh, <i>Meshachith</i>, perdition.</p>
 <p>666. And if thou sayest wrath and fervour, it is well, since it is written, Deut. ix. 19: "Since I have feared because of wrath and fervour." For these are the black and red smoke. But whence is added MShChITh, <i>Meshachith</i>, perdition?</p>
 <p>667. Because it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: "Before that Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah." But the word ShChTh, <i>Shachith</i>, denoted perdition brought about by burning, kindled fire.</p>
 <p>668. Also we have learned that there are five <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">4</font></a> GBVRAN, Geboran, severities in this conformation of Microprosopus, and they ascend in one thousand and four hundred severities, GBVRAN; and they are extended in</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> His nose, and in His mouth, and in His arms, and in His hands, and in His fingers.</p>
 <p>669. And therefore is it written, Ps. cvi. 2: "Who can declare the GBVRVTh, <i>Geburoth</i>, powers of Tetragrammaton?"</p>
 <p>670. Hence it is written, "powers" Geburoth (<i>in the plural number</i>); and it is written, 1 Chron. xxix. ii: "Thine! O Tetragrammaton, are Gedulah and Geburah," <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the singular (<i>number</i>).</p>
 <p>671. Assuredly thus have we learned. When all those severities are amalgamated into one, then are they called one Geburah, GBVRH.</p>
 <p>672. And all those powers, Geboran, commence to descend from the nose. And from it depend a thousand times a thousand and four hundred myriads in their single (<i>form</i>). <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>673. And from that smoke which issueth from his nose depend a thousand times a thousand myriads, and four hundred and five which belong to this (<i>idea of</i>) Severity. <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">3</font></a> For all the severities depend from this nose.</p>
 <p>674. For it is written, Ps. cxlv. 4: "From generation unto generation shall they praise thy works, and announce thy GBVRVTh, <i>Geburoth</i>."</p>
 <p>675. And when that GBVRH, <i>Geburah</i>, Strength, commenceth (<i>to be manifested</i>), all the severities radiate thence, and are sharpened, until they descend in the form of a swift, whirling fire-flaming sword (Gen. iii. 24.)</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>
 <p>676. It is written, Gen. xix. 13: "For we will destroy this place." Also it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: "Before that Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah?" And again, Gen. xix. 24: "Tetragrammaton rained upon Sodom and <a href="errata.htm#5">Gomorrah</a>."</p>
 <p>677. Assuredly thus have we learned: There is no judge over the wicked, but they themselves convert the measure of Mercy into a measure of judgment.</p>
 <p>678. But how do they convert it thus? Also it is written, Mal. iii. 6: "I, Tetragrammaton, change not."</p>
 <p>679. Assuredly as many times as the Ancient of the Ancient Ones and that White Head uncovereth the benevolence of benevolences, great mercies are found everywhere.</p>
 <p>680. But when that is not uncovered, all the judgments of Microprosopus are prepared; and in this manner, if it be permitted us to say so, Mercy becometh judgment; that is, the most Ancient One of all.</p>
 <p>681. We have learned in Barietha <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>: "When the Ancient of the Ancient Ones uncovereth the benevolence of benevolences, all those lights which are called by a similar name shine, and Mercy is found in all things."</p>
 <p>682. But when that Concealed One of the Concealed Ones is not uncovered, and those lights shine not, judgments are stirred up, and judgment is exercised.</p>
 <p>683. Who therefore is the cause of that judgment? The benevolence of the benevolences, because it is not uncovered, and therefore do sinners change Mercy into judgment (<i>as regardeth themselves</i>).</p>
 <p>684. But because this is said, Gen. xix. 24: "From Tetragrammaton out of heaven," it is said concerning Zauir Anpin, Microprosopus.</p>
 <p>685. And whence is this obtained? Because it is written (<i>in the preceding passage</i>): MN HShMIM, <i>Men Ha-Shamayim</i>, out of heaven. (<i>But the word</i></p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>HShMIM Ha-Shamayim, is equivalent to</i>) ASh VMIM, <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>Ash Ve-Mim</i>, fire and water, Mercy and judgment, in the antithesis of that (condition) wherein no Judgment is found at all.</p>
 <p>686. We have learned that this nose (<i>of Microprosopus</i>) is short, <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a> and when the smoke commenceth to issue therefrom, it departeth thence swiftly, and judgment is exercised.</p>
 <p>687. But what hindereth that nose that it may not produce smoke? The nose of the Ancient and Holy One; for He is also called before all others ARK APIM, <i>Arikh Aphim</i>, Long of Nose.</p>
 <p>688. And this is the Arcanum which we have learned: Between the two words, IHVH, IHVH, Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton, an accent is interpolated <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">3</font></a> (<i>whensoever these two are found in juxtaposition in Scripture</i>).</p>
 <p>689. For wheresoever an y name is repeated twice over, a distinction is made (<i>between them</i>), as when it is said, Gen. xxii. 11, "Abraham, Abraham;" also, Gen. xlvi. 2, "Jacob, Jacob;" also, 1 Sam. iii. 10, "Samuel, Samuel;" where, by the <i>Psiq</i> accent, these pairs of names are distinguished; excepting that place, Exod. iii. 4, "Moses, Moses," where no accent interveneth.</p>
 <p>690. For what reason? "Abraham, Abraham," Gen. xxii. xx (<i>herein therefore is an accent introduced because</i></p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>that</i>) the latter (<i>of these two names</i>) denoteth that which is perfect, but the former that which is not as yet perfect; for at this time he is perfected with ten temptations, and therefore is the (<i>Psiq</i>) accent interpolated, for. at this time he can hardly be said to be the same man as he was before.</p>
 <p>691. (<i>When it is said</i>), "Jacob, Jacob" (Gen. xlvi. 2), the latter denoteth that which is perfect, the former that which is not as yet perfect; for now the messenger had come to him from his son Joseph, and over him was the Schechinah at rest.</p>
 <p>692. Also, now at this time was perfected in the earth the holy tree, similar unto the Supernal One, in having twelve limitations and seventy branches, <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a> which were not hitherto completed; and therefore the latter denoteth that which is perfect, and the former that which is not as yet perfect; whence the accent falleth between them.</p>
 <p>693. In the passage, "Samuel, Samuel" (1 Sam. iii. 10), an accent is also interpolated: wherefore? The latter name denoteth that which is perfect; the former that which is not as yet perfect; for now he is a prophet, whereas before this he was not as yet a prophet.</p>
 <p>694. But when it is said, Exod. iii. 4: "Moses, Moses," no accent is interpolated, because he was perfect from the very day of his birth, seeing it is written, Exod. ii. 2: "And she saw him, that he was good."</p>
 <p>695. So also here between these two names of Tetragrammaton, Exod. xxxiv. 6, the <i>Psiq</i> accent is interpolated; for the first is indeed a perfect name, but the latter is thoroughly and completely perfect.</p>
 <p>696. But Moses speaketh thus in the place of judgment, in order that for them he may cause Mercy to</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>
 <p>descend upon Microprosopus from the Most Holy Ancient One.</p>
 <p>697. For thus is the tradition. So great was the virtue of Moses that he could make the measures of Mercy descend.</p>
 <p>698. And when the Ancient One is uncovered toward Microprosopus all things are beheld in the light of Mercy, and the nose is appeased, and fire and smoke issue not therefrom.</p>
 <p>699. Like as it is written, Isa. xlviii. 9: "And with my praise will I defer mine anger for thee."</p>
 <p>700. Also we have learned: The nose hath two nostrils. From the one issueth a flaming smoke, and it entereth into the opening of the Great Abyss.</p>
 <p>701. And from the other nostril issueth afire which is kindled by its flame; and it floweth into four thousand worlds, which are upon His left side.</p>
 <p>702. Truly, he who is the cause of war is called the fire of Tetragrammaton, the consuming fire, the fire which consumeth all other fires.</p>
 <p>703. And that fire is not mitigated save by the fire of the altar.</p>
 <p>704. And that smoke which issueth forth from the other nostril is not mitigated unless by the smoke of the sacrifice of the altar. But all things depend from the nose.</p>
 <p>705. Therefore is it written, Gen. viii. 12: "And Tetragrammaton smelled a sweet savour." For all these are attributed unto the nose, to smell a savour, and to emit smoke and fire, and red colour, and therefore is it opposed unto the benevolence (<i>namely, the forehead</i>).</p>
 <p>706. And for that cause is it written, Exod. iv. 14: "And the anger of Tetragrammaton was kindled." Deut. vii. 4: "And the anger of Tetragrammaton will be kindled." Exod. xxii. 24: "And My wrath is kindled." Deut. vi. 15: "Lest the wrath of Tetragrammaton be kindled." Which are all to be understood concerning Zauir Anpin, or Microprosopus.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="tku39.htm#fr_115">192:1</a> Right and left exist in Microprosopus, while in Macroprosopus all is right. The latter is rather to be symbolised by a profile, as I have before remarked, than by a full face, as in the case of the former.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_116">193:1</a> The ordinary English version renders it "nostrils" and not "nose," but in the Hebrew the word is singular.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_117">193:2</a> Isa. xlviii. 9 is translated in the ordinary English version: "For my name's sake will I defer mine anger;" but Parkhurst in his Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon, art. ChTM, says the correct rendering is "for my name's sake will I lengthen my nose." Knorr de Rosenroth, in his Latin version of § 664, renders it by, "corrugatur," which is hardly correct.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_117"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_118">193:3</a> The word AP, Ath, stands alike for the words "nose" and "anger."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_118"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_119">193:4</a> if we carefully examine this obscure passage, I think we shall find that the number five is the key to unlock its symbolism; for five is the fifth Sephira, <i>Geburah</i>, GBVRH, Strength or Severity, which operates <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a> through judgment, and ultimately through the numbers and intelligences of the planet Mars. Now, the 1,400 severities are the fivefold form of RP, <i>Raph</i>, which = the idea of terror. and RP = 280, which x 5 = 1,400. And the least number of 1,400 is 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 5. Also 1,400 = ATh = chaos, or substance of anything. Finally, these are extended Into five parts of Macroprosopus--viz., nose, mouth, arms, hands, fingers. And the number 5 = H.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_120">194:1</a> See Introduction. GBVR (the root being GBR) = 211= IAR, a flood. This is of course by Gematria.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_121">194:2</a> This formidable sounding arrangement is only our previous 1,400 considered on another plane of operation, in the material world.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_122">194:3</a> This is 1,400 again in its most material forms in Asiah; the number five at the end in simply the number of the Sephira of Severity added to the other.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="tku40.htm#fr_126">196:3</a> This accent is called <i>Psiq</i>, and in the grammar of Gesenius is classed as the twentieth accent, or the fifth of the third series known as the "lesser distinctives." It is represented by a vertical line placed between the two words to which it applies. An example of its use is to be found in Exod. xxxiv. 6: "Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton (<i>between these two words a Psiq accent is introduced</i>), merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth." It is worthy of note that the word here translated "long-suffering" is ARK APIM, <i>Arikh Aphim</i>, Long of Nose.</p>

The twelve limitations are the twelve sons of Jacob, and the seventy branches the total number of the combined families.</p>
