 <p>IN compliance with a desire repeatedly expressed by the Committee of the Hebrew Literature Society, I have undertaken to translate Maimonides <i>Dalalāt</i><i> al-Ḥairin</i>, better known by the Hebrew title <i>Moreh Nebuchim</i>, and I offer the first instalment of my labours in the present volume. This contains--(1) A short Life of Maimonides, in which special attention is given to his alleged apostasy. (2) An analysis of the whole of the Moreh Nebuchim. (3) A translation of the First Part of this work from the Arabic, with explanatory and critical notes.</p>  
 <p>Parts of the Translation have been contributed by Mr. Joseph Abrahams, B.A., PhḌ., and Rev. H. Gollancz--the Introduction by the former, and the first twenty-five chapters by the latter.</p>  
 <p>In conclusion I beg to tender my thanks to Rev. A. Loewy, Editor of the Publications of the Hebrew Literature Society, for his careful revision of my manuscript and proofs, and to Mr. A. Neubauer, M.A., for his kindness in supplying me with such information as I required.</p>
