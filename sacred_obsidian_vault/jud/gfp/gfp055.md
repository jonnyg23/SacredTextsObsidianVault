 <p><i>Shama‘</i> is used homonymously. It signifies "to hear," and also "to obey." As regards the first signification, comp. "Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth" (Exod. xxiii. 13); "And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house" (Gen. xlv. 26). Instances of this kind are numerous.</p>  
 <p>Equally frequent are the instances of this verb being used in the sense of "to obey": "And they hearkened (<i>shama‘</i>) not unto Moses" (Exod. vi. 9). "If they obey (<i>yishme‘ü</i>) and serve him (Job xxxvi. 11); "Shall we then hearken (<i>nishma‘</i>) unto you" (Neh. xiii. 27); "Whosoever will not hearken (<i>yishma‘</i>) unto thy words" (Josh. i. 18).</p>  
 <p>The verb also signifies "to know" ("to understand"), comp. "A nation whose tongue, i.e., its language, thou shalt not understand" (<i>tishma‘</i>) (Deut. xxviii. 49).

 <p>the verb appears to have the second signification, it implies that God responded to the prayer of man and fulfilled his wish, or did not respond and did not fulfil his wish: "I will surely hear his cry" (Exod. xxii. 23); "I will hear, for I am gracious" (<i>ib</i>. 27); "Bow down thine ear, and hear" (2 Kings xix. 16); "But the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you" (Deut. i. 45); "Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear" (Isa. i. 15); "For I will not hear thee" (Jer. vii. 16). There are many instances in which <i>shama‘</i> has this sense.</p>
