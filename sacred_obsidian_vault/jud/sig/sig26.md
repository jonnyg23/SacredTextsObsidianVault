 <p>As the servant longs for the masters hand, so craves the cantors soul,<br> O extend Thy mercy upon him, rend his debt-recording scroll.<br> "Unto Me return, then will I to thee"were this Thy word unsaid,<br> Like a captain humbled while at his post he now would droop his head.<br> To Thy servant, Lord, Thou wilt surely ope the penitential way,<br> May his fruit be sweet as he stands to lead our prayers to Thee to-day.<br> As we watch our brother, behold, we note the grey that streaks his hair,<br> And his heart a-swim in a sense of sin as praying stands he there.<br> Let the fervent breath of Thy suppliant be witness for his heart,<br> Let him but return to Thee this once, he never will depart.</p>
