 <p>O my God, I know that my sins are too great to tell,<br> And my trespasses too many to remember,<br> Yet as a drop from the sea will I make mention of some,<br> And make confession of them;<br> Perhaps I shall silence the roar of their waves and their crashing,<br> "And Thou wilt hear from heaven and forgive."<br> I have trespassed against Thy law,<br> I have despised Thy commandments,<br> I have abhorred them in my heart,<br> And with my mouth spoken slander.<br> I have committed iniquity,<br> And I have wrought evil,<br> I have been presumptuous,<br> I have done violence,<br> I have plastered over falsehood,<br> I have counselled evil, <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a><br> I have lied, I have scoffed,<br> I have revolted, I have blasphemed,<br> I have been rebellious and perverse and sinful,<br> I have stiffened my neck,<br> I have loathed Thy rebukes and done wickedly,<br> I have corrupted my ways,<br> I have strayed from my paths,<br> I have transgressed and turned away from Thy commandments.<br> "But Thou art just in all that is come upon me<br> For Thou hast dealt truly and I have dealt wickedly."</p>
