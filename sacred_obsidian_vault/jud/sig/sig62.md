 <p>Who shall utter Thy mighty deeds,<br> For Thou madest a division of the ball of the earth into twain, half dry land, half water,<br> And didst surround the water with the sphere of air,<br> In which the wind turneth and turneth in its going,<br> And resteth in its circuits,<br> And didst encompass the air with the sphere of fire, <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a><br> And the foundations of these four elements are but one foundation,<br> And their sources one,<br> And from it they issue and are renewed,<br> "And from thence was it separated and became four heads."</p>
