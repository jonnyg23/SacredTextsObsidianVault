 <p>O Lord, who shall requite Thy goodness?<br> For Thou hast placed the soul in the body to vivify it,<br> And to teach and show it the path of life<br> And to deliver it from evil;<br> Thou hast formed man from a pinch of clay and breathed into him a soul,<br> And didst impart to him the spirit of wisdom<br> Whereby man is divided from the beasts<br> That he may ascend to a higher sphere.<br> Thou hast him enclosed in Thy universe,<br> And directest and beholdest his deeds from without,<br> And all that would conceal him from Thee<br> Thou beholdest from within and without.</p>
