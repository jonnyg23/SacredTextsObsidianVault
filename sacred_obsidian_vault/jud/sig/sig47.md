 <p>Let earth and sea and the Temples throng<br>   And every highway become exalted,<br> The world and all who therein do dwell,<br> And every creature of fen and fell,<br>   In a melody nevermore halted,<br>     With forest and meadow and all their yield,<br>     Fruit of the woodland and fruit of the field,<br> Unite in an ecstasy deep and strong<br>   In a rapturous endeavour,<br> With a single mouth in a single song,<br> Their spheral symphony to prolong,<br>   And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>  
 <p>The pundits vainly enquire His source,<br>   His secret, the wonder of His foundation.<br> Where is His throne, or His light, or His force,<br>   And who in His council dares take a station?<br> Sublime and hidden beyond our quest,<br> His essence unfathomed and unexpressed,<br>   Even in sacred song and story,<br> This to declare is our sole resource,<br> That all the earth in its daily course<br>   Overflows with its Makers glory.<br> This is the reach of our poor endeavour,<br>   Then who beside shall by man be blest?<br> For He is One on His throne above,<br>   And His lonely sway shall be shaken never.<br> Then let all creatures in awe and love,<br> Man or insect, or serpent or dove,<br>   Now bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>

 <p>His bands of ministers gleam and flash<br>   Like living coals or with flames for features,<br> Squadrons of four-winged cherubim dash,<br>   By the steps of His throne are the mystic creatures<br> With their chariot-wheels, and at His behest,<br> They run in His service with holy zest,<br>   All united together run,<br>   One in song and in service one,<br> Every being of all the blest<br>   In a loyalty naught can sever.<br> Wherefore sing to Him every breast,<br> Tranced in His adoration rest,<br>   And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>  
 <p>His domain is established, His Peace secure,<br>   On the beams of the earth and the clouds He rides,<br> The homesick exile he vows to cure,<br>   Who now amid thistle and thorn resides,<br>   And the day of redemption in trust abides.<br> Yea, the remnant shall yet as a people endure,<br>   Regathered, forgiven, when He decides,<br> And live as a nation unique and pure,<br>     For when it was chosen and glorified,<br>     Its mission it knew and its task descried,<br>   That the love of God be its high endeavour,<br> And its purpose His reverence to assure,<br> The world to His worship by faith allure,<br>   And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>
