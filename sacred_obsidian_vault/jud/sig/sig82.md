 <p>O Lord, who can reach Thy wisdom?<br> For Thou gavest the soul the faculty of knowledge that is fixed therein,<br> And knowledge is the fount of her glory.<br> Therefore hath destruction no power over her,<br> But she maintaineth herself by the stability of her foundation,<br> For such is her nature and secret;<br> The soul with her wisdom shall not see death.<br> Nevertheless shall her punishment be visited upon her,<br> A punishment bitterer than death,<br> Though be she pure she shall obtain favour<br> And shall laugh on the last day.<br> But if she hath been defiled,<br> She shall wander to and fro for a space in wrath and anger,<br> And all the days of her uncleanness<br> Shall she dwell vagabond and outcast;<br> "She shall touch no hallowed thing,<br> And to the sanctuary she shall not come<br> Till the days of her purification be fulfilled."</p>
