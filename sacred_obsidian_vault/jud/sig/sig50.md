 <p>Who is like unto Thee to uncover the deeps,<br>   And who hath Thy power to raise and cast down?<br> Show Thy marvellous love to the captive who weeps,<br>   O Worker of wonders, of awesome renown!</p>  
 <p>Thy children belovèd intoned a new song<br>   When Egypts proud host found a watery grave,<br> There was praise from the saints in their jubilant throng<br>   When the wheels of the chariots clogged in the wave.</p>  
 <p>Thy fondlings storm-tossed were all weeping and tired<br>   When the great roaring flood-tides before them arose,<br> But Thy hand led them safe to the haven desired<br>   And the waters returned, overwhelming their foes.</p>  
 <p>The chariots of Pharaoh and all that great host<br>   God cast in the billows and covered them oer,<br> But His people trod sea-bottom, coast unto coast,<br>   He admonished the sea and it dried like the shore.</p>

 <p>Thus, Lord, do Thou Zion support and uphold,<br>   Arise, for the hour of her grace is at hand,<br> The day long appointed to sing as of old,<br>   God reigneth, His Kingdom forever shall stand.</p>
