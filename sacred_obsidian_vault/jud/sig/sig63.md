 <p>Who can declare Thy greatness?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of fire<br> with the sphere of the firmament,<br> Wherein is the Moon,<br> Which by the splendour of the Sun raceth up, panting and shining,<br> And in nine and twenty days fulfilleth her revolving<br> And then remounteth her bounded circuit.<br> Of her secrets some lie unveiled and some are unsearchable,<br> And her body is to the body of the earth<br> As one part is to thirty-nine parts,<br> And from month to month she stirreth up the world and its chances,<br> And its good and evil happenings,<br> According to the will of her Creator,<br> "To make known to the sons of men His mighty deeds."</p>
