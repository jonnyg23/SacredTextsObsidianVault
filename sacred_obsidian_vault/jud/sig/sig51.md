 <p>O God, my Sun, up now and rise, I pray thee,<br> And be as the moon to illumine my darkness:<br> Wherefore wilt Thou play the passing wayfarer<br> And vanish like the fleeing gazelle?<br> When shall the bud come to blossom,<br> And the tender grape yield its sweet savour?<br> How long wilt Thou cast off the remnants of Joseph?<br> I was as a lamb led to the slaughter,<br> One man drawing me from the fold and another performing the sacrifice.<br> The lion rose murderous against me,<br> And the wild ass breaketh my bones.<br> The wild boar tore me, breathing fury,<br> Pushing westwards and northwards.</p>  
 <p>Dread God, who hast stretched out the heavens,<br> Who closest and none can open,<br> Now at last reprove kings for my sake <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a><br> For far be it from Thee to be forgetful!<br> Thou shalt bring forth my prisoners from the pit:<br> For the sake of our hero-ancestors righteousness,<br> And shalt cleave the crown of the woman of Uz<br> And shave off the hair of Esau.</p>  
 <p>Take the young brood and prosper them,<br> But do <i>not</i> let go the mother.<br> O restore the maiden in her beautiful freshness,<br> And fill with moisture all that is withered.<br> Renew the Temple and the altar<br> And establish singing men for Thy praise;<br> One to glow with a song of loves,<br> And one to make melody for the chief musician.<br> Thus wilt Thou cause the horn of the Messiah to shoot up,<br> And I shall be wholly joyful.</p>
