 <p><i>Establish peace, for us, O Lord,<br>   In everlasting grace,<br> Nor let us be of Thee abhorred,<br>   Who art our dwelling-place</i>.</p>  
 <p>We wander ever to and fro,<br>   Or sit in chains in exile drear,<br> Yet still proclaim whereer we go,<br>   The splendour of Our Lord is here.</p>  
 <p>Sore-tried, involved in heathen mesh,<br>   Deep-sunk as though in midmost sea,<br> Each morn the thought is roused afresh,<br>   Who will arise to set us free?</p>  
 <p>From rampart and from mountain reft,<br>   Immured in thick and pitchy gloom,<br> Had not the Lord a remnant left,<br>   Death in the dust had been our doom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>All realms behold our driven seed,<br>   Like wounded doves we fly their hate.<br> All nations hunt us and impede<br>   And in the desert lie in wait.</p>  
 <p>Gripped as a bird within a net,<br>   Ever pursued in deadly chase,<br> With harsh devices daily met,<br>   Perchance our God will grant us grace.</p>  
 <p>How many periods are past,<br>   And we in exile lingering,<br> By enemies encompassed fast,<br>   Who jeer that now we have no King!</p>  
 <p>They plot and league in lying spite<br>   Gods truth with cunning to eclipse,<br> Our tongues, they say, shall give us might,<br>   We own no master to our lips.</p>  
 <p>Shine forth, great God, in splendid flame,<br>   Bare Thy great arm of ancient days,<br> Be jealous for Thy glorious name,<br>   Not unto us, O Lord, the praise.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>To dust the Arab kingdom sweep,<br>   The ravenous beasts who tear and bite,<br> Who rend our scattered sons as sheep,<br>   Whose motto is to seize by might.</p>  
 <p>Our heritage they have possessed,<br>   Exiled, devoured us at their will,<br> Consumed and wasted and oppressed<br>   And machinate against us still.</p>  
 <p>So low our nation hath been brought,<br>   So many masters override,<br> A little more and it were naught,<br>   Had not the Lord been on its side.</p>  
 <p>Beneath the feet of slaves we bend,<br>   In pit and prison we are pressed,<br> The hunters at our necks impend,<br>   We labour still and have no rest.</p>  
 <p>Where is that kindness from above<br>   Of which Thy servitors have heard,<br> The boon of Thy peculiar love,<br>   For which we have our fathers word?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>O glorious sovran of the height,<br>   Abase, destroy their topmost tower,<br> The final marvel bring to light,<br>   Arise and save us, show Thy power.</p>  
 <p>Uplift the lowly from the mire,<br>   And make our meditation sweet,<br> The lily gather from the brier,<br>   And our salvation, Lord, complete.</p>  
 <p>With joy the lost and wounded bless,<br>   Wipe from all eyes the tears that run,<br> Unveil the orb of righteousness,<br>   For unto us is born a son.</p>  
 <p>O break the yoke, the slave release,<br>   Rebuke the arrogant again,<br> And send Thy messenger of peace,<br>   Whose feet are welcome as the rain.</p>  
 <p>Rejoice, my dear despised, the King<br>   In all His beauty thou shalt see,<br> And this the song that men shall sing<br>   In Judahs land, our own and free.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>The prayer of the meek finds grace,<br>   And God will hearken and forgive,<br> Tread down corruption, sin erase,<br>   And in His light will let us live.</p>  
 <p>My song of penitence He ranks<br>   As though an altar-sacrifice.<br> Healed of my sins I give Him thanks,<br>   Who spite our deeds remits the price</p>  
 <p>Delight and peace from Thee we hail,<br>   Thy hand Thy peoples sin outscored,<br> Drew oer iniquity a veil<br>   Nor gave wrongdoing its reward.</p>  
 <p>Perpetual ascend to Thee<br>   Thy peoples and Thy servants cries,<br> O let us Thy compassion see,<br>   And Thy salvation greet our eyes.</p>
