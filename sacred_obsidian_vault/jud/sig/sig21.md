 <p><i>God:</i></p>  
 <p>Though bereaved and in mourning, why sit thus in tears?<br> Shall thy spirit surrender its hopes to its fears?<br> Though the end has been long and no light yet appears,<br>        Hope on, hapless one, a while longer.</p>  
 <p>I will send thee an angel My path to prepare,<br> On the brow of Mount Zion thy King to declare,<br> The Lord ever regnant shall reign again there,<br>        Thy King, O proclaim, comes to Zion.</p>  
 <p><i>Israel:</i></p>  
 <p>How long, O my God, shall I wait Thee in vain?<br> How long shall Thy people in exile remain?<br> Shall the sheep ever shorn never utter their pain<br>        But dumbly through all go on waiting?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>God:</i></p>  
 <p>Have faith, hapless one, I will pardon and free,<br> Not always shalt thou be abhorrent to Me,<br> But be Mine een as I shall return unto thee,<br>        Tis yet but a little space longer.</p>  
 <p><i>Israel:</i></p>  
 <p>How long till the turn of my fate shall draw near,<br> How long ere the sealed and the closed be made clear,<br> And the palace of strangers a roof shall appear?</p>  
 <p><i>God:</i></p>  
 <p>Hope on for a shelter and refuge.<br> With healing shall yet thy entreaties be graced,<br> As when Caphtor was crushed shalt thou triumph re-taste,<br> And the flowers cast off shall re-bloom in the waste,<br>        Hope on but a little space longer.</p>  
 <p><i>Israel:</i></p>  
 <p>My people of yore neath one people was drowned,<br> But from Egypt or Babel deliverance found,<br> But now we are hopelessly compassed around<br> By four birds of prey grim and speckled.<br> They have eaten my flesh, yet to leave me are loath.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>God:</i></p>  
 <p>The Rock you must trust to remember His oath,<br> Your lover that went shall return to His troth,<br>        Hope on, hapless one, a whit longer.</p>
