 <p>May it please Thee, O Lord my God,<br> To return to me in mercy,<br> And to bring me back to Thee in perfect repentance.<br> O dispose my heart and turn Thine ear to supplication,<br> And open my heart to Thy law,<br> And plant in my thoughts the fear of Thee, <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a><br> And decree for me good decrees,<br> And annul the evil decrees against me,<br> And lead me not into the power of temptation,<br> Nor into the power of contempt,<br> And from all evil chances deliver me,<br> And hide me in Thy shadow until the havoc pass by,<br> And be with my mouth in my meditation,<br> And keep my ways from sin through my tongue,<br> And remember me when Thou rememberest and favourest Thy people,<br> And when Thou rebuildest Thy Temple,<br> That I may behold the bliss of Thy chosen ones,<br> And purify me to seek diligently Thy Sanctuary devastated and ruined,<br> And to cherish its stones and its dust,<br> And the clods of its desolation,<br> And rebuild Thou its wastes!</p>
