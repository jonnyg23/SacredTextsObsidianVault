 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">34</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE DAY OF JUDGMENT</h3>  
 <p>Propound a mystery, O my tongue, and give praise to God,<br> For He hath delivered me and exalted my horn.<br> Awake, my heart, and turn to the Almighty,<br> And in awe of His anger let my hand be lifted to Him.</p>  
 <p>Set the Most High before thee, and know that every thought<br> And every hidden imagining are to Him not hidden.<br> Dread the day of His wrath, and the dreadful position<br> Wherein is help or refuge for no creature.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>On the day He shall judge the peoples and destroy beings<br> And wither all His adversaries as with the fiery blast of his nostrils<br> And decree the fate of all potentates, officers and rulers,<br> Nor pay regard to mighty princes.<br> And destroy tyrants and cut off the scornful,<br> The proud and presumptuous who rely on the<br> preciousness of their palanquin;</p>  
 <p>Who have forgotten their Creator and put their trust in their riches<br> And prided themselves above high God,<br> Who humbleth and uplifteth,<br> And have rebelled against their Master,<br> With their host and their multitude,<br> And the silver they have acquired, and the fine gold and sapphires, <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a><br> And have built structures, and carved out windows,<br> And erected palaces, and battlements and chambers,<br> Nor remember the Almighty,<br> But wax fat in the abundance of power,<br> And speak arrogantly to Him<br> And roar like young lions.</p>  
 <p>But He is great and fearful,<br> And girded about with might;<br> He calleth the generations<br> And from Him are the hill-tops.<br> Doth He not regard the lowly,<br> And abase every one that is proud?<br> He will raise up the broken pauper<br> And lift him from the dunghill.</p>  
 <p>Woe to them for this,<br> When their Creator shall sit in judgment,<br> To take vengeance on them, their grown and their little ones, <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a><br> And they shall fall into the net, weeping bitterly,<br> And when quaffing the cup of foaming wine<br> Shall drain only dregs,<br> And shall be consumed in their iniquity,<br> And their riches shall not profit them,<br> And all they build shall be upset<br> As though overthrown by strangers.</p>  
 <p>And the God of the ages will abhor the man of blood<br> And will break the haughty<br> Like a potters vessel,<br> And will bring low their pride<br> And silence their psaltery<br> And make their voice sound<br> Like a ghost from the dust,<br> And demolish their battlements<br> And their houses of pleasure,<br> And make over their inheritance<br> To strangers and aliens, <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a><br> And the gadfly shall sting them<br> To determined destruction,<br> And they shall be trodden of passers-by<br> Like a ground or a street.</p>  
 <p>Therefore turn ye from them and their counsels,<br> Nor vie with them<br> Lest your fate be as that of these arrogant.</p>
