 <p>Who shall understand the mysteries of Thy creations?<br> For Thou hast exalted above the ninth sphere the sphere of Intelligence.<br> It is the Temple confronting us,<br> "The tenth that shall be sacred to the Lord,"<br> It is the Sphere transcending height,<br> To which conception cannot reach,<br> And there stands the veiled palanquin of Thy glory.<br> From the silver of Truth hast Thou cast it,<br> And of the gold of Reason hast Thou wrought its arms,<br> And on a pillar of Righteousness set its cushions<br> And from Thy power is its existence,<br> And from and toward Thee its yearning,<br> "And unto Thee shall be its desire."</p>
