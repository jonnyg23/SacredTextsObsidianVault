 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Selected Religious Poems of Solomon ibn Gabirol</i>, tr. by Israel Zangwill, [1923], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
 <p>Thou art wise. And wisdom is the fount of life and from Thee it welleth,<br> And by the side of Thy wisdom all human knowledge turneth to folly.<br> Thou art wise, more ancient than all primal things,<br> And wisdom was the nursling at Thy side.<br> Thou art wise, and Thou hast not learnt from any beside Thee,<br> Nor acquired wisdom from any save Thyself. <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a><br> Thou art wise, and from Thy wisdom Thou hast set apart Thy appointed purpose,<br> Like a craftsman and an artist<br> To draw up the films of Being from Nothingness<br> As light is drawn that darteth from the eye:<br> Without bucket from the fountain of light hath<br> Thy workman drawn it up,<br> And without tool hath he wrought,<br> Hewing, graving, cleansing, refining,<br> Calling unto the void and it was cleft,<br> And unto existence and it was urged,<br> And to the universe and it was spread out;<br> Establishing the clouds of the heavens<br> And with his hand joining together the pavilions of the spheres,<br> And fastening with the loops of power the tent-folds of creation,<br> For the might of his hand extendeth to the uttermost borders,<br> "Linking the uttermost ends."</p>
