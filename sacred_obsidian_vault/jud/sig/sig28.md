 <p>The breath of the remnant of Jacob shall praise Thee,<br> For with testimony confirmed Thou hast made him Thy witness<br> And keepest Thy covenant with him and Thy kindness;<br> Therefore shall he thank Thee on the day Thou hast appointed judgment.</p>  
 <p>The breath of the company of Israel shall ravish<br> Thy heart,<br>         Daily proclaiming Thy Unity.<br> To be judged of Thee and by Thy hand inscribed<br>         In the book of life,<br> They stand this day according to Thy ordinance,<br>         For all things are Thy servants.</p>  
 <p>The breath of the nation set apart from the seventy<br> And weighing true in the scales of righteousness,<br>         Shall hail Thee as King,<br> A monarch of justice and righteousness,<br> Who sits on the Throne of righteousness,<br>         A righteous judge.</p>  
 <p>The breath of the congregations chosen of Thee shall thank Thee,<br>         And their bannered tribes, <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a><br> O Thou who stretchest Thy hand to receive the transgressors of Thy judgments,<br> That Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest<br> And be in the right when Thou judgest.</p>  
 <p>The breath of those conserved in Israel,<br>         Thy servants who fear Thee,<br>         Shall hail Thee as mighty.<br> Thou art near to all that call upon Thee,<br> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of<br>         Thy throne.</p>  
 <p>The breath of the holy ones hallowing Thee,<br>         Responding in all their passion of desire,<br>         Acclaims Thee as holy.<br> Holy God, King living forever, they cry,<br> And would that our mouths were as full as the sea<br>         With song!</p>
