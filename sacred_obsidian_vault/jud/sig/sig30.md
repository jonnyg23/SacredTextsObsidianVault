 <p>To the glorious one, girdled by praise,<br> Great in deeds and tremendous in ways,<br> Who filleth with wonders our days,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Lord whose decrees never fail,<br> Who spreadeth the clouds like a veil,<br> And maketh the dust hard as mail,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Builder whose measures none knows,<br> By whom the high heavens arose,<br> And beauty like lightning that glows,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Judge who His servants will spare,<br> For the souls of His faithful will care,<br> And will make their inheritance fair,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Chief on whose breast Right is borne,<br> Who is served by the seed to Him sworn,<br> Who gathereth lilies from thorn,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>

 <p>To the Washer who whiteneth sin,<br> Whose cloud blotteth evil within,<br> Whose forgiveness repentance can win,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Alchemist turning his gold<br> To the diamonds perfection, clear, cold,<br> Like the streams that Damascus enfold,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>  
 <p>To the Lord who His scattered will keep,<br> To whom cries of the lowly that weep<br> Are dearer than bullocks or sheep,<br>         Blow ye at New Moon the trumpet.</p>
