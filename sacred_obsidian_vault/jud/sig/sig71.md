 <p>Who shall find words for Thy tremendous works?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of Mars with a sixth sphere,<br> A vast and mighty encompassing sphere,<br> Wherein dwelleth the righteous planet (Jupiter). <a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a><br> And his body is greater than that of the earth seventy-five times<br> By the measure of her breadth.<br> And he completeth his revolution in twelve years,<br> And is as a planet of goodwill and love,<br> Stirring up the fear of heaven,<br> And righteousness and repentance and every good quality,<br> And increasing all crops and fruits,<br> And causing wars to cease,<br> And enmity and strife;<br> And his appointed task is to repair by righteousness every breach,<br> "For He judgeth the world in righteousness."</p>
