 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Selected Religious Poems of Solomon ibn Gabirol</i>, tr. by Israel Zangwill, [1923], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h4 align="center">XXXII.</h4>  
 <p>Who shall know the secret of Thy operations?<br> For Thou hast provided the body with the means to do Thy work,<br> And Thou hast given it eyes to see Thy signs<br> And ears to hear of Thy tremendous deeds,<br> And thought to understand the fringe of Thy secrets,<br> And a mouth to declare Thy praise,<br> And a tongue to proclaim Thy might to all corners,<br> Even as I to-day, "Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid",<br> Am declaring according to the feebleness of my tongue.<br> A shadow of a shade of Thy sublimity, <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a><br> For these are but a fraction of Thy ways.<br> How mighty then must be the sum of them,<br> "For they are life to those who find them."<br> By them, all who hear of them may recognize Thee,<br> Even if they cannot see the face of Thy splendour.<br> For whoso hath not heard of Thy might,<br> How can he recognize Thy Godhead,<br> And how can Thy truth enter his heart,<br> And how can he fix his thoughts on Thy service?<br> Therefore hath Thy servant found the heart<br> To make mention before his God<br> Of a shade of a shadow of the sum of His praises.<br> Peradventure thereby less shall be exacted of his iniquity<br> "For wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his Lord if not with these heads?"</p>
