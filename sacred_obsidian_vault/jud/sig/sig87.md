 <p>O God, my countenance falleth,<br> When I remember all wherein I have provoked Thee.<br> For all the good which Thou hast bestowed on me<br> I have requited Thee with evil.<br> For Thou hast created me not from necessity, but from grace,<br> And not by compulsion of circumstance<br> But by favour and love.<br> And before I was,<br> With Thy mercies didst Thou precede me,<br> And breathe into me a spirit and call me into being,<br> And after I came forth into the light of the world<br> Thou didst not forsake me,<br> But like a tender father didst Thou watch over my growing up, <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a><br> And as a nurse fostereth a suckling didst Thou foster me.<br> Upon the breasts of my mother Thou madest me rest trustfully,<br> And with Thy delight didst satisfy me.<br> And when I essayed my feet, Thou didst strengthen my standing<br> And didst take me in Thine arms and teach me to walk.<br> And wisdom and discipline didst Thou impart to me,<br> And from all trouble and distress didst Thou relieve me,<br> And at the time of the passing away of Thy wrath<br> In the shadow of Thy hand didst Thou hide me,<br> And from how many sorrows concealed from mine eyes didst Thou deliver me!<br> For before the hardship came<br> Thou didst prepare the remedy for my distress all unbeknown to me,<br> And when from some injury I was unguarded,<br> Thou didst guard me,<br> And when I came within the fangs of lions<br> Thou didst break the teeth of the whelps and deliver me thence,<br> And when evil and constant distress anguished me,<br> Thou hast freely healed me,<br> And when Thy dreadful judgment came upon the world,<br> Thou didst deliver me from the sword <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a><br> And didst save me from the pestilence,<br> And in famine didst feed me,<br> And with plenty sustain me.<br> And when I provoked Thee,<br> Thou didst chastise me as a father chastiseth his son,<br> And when I called out from the depths of my sorrow,<br> My soul was precious in Thy sight,<br> Nor didst Thou send me empty away.<br> But all this didst Thou yet exceed and add to<br> When Thou gavest me a perfect faith<br> To believe that Thou art the God of Truth<br> And that Thy Law is true and Thy prophets are true.<br> For Thou hast not set my portion with the<br> rebels and those who rise up against Thee<br> And the foolish multitude that blaspheme Thy name;<br> Who make mock of Thy law,<br> And contend with Thy servants,<br> And give the lie to Thy prophets,<br> Making a show of innocence<br> But with cunning below,<br> Exhibiting a pure and stainless soul,<br> While underneath lurketh the bright leprous spot:<br> Like to a vessel full of shameful things,<br> Washed on the outside with the waters of deceit,<br> And defiling all that is within.</p>
