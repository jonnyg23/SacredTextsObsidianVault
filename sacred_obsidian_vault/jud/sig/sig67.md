 <p>Who shall understand Thy secret?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of this shining one<br> With a fourth sphere, wherein is the Sun<br> That completeth his circuit in a perfect year.<br> And his body is one hundred and seventy times<br> greater than that of the earth,<br> According to indications and devisings of intellect.<br> And he is the apportioner of light to all the stars of the heavens,<br> And giveth to kings salvation<br> And majesty, dominion and awe,<br> And reneweth marvels on the earth,<br> Whether for war or for peace,<br> And rooteth up kingdoms,<br> And establisheth and exalteth others in their stead<br> And hath power to abase and uplift with a high hand,<br> But all according to the will of the Creator who created him in wisdom.<br> Every day he prostrateth himself before the King,<br> And taketh his stand in the house of his course,<br> And at dawn he raiseth his head<br> And boweth towards the west in the evening.<br> "In the evening he goeth down and in the morning he returneth."</p>
