 <p><i>Lord, what is man but flesh and blood? O weep!<br> His days unconscious stray, like shadows sweep,<br> His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep</i>.</p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? A carcase fouled and trodden,<br>   A noxious creature brimming with deceit,<br>   A fading flowr that shrivels in the heat.<br> Wert Thou as stern as he with sin is sodden,<br>   How could he face Thy wrath? Ah, see him creep:<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? He rolls in mud and lies,<br>   Insanely fouls the clean and spoils the fine.<br>   Did but Thy justice follow his design,<br> Mown like the grass were he, or herb that dies.<br>   In dooms dark hour be then Thy pity deep,<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? Proud, born in sin, defiant,<br>   His drink is violence and on wrong he feeds.<br>   Sea-tossed and furnace-fierce, if judged by deeds<br> He would be crushed like weakling fighting giant.<br>   Thy mercy therefore let his prayer reap,<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? A trickster vile, abhorred.<br>   If Thou shouldst deal with him in equity,<br>   A mouldered robe, a scattered cloud were he.<br> Therefore forgiveness is his best award.<br>   His base is dust, his form a clayey heap,<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? A tree despoiled, mere stubble<br>   Its only fruit. Didst Thou his sin repay,<br>   He like a snail or wax would melt away.<br> Therefore forgive, nor press him in his trouble.<br>   Moth-like he rots, old joys he can but weep,<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lord, what is man? A lonely creature driven<br>   Like fallen leaf, bemocked by empty words,<br>   As full of guile as basket is of birds.<br> His rottenness would swift as smoke be riven,<br>   Didst Thou his measure, not Thy measure keep.<br>   His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>
