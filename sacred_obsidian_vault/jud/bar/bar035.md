 <p>1. "With what is a beast led forth, and with what is it not led forth?" <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">2</font></a> "One may lead forth the camel with a head-stall, and the she-camel with a nose-ring, and the Lydda <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">3</font></a> asses with a bridle, and a horse with a halter, and all animals that wear a halter they may lead forth with a halter, and they are held with a halter, and, if unclean, they may sprinkle water upon them, and baptize them in their places.<font size="-1" color="green">"</font></p>  
 <p>2. The ass one may lead forth with a pack-saddle when it is bound on it. Rams go forth tied up. Ewes go forth </p>

 <p>with tails bound back, doubled down, or put in a bag. The goats go forth bound tightly. Rabbi José "forbids all, excepting ewes, to have their tails in a bag." Rabbi Judah says "the goats go forth bound tightly to dry up their udders, but not to guard the milk."</p>  
 <p>3. "And with what must they not go forth?" "A camel must not go forth with a rag bound as a mark to its tail, nor fettered, nor with fore-foot tied doubled up, and so with the rest of all beasts; a man must not bind camels one to another, and lead them, but he may take their ropes into his hand, and hold them, guarding that they be not twisted.<font size="-1" color="green">"</font> <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. One must not bring forth an ass with a pack-saddle, when it is not tied upon him <i>before the Sabbath;</i> nor with a bell, even though it be muffled, nor with a ladder <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">2</font></a> on its throat, nor with a strap on its leg; nor may cocks and hens be led forth with twine or straps on their legs. Nor may rams be led forth with a gocart under their tails, nor ewes with John wood. <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">3</font></a> And the calf must not be led forth with a muzzle, nor a cow with the skin of the hedgehog, <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor with a strap between her horns. The cow <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">5</font></a> of Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Azariah, used to go out with a strap between her horns, but not with the will of the Sages.</p>
