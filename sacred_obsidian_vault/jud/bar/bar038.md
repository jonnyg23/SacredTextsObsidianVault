Rabbi Simeon says, "all of them by the quarter log." And they did not mention these measures save for those who reserve them.</p>  
 <p>2. "Whoever brings out cord sufficient to make an ear for a tub, bulrush sufficient to hang the sieve and the riddle?" Rabbi Judah said, "sufficient to take from it the measure of a child's shoe; paper sufficient to write on it the signature of the taxgatherers; erased paper sufficient to wrap round a small bottle of balmis guilty" (of death).</p>  
 <p>3.

 <p>thick or split?" "sufficient to boil with it a hen's egg easy (to be cooked) amongst eggs, mixed with oil and put in a pan."</p>  
 <p>6. A bone sufficient to make a spoon,Rabbi Judah said, "sufficient to make the ward of a key;" glass sufficient to scrape the top of a shuttle; a lump of earth or a stone sufficient to fling at a bird; Rabbi Eliezer said, "sufficient to fling at a beast."</p>  
 <p>7. "A potsherd?" "Sufficient to put between two beams,"the words of Rabbi Judah; Rabbi Meier says, "sufficient to take away fire with it;" Rabbi José says, "sufficient to receive in it the fourth of a log." Said Rabbi Meier, Although there is no visible proof of the matter, there is an indication of the matter, as is said, there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth. <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a> Rabbi José said to him, "thence is the visible proof, 'or to take water out of the pit.'" <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
