 <p>THE CANDLESTICK which Moses made in the wilderness was wrought from gold, and required hammering, and required knops and flowers, as is said, "And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same." <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">3</font></a> "Do I hear that he shall make separate members and join them to it?" "The teaching says, that 'they shall be of the same.'" "Whence know we that it extends to the light?" "The teaching says, 'Thou shalt make.'" "I am of opinion that it should be extended to the bowls, knops, and flowers.

When it was made of gold it required a talent; when it was not of gold it did not require a talent. Rabbi Joshua the son of Korcha said, "it (the candlestick) was made of a talent, but the lights, and the tongs, and the snuff-dishes, were not from the talent," as is said, "Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it." <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">1</font></a> "And what do I establish?" "That all these vessels were vessels of pure gold. But the trumpets which Moses made in the wilderness were made of silver only, as is said, 'Make thee two trumpets of silver.'" <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
