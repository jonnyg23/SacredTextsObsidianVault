 <p>1. "A cooking oven which was heated with stubble or brushwood?" "They may place on it cookery." "With oil-dregs and with wood?" "They must not place it, till the coals are raked out, or ashes put in." The school of Shammai say, "hot water, but not cookery." But the school</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>of Hillel say, "hot water and cookery." The school of Shammai say, "they may take it off, but not place it back." But the school of Hillel say, "they may place it back."</p>  
 <p>2. "A cooking-stove, which was heated with stubble or brushwood?" "They must not place anything either inside or upon it." "A bake oven, which was heated with stubble or brushwood?" "It is as a cooking oven." "With oil-dregs or with wood?" "It is as a cooking stove."</p>  
 <p>3. They must not put an egg beside a boiler, lest it be boiled. And they must not wrap it in towels. But Rabbi José allows it. And they must not hide it in sand, or in the dust of the roads, lest it be roasted.</p>  
 <p>4. It happened that the men of Tiberias arranged, and introduced a pipe of cold water into a canal of the hot springs. The Sages said to them, "If it be Sabbath, it is as if hot waters were heated on Sabbath, they are forbidden for washing and drinking. But if on a holiday, as if hot waters were heated on a holiday, they are forbidden for washing but allowed for drinking." "A skillet with attached brazier?" "If one rake out the coals (on Friday evening), persons may drink its hot waters on Sabbath." "A pan with double bottom?" "Even though the coals are raked out, they must not drink of it."</p>  
 <p>5. "The boiler which is set aside (from the fire)?" "They must not put into it cold water to be warmed; but they may put into it,or into a cup,cold water to make it lukewarm." "A saucepan or an earthen pot, which they took off boiling?" "They must not put into it spices, but they may put them into a bowl or into a plate." Rabbi Judah says, "they may put them into all vessels, excepting a thing in which there is vinegar or fish-brine."</p>  
 <p>6. They must not put vessels under a lamp to catch the oil. "But if they place them, while it is still day?""It is allowed." But they must not use it, because it is not purposely prepared (for Sabbath use). They may remove a new lamp, but not an old one. Rabbi Simon says, "all lamps may be removed, except the lamp lighted for the Sabbath." They may put a vessel under the lamp to catch sparks, but they must not put water into it, as it quenches.</p>
