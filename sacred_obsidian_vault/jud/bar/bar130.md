 <p>1. Everything suited for causing legal uncleanness in that which is trodden must be expelled from the ceremony of purification, whether it be unclean or clean, and man likewise. "Everything suited for producing defilement of the dead, whether it be unclean or clean?" R. Eliezer said, "it is not expelled." R. Joshua said, "it is expelled." But the Sages say, "if unclean it is expelled, but the clean thing is not expelled."</p>  
 <p>2. He who is cleansed for purification, when he touches that which is expelled, is unclean. A jug for purification, when it touches that which is expelled, is unclean. He who is cleansed for purification, when he touches eatable or drinkable things with his hand, is unclean. "But with his foot?" "He is clean." "The thing was moved with his hand?" R. Joshua pronounces him "unclean;" but the Sages pronounce him "clean."</p>  
 <p>3. "An earthen vessel for purification, which touched a creeping thing?" "It is clean." "It was placed upon it?" R. Eleazar pronounces it "clean;" but the Sages pronounce it "unclean." "It touched eatable or drinkable things, or holy writings?" "It is clean." "It was placed upon them?" R. José pronounced it "clean;" but the Sages pronounced it "unclean."</p>  
 <p>4. "When he who was cleansed for purification touched a fireplace <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a> with his hand?" "He is unclean." "But with his foot?" "He is clean." "He stood on the fireplace, and stretched his hand with the jug, and the water and ashes in it beyond the fireplace, and also the shoulder pole, which he placed over the fireplace, and on it were two</p>

 <p>earthen vessels, one on either side?" R. Akiba pronounces him "clean;" <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">1</font></a> but the Sages pronounce him "unclean."</p>  
 <p>5. "He stood outside the fireplace, and stretched his hand to the window, and took the jug (with water and ashes) and passed it over the fireplace?" R. Akiba pronounces him "unclean," but the Sages pronounce him "clean." But he who was cleansed for purification, may stand over the fireplace, and in his hand an empty vessel cleansed for purification or (one) with water without ashes.</p>  
 <p>6. "When a jug for purification touched (one) in which there were holy things, or one in which there was an heave-offering?" "The one for purification is unclean; but those of the holy things and the heave-offering are clean." "If both be in his two hands?" "Both are unclean." "If both be in two papers?" "Both are clean." "If the one for purification be in paper, and the one for the heave-offering be in his hand?" "Both are unclean." "If the one for the heave-offering be in paper, and the one for purification be in his hand?" "Both are clean." R. Joshua said, "the one for the purification is unclean." "They were placed on the ground and one touched them?" "The one for purification is unclean, the one containing the holy things, and the one with the heave-offering are clean." "He moved them?" R. Joshua pronounces them "unclean," but the Sages pronounce them "clean."</p>
