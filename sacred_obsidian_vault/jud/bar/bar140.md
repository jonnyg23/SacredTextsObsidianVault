 <p>The vail was woven ten cubits square, and there were made in it four loops, and it was hung on hooks on the tops of the pillars, and it was spread in the third portion of the tabernacle, that there should be from it inwards ten cubits, and from it outwards twenty cubits, as is said, "And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches." <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">2</font></a> It follows that the place of the Holy of Holies was ten cubits square, and there were put the ark, and the pot of manna, and the pan of anointing oil, and Aaron's rod with its almonds and flowers; and there Aaron entered four times on the day of atonement. Outside the vail were placed the table and candlestick. But the table was on the north, and opposite to it was the candlestick on the south; as is said, "And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table." <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">3</font></a> And as they were placed in the tent of the congregation, so were they placed in the everlasting House. <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">4</font></a> Now the tent of the congregation was in length thirty cubits, and in breadth ten cubits. But the everlasting House was in length sixty cubits, and in breadth twenty cubits. This teaches that the tent of the congregation was one-fourth part of the everlasting House. And as the vail was woven, so was woven the ephod and the breastplate, only in these there was an additional thread of gold; as is said, "And they did beat the gold into thin plates and cut it into wires." <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">5</font></a> As was the weaving of the covering vail, so was the weaving of the covering for the entrance. But the vail was cunning work, as is said, "Thou shalt make the vail of blue and purple," etc.; "cunning work." <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">6</font></a> But the covering of the entrance was needle-work, as is said, "And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent," etc., "of needle-work." <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">7</font></a> The words of R.</p>

Nehemiah usually said, "every place where it is said cunning work (there were) two figuresin the needlework (there was) but one figure only." And the branches of the candlestick were right opposite to the breadth of the table. And the golden altar was placed in the middle of the house, and divided the house, and its half inwards was right opposite to the ark; as is said, "And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony before the mercy-seat." <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_722"><font size="1">1</font></a> From the boards on the south to the branches of the candlestick (there were) two cubits and a half. And from the branches of the candlestick to the table (there were) five cubits. And from the table to the boards on the north (were) two cubits and a half. This teaches that the breadth of the Holy place (was) ten cubits. From the boards on the west to the vail (were) ten cubits. From the vail to the table were five cubits. From the table to the golden altar (were) five cubits. From the golden altar to the boards on the east (were) ten cubits. This teaches that the length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits.</p>
