 <h2><font size="+1">Article: Articles of Faith</font></h2>
 
 <p><a name="no_fixed"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">No Fixed Dogmas</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">In the same sense as Christianity or Islam, Judaism can
 not be credited with the possession of Articles of Faith. Many attempts
 have indeed been made at systematizing and reducing to a fixed phraseology
 and sequence the contents Of the Jewish religion. But these have always
 lacked the one essential element: authoritative sanction on the part of
 a supreme ecclesiastical body. And for this reason they have not been recognized
 as final or regarded as of universally binding force. Though to a certain
 extent incorporated in the liturgy and utilized for purposes of instruction,
 these formulations of the cardinal tenets of Judaism car- ried no greater
 weight than that imparted to them by the fame and scholarship of their.respective
 authors. None of them had a character analogous to that given in the Church
 to its three great formulas (the so-called Apostles' Creed, the Nicene
 or Constantopolitan, and the Athanasian), or even to the Kalimat As-Shahadat
 of the Mohammedans. The recital of this "Kalimah" is the first
 of the five pillars of practical religion in Islam, and one converted to
 Islam must repeat it verbatim; so that among the conditions required of
 every believer with reference to confession is the duty to repeat it aloud
 at least once in a lifetime. None of the many summaries from the pens of
 Jewish philosophers) and rabbis has been invested with similar importance
 and prominence. The reasons for this relative absence of official and obligatory
 creeds are easily ascertained. </font><a name="no_need"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">No Need for Creeds in Judaism</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The remark of Leibnitz, in his preface to the "Essais
 de Theodicee," that the nations which filled the earth before the
 establishment of Christianity had ceremonies of devotion, sacrifices, libations,
 and a priesthood, but that they had no Articles of Fai th and no dogmatic
 theology, applies with slight modification to the Jews. Originally race
 -- or perhaps it is more correct to say nationality -- and religion were
 coextensive. Birth, not profession, admitted to the religio-national fellowship.
 As long as internal dissension or external attack did not necessitate for
 purposes of defense the formulation of the peculiar. and differentiating
 doctrines, the thought of paragraphing and fixing the contents of the religious
 consciousness could not insinuate itse lf into the mind of even the most
 faithful. Missionary or- proselytizing religions are driven to the definite
 declaration of their teachings. The admission of the neophyte hinges upon
 the profession and the acceptance of his part of the belief, and that t
 here may be no uncertainty about what is essential and what non-essential,
 it is incumbent on the proper authorities to determine and promulgate the
 cardinal tenets in a form that will facilitate repetition and memorizing.
 And the same necessity arises wh en the Church or religious fellowship
 is torn by internal heresies. Under the necessity of combating heresies
 of various degrees of perilousness and of stubborn insistence, the Church-
 and Islam, were forced to define and officially limit their respective
 ) theological concepts. Both of these provocations to creed-building were
 less intense in Judaism. The proselytizing zeal, though during certain
 periods more active than at others, was, on the whole, neutralized, partly
 by inherent disinclination and part ly by force of circumstances. Righteousness,
 according- to Jewish belief, was not conditioned of the acceptance of the
 Jewish religion. And the righteous among the nations that carried into
 practise the seven fundamental laws of the covenant with Noah and his descendants
 were declared to be participants in the felicity of the hereafter. This
 interpretation of the status of non-Jews precluded the development of a
 missionary attidude. Moreover, the regulations for the reception of proselytes,
 as developed i n course of time, prove the eminently practical, that is,
 the non-creedal character of Judaism. Compliance with certain rites --
 baptism, circumcision, and sacrifice -- is the test of the would-be convert's
 faith. He is instructed in the details of the le gal practise that manifests
 the Jew's religiosity, while the profession of faith demanded is limited
 to the acknowledgement of the nity of God and the rejection of idolatry
 (Yorei De'ah, Gerim , 268, 2). Judah ha-Levi ("Cuzari," i. 115)
 puts the whole mat ter very strikingly when he says: </font></p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <p><font size="+1">"We are not putting on an equality with us a person
 entering our religion through confession alone [Arabic original, <i>bikalamati</i>=by
 word]. We require deeds, including in that term self-restraint, purity,
 study of the Law, circuscision, and the performance of other duties demanded
 by the Torah."</font></p>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p><font size="+1">For the preparation of the convert, therefore, no other
 method of instruction was employed than for the training of one born a
 Jew. The aim of teaching was to convey a knowledge of he Law, obedience
 to which manifested the acceptance of the underlying re ligious principes;
 namely, the existence of God and the holiness of Israel as the people of
 his covenant. </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The controversy whether Judaism demands belief in dogma
 or inculcates obedience to practical laws alone, aas enlisted many competent
 scholars. Moses Mendelssohn, in his "Jerusalem," defended the
 non-dogmatic nature of Judaism, while Low, among others, (se e his "Gesammelte
 Schriften," i. 31-52, 433 et seq. 1871) took the opposite side. Low
 made it clear that the Mendelssohnian theory had been carried beyond its
 legitimate bounds. The meaning of the word for faithful and belief in Hebrew
 [<i>emunah</i>] had undoubtedly been strained too far to substantiate the
 Mendelssohnian thesis. Underlying the practise of the Law was assuredly
 the recognition of certain fundamental and decisive religious principles
 culminating in the belief in God and revelation, and li kewise in the doctrine
 of retributive divine justice. </font><a name="evolution"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">Evolution of Judaism</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The modern critical view of the development of the Pentateuch
 within the evolution of Israel's monotheism confirms this theory. The controversy
 of the Prophets hinges on the adoption by the people of Israel of the religion
 of YHVH, th at excluded froin the outset idolatry, or certainly the recognition
 of any other deity than YHVH as the legitimate Lord of Israel; that, in
 its progressive evolution, associated YHVH the concepts of holiness, ju
 stice, and righteousness; and that which culminated in the teaching of
 God's spirituality and universality. The historical books of the Bible,
 as recast in accordance with these latter religious ideas evince the force
 of a strong and clearly apprehended conviction concerning the providential
 purpose in the destinies of earth's inhabitants, and more especially in
 the guidance of Israel. </font><a name="discussion"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">Discussions and Dogmatism Disfavored</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The Psalms and Wisdom books manifest the predominance,
 of definite religious beliefs. To say that Judaism is a barren legalistic
 convention, as Mendelssohn avers, is an unmistakable exaggeration. The
 modicum of truth in his theory is that throughout Bi blical Judaism, as
 in fact throught all later phases of Jewish religious thinking and practise,
 this doctrinal element remains always in solution. It is not crystallized
 into fixed phraseology or rigid dogma. And, moreover, the ethical and practical
 impli cations of the religion are never obscured. This is evidenced by
 the Biblical passages that, in the opinion of many, partake of the nature
 of Articles of Faith, or are of great value as showing what, in the opinion
 of their respective authors, constitutes the essence of religion. Among
 these the most noteworthy are Deut. vi. 4; Isa., xlv. 5-7; Micah vi. 8;
 Ps. xv. ; Isa. i. 16, 17; xxxiii. 15. </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">Whatever controversies may have agitated Israel during
 the centuries of the Prophets and the earlier postexilic period, they were
 not of a kind to induce the defining of Articles of Faith counteract the
 influences of heretical teaching. Dogmatic influe nces manifest themselves
 only after the Maccabean struggle for independence. But even these differences
 were not far-reaching enough to overcome the inherent aversion to dogmatic
 fixation of principles; for, with the Jews, acceptance of principles was
 not so much a matter of theoretical assent as of practical conduct. Though
 Josephus would have the divisions between the Pharisees and the Sadducees
 hinge on the formal acceptance or rejection of certain points of doctrine
 -- such as Providence, resurrectio n of the body, which for the Pharisees,
 was identical with future retribution -- it is the consensus of opinion
 among modern scholars that the differences between these two parties were
 rooted in their respective political programs, and implied in their respectively
 national and anti-national attitudes, rather than in their philosophical
 or religious dogmas. </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">If the words of Sirach (iii. 20-23) are to be taken as
 a criterion, the intensely pious of his days did not incline to speculations
 of what was beyond their powers to comprehend. They were content to perform
 their, religious duties in simplicity of fai th. The Mishnah (Hag. 11.
 1) indorsed this view of Sirach, and in some degree, discountenanced theosophy
 and dogmatism. Among the recorded discussions in the schools of the Rabbis,
 dogmatic problems commanded only a very inferior degree of attention ('Er.
 13b: controversy concerning the, value of human life; Hag. 12a: concerning
 the order of Creation). Nevertheless, in the earliest Mishnah is found
 the citation of Abtalion against heresy and unbelief (Ab. i. 11 [12]);
 and many a Baraita betrays the preva lence of religious differences (Ber.
 12b; 'Ab. Zarah 17a). These controversies have left their impress upon
 the prayer-book and the liturgy. This is shown by the prominence given
 to the Shema'; to the Messianic predictions in the Shemoneh-'Esreh (the
 "Ei ghteen Benedictions"), which emphasized the belief in the
 Resurrection; and, finally, to the prominence given to the Decalogue --
 though the latter was again omitted in order to counteract the belief that
 it alone had been revealed (Tamid v. 1; Yer. Ber. 6b; Bab. Ber. 12a). These
 expressions of belief are held to have originated in the desire to give
 definite utterance and impressiveness to the corresponding doctrines that
 were either rejected or attenuated by some of the heretical schools. But
 while the se portions of the daily liturgy are expressive of the doctrinal
 contents of the regnant party in the synagogue (see Landshuth, in Edelman's
 "Hegyon Leb"; and L</font><font size="-1">ITURGY</font><font size="+1">),
 they were not cast into the form of catalogued Articles of Faith. </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The first to make the attempt to formulate them was <a name="philo"></a>Philo
 of Alexandria. The influence of Greek thought induced among the Jews of
 Egypt the reflective mood. Discussion was undoubtedly active on the unsettled
 points of speculative be lief; and such discussion led, as it nearly always
 does, to a stricter definition of the doctrines. In his work "De Mundi
 Opificio," lxi., Philo enumerates five articles as embracing the chief
 tenets of Mosaism: </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ol>
 <li><font size="+1">God is and rules; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God is one; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the world was created; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">Creation is one; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God's providence rules Creation. </font></li>
 </ol>
 
 <p><br>
 <a name="talmudic"></a><font size="+1">But among the Tannaim and Amoraim
 this example of Philo found no followers, though many of their number were
 drawn into controversies with both Jews and non-Jews, and had to fortify
 their faith against the attacks of contemporaneous philosophy as well as
 against rising Christianity. Only in a general way the Mishnah Sanh. xi.
 1 excludes from the world to come the Epicureans and those who deny belief
 in resurrection or in the divine origin of the Torah. R. Akiba would also
 regard as heretical the readers o f <i>Sefarim Hetsonim</i> -- certain
 extraneous writings (Apocrypha or Gospels) -- and such persons that would
 heal through whispered formulas of magic. Abba Saul designated as under
 suspicion of infidelity those that pronounce the ineffable name of the
 D eity. By implication, the contrary doctrine and attitude may thus be
 regarded as having been proclaimed as orthodox. On the other hand, Akiba
 himself declares that the command to love one's neighbor the fundamental
 the principle of the Law; while Ben Asa i assigns this distinction to the
 Biblical verse, "This is the book of the generations of man "
 (Gen. v. i.; Gen. R. xxiv). The definition of Hillel the Elder in his interview
 with a would-be convert (Shab. 31a), embodies in the golden rule the one
 fundam ental article of faith. A teacher of the third Christian century,
 R. Simlai, traces the development of Jewish religious principles from Moses
 with his 613 commands of prohibition and injunction, through David, who,
 according to this rabbi, enumerates ele ven; through Isaiah, with six;
 Micah, with three; to Habakkuk who simply but impressively sums up all
 religious faith in the single phrase, " The pious lives in his faith"
 (Mak., toward end). As the Halakhah enjoins that one should prefer death
 to an act of idolatry, incest, unchastity, or murder, the inference is
 plain that the corresponding positive principles were held to be fundamental
 articles of Judaism. </font><a name="decalogue"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">The Decalogue as a Summary</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">From Philo down to late medieval and even modern writers,
 the Decalogue has been held to be in some way a summary of both the articles
 of the true faith and the duties derived from that faith. According to
 the Alexandrian philosopher (see "De Vita Mos is") the order
 of the Ten Words is not accidental. They divide readily into two groups:
 the first five summarizing man's relations to the Deity; the other five
 specifying man's dutics to his fellows. Ibn Ezra virtually adopts this
 view. He interprets the contents of the Decalogue, not merely in their
 legal-ritual bearing but as expressive of ethico-religious principles.
 But this view can be traced to other traditions. In Yer. Ber. 6b the Shema'
 is declared to be only an epitome of the Decalogue. That in the poetry
 of the synagogal ritual this thought often dominates is well known. No
 less a thinker than Saadia Gaon composed a liturgical production of this
 character (see A</font><font size="-1">ZHAROT</font><font size="+1">) and R.
 Eliezer ben Nathan of Mayence enriched the pray er-book with a piyyut in
 which the six hundred and thirteen commands are rubricated in the order
 of and in connection with the Decalogue. The theory that the Decalogue
 was the foundation of Judaism, its article of faith, was advocated Isaac
 Abravanel (see his Commentary on Ex. xx. 1); and in recent years by Isaac
 M. Wise of Cincinnati in his "Catechism" and other writings.
 </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The only confession of faith, however, which, though not
 so denominated, has found universal acceptance, forms a part of the daily
 liturgy, contained in all Jewish prayer-books. ln its original form it
 read somewhat as follows: </font></p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <p><font size="+1">"True and established is this word for us forever.
 True it is that Thou art our God as Thou wast the God of our fathers; our
 King as [Thou wast] the King of our fathers; our Redeemer and the Redeemer
 of our fathers; our Creator and the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer
 and Savior -- from eternity is Thy name, and there is no God besides Thee."</font></p>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p><font size="+1">This statement dates probably from the days of the Hasmoneans
 (see Landshuth, in "Hegyon Leb"). </font><a name="saadia"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">Saadia's, Judah ha-Levi's and Bahya's Creed.</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">In the stricter sense of the term, specifications in connected
 sequence, and rational analysis of Articles of Faith, did not find favor
 with the teachers and the faithful before the Arabic period. The polemics
 with the Karaites on the one hand, and, on the other, the necessity of
 defending their religion against the attacks of the philosophies current
 among both Mohammedans and Jews, induced the leading thinkers to define
 and formulate their beliefs. Saadia's "Emunot we-Deot" is in
 reality one long ex position of the main tenets of the faithful. The plan
 of the book discloses a systematization of the different religious doctrines
 that, in the estimation of the author, constitute the sum total of his
 faith. They are, in the order of ther treatment by hi m, the following:
 </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ol>
 <li><font size="+1">The world is created; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God is one and incorporeal; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in revelation (including the divine origin of
 tradition; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">man is called to righteousness and endowed with all necessary
 qualities of mind and sould to avoid sin; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in reward and punishment; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the soul is created pure; after death it leaves the body;
 </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in resurrection; </font><br>
 </li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">Messianic expectation, retribution, and final judgment.
 </font></li>
 </ol>
 
 <p><font size="+1">Judah ha-Levi endeavored, in his "Cuzari," to
 determine the fundamentcals of Judaism on another basis. He rejects all
 appeal to speculative reason, repudiating the method of the Motekallamin.
 The miracles and traditions are, in their natural character, both the source
 and the evidence of the true faith. With them Judaism stands and falls.
 The book of Bahya ibn Pakuda ("Hobot ha-Lebabot"), while remarkable,
 as it is, for endeavoring to give religion its true setting as a spiritual
 force, contributed not hing of note to the exposition of the fundamental
 articles. It goes without saying that the unity of God, His government
 of the world,, the possibilities of leading a divine life -- which were
 never forfeited by man -- are expounded as essentials of Judai sm. </font><a name="ibn_daud"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">Ibn Daud and Hananel ben Hushiel</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">More interesting on this point is the work of R. Abraham
 ibn Daud (1120) entitled " Emnah Ramah" (The High Faithful).
 In the second division of his treatise he discourses on the principles
 of faith and the Law. These principles are: </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ul>
 <li><font size="+1">The existence of God; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His Unity; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His spirituality; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His other attributes; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His power as manifested in His works; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His providence. </font></li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><br>
 <font size="+1">Less well known is the scheme of an African rabbi, Hananel
 b. Hushiel, about a century earlier, according to whom Judaism's fundamental
 articles number four: </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ul>
 <li><font size="+1">Belief in God; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in prophecy; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in a future state; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in the advent of the Messiah. </font></li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><a name="thirteen"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">The Thirteen Articles of Maimonides</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The most widely spread and popular of all creeds is that
 of Maimonides, embracing the thirteen articles. Why he chose this particular
 number has been a subject of much discussion. Some have seen in the number
 a reference to the thirteen attributes of God. Probably no meaning attaches
 to the choice of the number. His articles are:</font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ol>
 <li><font size="+1">The existence of God; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His unity; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His spirituality; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">His eternity; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God alone the object of worship; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">Revelation through his prophets; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the preeminence of Moses among the Prophets; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God's law given on Mount Sinai; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the immutability of the Torah as God's Law; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God's foreknowledge of men's actions; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">retribution; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the coming of the Messiah; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">Resurrection. </font></li>
 </ol>
 
 <p><font size="+1">This creed Maimonides wrote while still a very young man;
 it forms a part of his Mishnah Commentary, but he never referred to it
 in his later works (See S/ Adler, "Tenets of Faith and Their Authority
 in the Talmud," in his "Kobez 'al Yad," p. 92, wher e Yad
 ha-Hazakah, Issure Biah, xiv, 2, is referred to as proof that Maimonides
 in his advanced age regarded as fundamental of the faith only the unity
 of God and the prohibition of idolatry). It did not meet universal acceptance;
 but, as its phraseology is succinct, it has passed into the the prayer-book,
 and is therefore familiar to almost all Jews of the Orthodox school. The
 successors of Maimonides, from the thirteenth to the fifteeneth century
 -- Nahmanides , Abba Mari ben Moses, Simon ben Zemah, Du ran, Albo, Isaac
 Arama, and Joseph Jaabez -- reduced his thirteen articles to three: <br>
 <br>
 Belief in </font></p>
 
 <ul>
 <li><font size="+1">God; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">in Creation (or revelation); and in </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">providence (or retribution). </font></li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><font size="+1">Others, like Crescas and David ben Samuel Estella, spoke
 of seven fundmental articles, laying stress on free-will. On the other
 hand, David ben Yom-Tob ibn Bilia, in his "Yesodot ha- Maskil"
 (Fundamentals of the Thinking Man), adds to the thirteen of M aimonides
 thirteen of his own -- a number which a contemporary of Albo (see "'Ikkarim,"
 iii.) also chose for his fundamentals; while Jedaiah Penini, in the last
 chapter of his "Behinat ha-Dat," enumerated no less than thirty-five
 cardinal principles (see Low, "Judische Dogmen," in his "Gesammelte
 Werke," i. 156 <i>et seq.</i>; and Schechter, "Dogmas of Judaism,"
 in "Studies of Judaism," pp. 147-181). </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">In the fourteenth century Asher ben Jehiel of Toledo raised
 his voice against the Maimonidean Articles of Faith, declaring them to
 be only temporary, and suggested that another be added to recognize that
 the Exile is a punishment for the sins of Israel . Isaac Abravanel, his
 "Rosh Amanah," took the same attitude towards Maimonides' creed.
 While defending Maimonides against Hasdai and Albo, he refused to accept
 dogmatic articles for Judaism, holding, with all the cabalists, that the
 613 commandments of t he Law are all tantamount to Articles of Faith. </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">In liturgical poetry the Articles of Faith as evolved
 by philosophical speculation met with metrical presentation. The most noted
 of such metrical and rimed elaborations are the "Adon 'Olam,"
 by an anonymous writer -- now used as an introduction to the morning services
 (by the Sephardim as the conclusion of the <i>musaf</i> or "additional"
 service), and of comparatively recent date; and the other known as the
 "Yigdal," according to Luzzatto, by R. Daniel b. Judah Dayyan.
 </font><a name="modern"></a></p>
 
 <h2><font size="+1">Modern Catechisms</font></h2>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The modern catechisms abound in formulated Articles of
 Faith. These are generally intended to be recited by the candidates for
 confirmation, or to be used for the reception of proselytes (See Dr. Einhorn's
 "'Olat Tamid"). The Central Conference of America n Rabbis, in
 devising a formula for the admission of proselytes, elaborated a set of
 Articles of Faith. These modern schemes have not met with general favor
 -- their authors being in almost all cases the only ones that have had
 recourse to them in practis e. The points of agreement in these recent
 productions consist in </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ul>
 <li><font size="+1">the affirmation of the unity of God; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the electionof Israel as the priest people; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the Messianic destiny of all humanity. </font></li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The declaration of principles by the Pittsburgh Conference
 (1885) is to be classed, perhaps, with the many attempts to fix in a succinct
 enumeration the main principles of the modern Jewish religi ous consciousness.
 </font></p>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The Karaites are not behind the Rabbinites in the elaboration
 of Articles of Faith. The oldest instances of the existence of such articles
 among them are found in the famous word by Judah ben Elijah Hadassi, "Eshkol
 ha-Kofer." In the order there given these are the articles of the
 Karaite: </font><br>
 </p>
 
 <ol>
 <li><font size="+1">God is the Creator of all created beings; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">He is premundane and has no peer or associate; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the whole universe is created; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">God called Moses and the other Prophets of the Biblical
 canon; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the Law of Moses alone is true; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">to know the language of the Bible is a religious duty;
 </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">the Temple at Jerusalem is the palace of the world's
 ruler; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">belief in Resurrection contemporaneous with the advent
 of the Messiah; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">final judgment; </font></li>
 
 <li><font size="+1">retribution. </font></li>
 </ol>
 
 <p><font size="+1">The number ten here is not accidental. It is keeping with
 the scheme of the Decalogue. Judah Hadassi acknowledges that he had predecessors
 in this line, and mentions some of the works on which he bases his enumeration.
 The most succinct cataloguing of the Karaite faith in articles is that
 by Elijah Bashyatzi (died about 1490). His articles vary but little from
 those by Hadassi, but they are put with greater philosophical precision
 (see Jost, Geschichte des Judenthums," ii. 331). </font><a name="bibliography"></a></p>
