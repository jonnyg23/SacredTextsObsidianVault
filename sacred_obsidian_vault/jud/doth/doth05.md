 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Three</span> gates the Creator has opened to mankind, so that they may enter into the domain of spirituality, ethical conduct and the laws divine, that guide us in our works and daily life to health of body and of mind and soul. The first is the lofty portal of pure Reason, with all obstructing errors cleared away; the second is the book of the Torah, <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">*</font></a> revealed to Moses, the prophet; the third is built up of traditions.</p>
