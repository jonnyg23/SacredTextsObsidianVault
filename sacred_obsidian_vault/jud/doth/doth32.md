 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> who is humble before God should be meek and modest in all the affairs of the world; both in what is seen and in what is secret; in his speech and in his actions; in his bodily activities, and when at rest; and what is in his heart and mind must not be the opposite to what is manifest about him; and all his actions must be well pondered and suitable, equal, equable, and constant, and must tend in the direction of humility and lowliness, both towards God and man . . . and our sages say, <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">*</font></a> "Be lowly of spirit in the presence of every man."</p>
