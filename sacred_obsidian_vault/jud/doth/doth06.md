 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> wisdom of the <i>Torah</i> <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="doth05.htm#fn_2"><font size="1">*</font></a> is divided into two parts:</p>  
 <p>I. The wisdom of the visible, that enables us to know the duties of the body and its members; and these include not only all the practical obligations</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>both of ethics and religion, but also all the physical obligations and restraints of a good and moral life.</p>  
 <p>II. The Duties of the Heart and Mind; duties that concern thought and feeling, and whose fulfilment is entirely in the hidden depths of the human heart and soul, and this is the wisdom of the invisible.</p>  
 <p>The duties of the heart and mind have all of them their roots in human reason, and, like some corporeal duties, would be recognised as binding even without revelation.</p>
