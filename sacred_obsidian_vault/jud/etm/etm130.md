 <p>§ 1. A widow must be maintained out of the property of the orphans, <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">1</font></a> and her earnings belong to them; and they are not bound to [defray the cost of] her funeral. Her heirs, who inherit her Ketubah, are bound to [defray the cost of] her funeral.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. A widow, whether [she become such] after betrothment only, or after [actual] marriage, may sell <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">2</font></a> without applying to the Bethdin. R. Simeon saith, "[A widow] after actual marriage, may sell without applying to the Bethdin; <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">3</font></a> but [a widow] after betrothment [only], must not sell, without [previous application to] the Bethdin, because she [the last named] is not entitled to her maintenance [out of the husband's estate]; and any woman who is not entitled to a maintenance, must not sell, without [previous application to] the Bethdin."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Should she have sold, mortgaged, or given away [to the whole amount of] her Ketubah, or [to] a part thereof, she must not sell the remainder, <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">4</font></a> without [previous application to] the Bethdin; but the sages hold, "She may make four or five different sales <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">5</font></a> [if] she sells for her necessary maintenance, [and she may do it] without [previous application to] the Bethdin. [In that case, however] she inserts [in the deed of sale], 'I make this sale for my [necessary] maintenance.' A divorced woman must not sell without [applying to] the Bethdin."</p>  
 <p>§ 4. Should a widow, whose Ketubah is two hundred dinar, sell part of the land liable to her Ketubah [to] the value of one hundred dinar for two hundred, or [to] the value of two hundred dinar for one hundred, [in either case it is held that] she has received the full amount of her Ketubah. <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">6</font></a> Should her Ketubah be one hundred dinar,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></a></p>  
 <p>and she has sold to the amount of one hundred and one dinar, the sale is void; even though she offers to make good the one dinar to the orphans, her sale is void. <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">7</font></a> R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Her sale is always valid, <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">8</font></a> unless she thereby prevents the orphans from having a field of nine kab seed corn, or a garden of half a kab seed corn." According to R. Akivah, "[A garden of] one-quarter kab seed corn." <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">9</font></a> Should her Ketubah amount to four hundred dinar, and she sells to one a hundred dinar worth, and to another a hundred dinar worth, and to the last purchaser she sells to the value of one hundred and one dinar for one hundred, her last sale is void, but all her preceding sales are valid.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. Should a judicial appraisement be made either one-sixth too high, or one-sixth too low, the sale [made in consequence of such valuation] is void; but R. Simeon ben Gamaliel maintains "That the sale is valid, for if it were otherwise, what would be the good of judicial authority? <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">10</font></a> But if they [the Bethdin] make public advertisement [of the land to be sold], even though they sold what was actually worth one hundred dinar for two hundred, or what was [actually] worth two hundred dinar for one hundred, their sale is valid."</p>  
 <p>§ 6. She who refuses [to cohabit with her husband], <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">11</font></a> or [who is related to him in] the secondary [degree of consanguinity], <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">12</font></a> or an ‏אילונית‎, <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">13</font></a> are not entitled to any Ketubah, or [compensation for] usufruct, <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">14</font></a> or maintenance or [compensation for] wear and tear. <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">15</font></a> If at the time of marriage he [the husband] knew that she [the bride] was an ‏אילונית‎, she is entitled to her Ketubah. A widow [married] to a high priest; a divorced woman, or one who has performed [the ceremony of] <i>Chalitza</i>, <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">16</font></a> [married] to an ordinary priest; a bastardess,</p>

 <p>or Nethineth <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_950"><font size="1">17</font></a> [married] to an Israelite; or a daughter of Israel married to a bastard or Nethin, are all entitled to their Ketubah.</p>
