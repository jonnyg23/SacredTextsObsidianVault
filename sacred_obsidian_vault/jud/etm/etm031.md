 <p>§ 1. R. Akivah saith, "Whence is it [to be inferred] that carrying an idol maketh unclean, even as menstruation doth? From the text, 'Thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth: thou shalt say unto it [the idol], get thee hence.' <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">1</font></a> Even as the carrying of a menstruous cloth defileth, so does likewise the carrying of an idol."</p>

 <p>§ 2. Whence is it [to be inferred] that a ship is clean? From the text, "The way of a ship in the heart [midst] of the sea." <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">2</font></a> Whence is it [to be inferred] that in a garden-bed, six hands square, five different kinds of seed may be sown; [i.e.] four [kinds] in the four corners of the garden-bed, and the fifth in the middle? <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">3</font></a> From the text, "For as the earth, bringeth forth her bud, and the garden causeth ‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, her seeds, to spring forth." <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">4</font></a> The text does not say, ‏זַרְעָהּ‎ [her seed, in the singular, as if of one kind only], but ‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, [her seeds of various kinds].</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Whence is it [to be inferred] that a woman who sheds semen on the third day [after coition] is unclean? From the text, "And be ye ready against the third day." <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">5</font></a> Whence is it [to be inferred] that a circumcised infant is to be bathed [washed] on the third day [after circumcision], even though that falls on the Sabbath? From the text, "And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore," <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">6</font></a> Whence is it [to be inferred] that a red string is to be tied to the head of the scapegoat? <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">7</font></a> From the text, "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall become white as snow." <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 4. Whence is it [to be inferred] that anointing is [as unlawful] as drinking on the day of atonement? Although there is no [absolute proof] for this assertion, there is an indication thereof in the text, "Let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones." <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 5. He [is likewise guilty] who carries out wood sufficient to boil a light egg, spices sufficient to season a light egg; and [different kinds of spice are to be] computed together. Nut-shells, pomegranate peels, isatis [woad], and madder, sufficient to dye a small cap-cloth; urine, alum, ‏בורית‎, and ‏קמוליא‎ and ‏אשלג‎, <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">10</font></a> sufficient to wash a small cap-cloth. R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to pass over a blood-stain, [by way of experiment to see if it can be taken out]."</p>  
 <p>§ 6. Pimento the smallest quantity, extract of pitch the smallest quantity; all kinds of spice [perfumes] and of metals [ores] the smallest quantity. Altar stones and altar dust, <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">11</font></a> fragments of rolls of</p>

 <p>the law, and fragments of their wrappers [gnawed to pieces by moths] the smallest quantity; because these things are preserved to be secreted. R. Jehudah saith, also, "whoever carries out the smallest quantity of what has been used for idol-worship; for it is said, 'And there shall cleave nought of the accursed thing to thine hand.'" <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>If a man carry out the box of a dealer in spices [apothecary], although there be various kinds [of spice] therein, he is [only] bound to bring one sin-offering. Garden seeds, [rather] less than the size of a dried fig. R. Jehudah ben Bethera saith, "Five [things there are of which, should a man carry the smallest quantity, he is guilty], cucumber seeds two [grains],pumpkin seeds two [grains],Egyptian bean-seed [two grains], a clean <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">13</font></a> live grasshopper any portion [however small], [if it be] dead the size of a dried fig. A vineyard bird <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">14</font></a> any [the smallest] portion [be it] dead or alive." R. Jehudah saith, "He likewise [is guilty]who carries out any [the smallest] portion of an unclean live grasshopper, because these are preserved for children to play with."</p>

Dr. Jost asserts, that ‏בורית‎ is alkaline salt; that ‏אשלג‎, derived from ‏שלג‎, snow, is a kind of frothy soap; and that ‏קמוליא‎ is the creta-cimolia, of which Pliny states (Hist. Nat. lib. v. 57), that it is used for washing.</p>
