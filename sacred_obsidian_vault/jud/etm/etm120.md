 <p>§ 1. A virgin is espoused on the fourth day [of the week], a widow on the fifth; because in towns the Bethdin sits twice a week, [namely] on the second and on the fifth [day], so that should he [the bridegroom] have to complain of non-virginity, he [presents himself] early [the next morning] before the Bethdin.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. [If the person espoused is] a virgin, her Ketubah is two</p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></a></p>  
 <p>hundred dinar; [if] a widow, [it is] a maneh. <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">2</font></a> A virgin [who is] a widow, or divorced, or has performed chalitza, after betrothment [only, the marriage ceremony not having been completed, or the marriage consummated, in all such cases] their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_780"><font size="1">3</font></a> A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at less than three years and one day [old], their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. A minor, <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_781"><font size="1">4</font></a> with whom an adult [male] has had carnal intercourse, a nubile maiden who has had such intercourse with a minor, <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">5</font></a> and [a virgin] fractured by accident, <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">6</font></a> their Ketubah is two hundred dinar. Such is the dictum of R. Meir: but the sages hold [in the case of a virgin] fractured by accident [that] her Ketubah [is only a] maneh.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. A virgin [who is] a widow or divorced, or has performed chalitza after espousals [only, the ceremony having been completed, but the marriage not consummated, in all such cases] their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at more than three years and one day [old], their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. He who in Judea has partaken [of the betrothment meal] at his father-in-law's without [any] witness [present], cannot prefer an accusation of non-virginity, because he was alone with her <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">7</font></a> [the bride]. A widow, whether she be [the daughter] of an Israelite or of a priest has [always] her Ketubah [of] a maneh. The sacerdotal</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Bethdin fixed the Ketubah for a virgin [of sacerdotal race] at four hundred zooz, but the sages did not [interfere to] prevent them.</p>  
 <p>§ 6. He who espouses a wife, and discovers she has not her virginity, should she say, "After thou didst betroth me ‏נאנסתי זנסתפחה שדך‎" <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">8</font></a> while he replies, "No, it is not so, but before I had betrothed thee [thou hadst lost thy virginity], consequently my bargain [with thee] was concluded in error:" <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">9</font></a> [in his case] R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is worthy of belief;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered previous to her betrothment, and that she deceived him, unless she adduces proof to [support her assertion]."</p>  
 <p>§ 7. Should she assert, "I have been fractured by accident," while he replies, "No, thou hast been deflowered by a man," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered by a man, unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
 <p>§ 8. If she is seen conversing [intimately] with a man in the street, and being asked, "Who is that man?" she replies, "He is A.B., a priest [or of legitimate Israelitish descent]," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">10</font></a> by a nethin or a bastard, <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">11</font></a> unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
 <p>§ 9. If she is pregnant, and being asked, "by whom?" she replies, "By NN., who is a priest," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">12</font></a> but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to be pregnant by a nethin or a bastard, unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
 <p>§ 10. R. José said, "It [once] happened that a girl went down</p>

 <p>to draw water from the fountain, and she was violated [by a person unknown]." R. Jochanan ben Nouri decided, "That if the majority of the townsmen were [of pure descent and] qualified to intermarry with the sacerdotal race, this girl might be espoused by a priest."</p>
