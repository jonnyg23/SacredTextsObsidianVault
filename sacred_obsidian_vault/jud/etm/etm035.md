 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>  
 <p>§ 1. R. Eleazar saith, "Whoever weaves three threads at the [first] beginning [of a weft], or one thread while the weft is in progress, is guilty;" but the sages decide, "that whether at the first beginning or end [of a weft] the prescribed quantity is two threads."</p>  
 <p>§ 2. Whoever ties two threads, whether in the warp or in the shoot, or in a fine or coarse sieve, or in a basket, is guilty. [Moreover], he who sews two stitches, or tears, with intent to sew two stitches, [is guilty].</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Whoever tears something in a rage, or at a death, and all who in a passion spoil [or destroy], are absolved. Whoever spoils [breaks] in order to repair the prescribed quantity, [which decides his being guilty], is [guilty] according to the [extent of the necessary] repairs.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. The prescribed quantity of wool, washed, carded, dyed, or spun, is that of a double sit; <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">1</font></a> and, in the weaving of two threads, the prescribed quantity is that of one sit in width.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. R Jehudah saith, "Whoever hunts a bird into a cage, or a deer into a house, is guilty." The sages decide, "a bird into a cage, a deer into a house, a court, or an inclosure for animals." <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">2</font></a> R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Not all inclosures are alike." The rule is, when the capture is incomplete, he is absolved; but when the capture is not incomplete he is guilty. The meaning is, whatsoever must be chased a second time renders guilty; whatsoever is completely in a man's power does not render guilty.</p>  
 <p>§ 6. If a stag enter a house, and one man shuts him in, he is guilty; if two shut him in, they are absolved; if one man is not able to shut him in, and [therefore] two shut him in, they are guilty. <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">3</font></a> R. Simeon absolves them.</p>  
 <p>§ 7. If one man places himself in the door [entry, to prevent the deer from getting out again], but does not [completely] fill it, and a second person places [himself next to him], and does fill it, the second is guilty. If the first places himself in the door [entry], and fills it, and a second person comes and places himself at his side,</p>

 <p>although the first should afterwards get up and go away [leaving the second in the entry], the first is guilty, and the second is absolved. For what is this like? Like as if he had locked his house to secure his property, and a stag is found secured within it.</p>
