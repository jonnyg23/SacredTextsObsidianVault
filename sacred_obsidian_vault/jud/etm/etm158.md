 <p>§ 1. It is prohibited to boil any kind of flesh <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">1</font></a> in milk, except that of locusts <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">2</font></a> and fish; neither may meat and cheese be brought to</p>

 <p>table together, except locusts and fish. A person who vowed not to eat meat, may eat locusts and fish. Fowl and cheese may, according to Beth Shammai, be brought to table together, but may not be eaten together; but, according to Beth Hillel, they may neither be brought to table nor be eaten together. R. José saith, "This is one of the cases in which Beth Shammai decide in a less rigid manner than Beth Hillel." <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">3</font></a> What kind of table is here alluded to? The table on which the person is eating; but on the table on which food is prepared [a dresser], both kinds may without apprehension be placed near to each other.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. Meat and cheese may be wrapped up together in one cloth, if they do not touch each other [i.e. are placed in contact]. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Two guests [at an inn or ordinary] may without apprehension eat at the same table, one of them meat, and the other cheese."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. When a drop of milk fell upon a piece of meat [in a pan], all the meat therein is prohibited if it could have communicated its flavor to the meat; <a name="fr_1250"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">4</font></a> but if the contents of the pot had been immediately stirred together [after the milk fell into it]: if it imparted its flavor to the whole, the contents of the pot are prohibited. The udder [of a cow or goat, &amp;c.] must be torn, and the milk be pressed out of it; but if it had not been torn, the person who eats it has not transgressed; the heart must also be torn and the blood pressed out. If it had not been torn, the person who eats it thus has not transgressed; <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">5</font></a> and he who has fowl and cheese brought to table together has not transgressed the negative commandment.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. It is prohibited to boil [in milk] or to derive any benefit from the flesh of a clean animal which was boiled in milk of a clean animal, but it is permitted to boil and to reap advantage of flesh of a clean animal boiled in the milk of an unclean one, or, of the flesh of an unclean animal boiled in the milk of a clean one. R. Akivah saith,</p>

 <p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="green">p. 346</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "Wild animals and fowl are not specified in the law [as subject to this prohibition]; for it is said, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk,' but this precept was mentioned three times, <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">6</font></a> to include wild animals, fowl, and unclean animals. R. José the Galilean saith, "It is said [Deut. xiv. 21], 'Thou shalt not eat of any thing that dieth of itself' [Nebelah], and it is added immediately, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.' Consequently, those animals only which are prohibited as <i>Nebelah</i> may not be boiled in milk, and as it might be supposed that since a fowl may become prohibited as <i>Nebelah</i>, it would therefore be prohibited to boil it in milk, the Scripture uses the expression, 'in its <i>mother's milk</i>,' to except fowl, to which that expression cannot apply." <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 5. It is prohibited to use the curdled milk in the maw of an animal slaughtered by a non-Israelite, which is <i>Nebelah</i>. When a person put milk in the interior membrane of the maw <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">8</font></a> of a Cashér killed animal; <a name="fr_1255"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">9</font></a> if the milk can impart a flavor to it, it is prohibited. The milk in the maw of a Cashér animal, which sucked from one that is Terefá, is prohibited; but the milk of a Terefá, which sucked from a Cashér animal, may be used, because the milk remains gathered [enclosed] in the intestines. <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 6. Several laws are more rigid in respect to the prohibition of eating suet [‏חלב‎] than they are in that against eating blood, and some, again, which relate to this latter prohibition, are more severe than those in respect to the first mentioned. More severe in respect to suet, inasmuch as a trespass [‏מעילה‎] may be thereby incurred, as also the guilt of having brought an abominable [i.e. unfit] sacrifice [‏פגול‎], and having eaten of what remained <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">11</font></a> [‏נותר‎], and became unclean, which is not the case in respect to the blood. Some laws are more severe as regards blood, since this prohibition applies to the blood of domestic and wild animals, and also to fowl, whether they are of a clean or unclean species, but that against eating suet applies to clean animals exclusively.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1244"></a><a href="etm158.htm#fr_1249">345:3</a> The contrary is generally the case, Beth Hillel being mostly less rigid in their decisions than Beth Shammai.</p>
