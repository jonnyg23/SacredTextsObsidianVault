 <p>§ 1. Whoever carries out wine sufficient to mix a goblet [of wine], <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">1</font></a> [such as is used at grace after meat], milk equal to a mouthful, honey sufficient to spread upon a sore, oil sufficient to anoint a small limb [joint], water sufficient to form a colyrium [wash for one eye], or of any other kind of beverage, quarter of a lug, and also of whatever can be poured out [liquids], quarter of a lug. R. Simeon saith, "For all [the articles here enumerated] the legal quantity is one quarter lug; and the [various] quantities here specified are only for those who conserve [keep the articles].</p>  
 <p>§ 2. Whoever carries out rope sufficient to make a handle for a box, [basket], or reed sufficient to make a hook for [whereon to hang] a fine, or a coarse sieve; R. Jehudah saith, "Sufficient to take measure for a child's shoe, paper sufficient to write thereon a toll-bill <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and, [lastly, whoever carries out] a toll-bill of blotted paper, sufficient, to wrap a small balm flask therein, is guilty."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Vellum sufficient for an amulet, [double wove parchment sufficient to write a mezoozah thereon], single wove parchment sufficient to write thereon the smallest section [parashah] of the Tephilin, which is ‏שמע ישראל‎, ink sufficient to write two letters, paint sufficient to dye one eye. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 4. Bird-lime sufficient to put on the top of the lime twig; pitch, or sulphur, sufficient to fill up a tube of quicksilver; wax sufficient to stop up a small leak [in a wine cask]; loam sufficient to make an</p>

 <p>orifice [for a bellows], or the crucible of a gold refiner. R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to make a stand [for such a crucible], lime sufficient to cover the little finger of a maiden." R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to cover one of her temples." R. Nehemiah saith, "sufficient to anoint one of her temples [withal]." <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 5. Red loam sufficient to seal a bale of goods. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages hold, "sufficient to seal a letter therewith." Dung, or fine sand, sufficient to manure a cabbage-stalk. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages hold, "sufficient to manure a leek therewith." Coarse sand sufficient to fill a trowel, reed sufficient to make a writing-pen, and should it be thick or split, sufficient to boil the lightest of eggs <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">5</font></a>, [which], mixed with oil, [lies] in a hot shell.</p>  
 <p>§ 6. Bone sufficient to make a spoon. R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to make [a fitting] for a key." Glass sufficient to scrape the top of a weaver's shuttle therewith, a lump of mould, or a stone, large enough to throw at a bird. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "large enough to throw at a beast."</p>  
 <p>§ 7. Potsherds large enough to put between deals to poise them. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, "large enough to shovel up ignited fuel therewith." R. José saith, "large enough to receive [hold] quarter [of a lug]." R. Meir saith, "Although there is not [any absolute] proof in support [of my] assertion, there is an indication [of my] assertion; for it is said, 'There shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth.'" <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">6</font></a> But R. José replied, "[Can you] thence [adduce] a proof? [Does not the sentence conclude with the words], 'or to take water withal out of the pit?'" <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>
