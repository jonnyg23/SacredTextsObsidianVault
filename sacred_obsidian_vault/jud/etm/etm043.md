 <p>§ 1. A man may lift up his child with a stone in its hand; also, a hamper, wherein there is a stone; and unclean heave-offering may be moved with clean and with non-consecrated things. R. Jehudah saith, "They may also take out the heave-offering from ‏מדמע‎, <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the proportion of one to the hundred. <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 2. [If] a stone [lie] on the bung-hole of a cask, a man may incline the cask to one side, so that the stone fall of. If it [the cask in question] is among other casks, he may raise it, and incline it on one side, so that the stone may fall off. If there be money [coins] on a bolster, the bolster may be turned, so that they may fall off. If there be any ordure on a pillow, man may wipe it off with a rag; if the cover [of the pillow] be of skin, water may be poured on it until the ordure is rinsed off.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Beth Shammai hold, "That men may carry from the table bones and husks." Beth Hillel hold, "That the whole table-cloth is to be lifted up and shaken." <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">3</font></a> They may carry away from the table</p>

 <p>fragments [of food] less than the size of an olive, and also the husks of beans and of lentiles; for these are food for cattle. A sponge, if it has a leather handle, they may wipe with it; if not, they must not wipe with it. The sages hold, "That, of either kind, it [the sponge] may be moved on the Sabbath, and is not liable to contract uncleanness."</p>

The remnants here spoken of are only such as may serve to feed cattle. </p>
