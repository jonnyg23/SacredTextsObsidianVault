 <p>§ 1. Wherewith may [a man let] an animal go out? <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1a</font></a> and wherewith may [he] not [let] it go out? The camel [he] may [let] go out with its halter, the she camel with a nose-ring; the Lybian ass with bridle and bit; the horse with its collar; all [animals] that wear a collar may go out therewith, and be led thereby; [in case it, the collar, becomes unclean] it must be rinsed, and dipped in its place [without taking it off.]</p>  
 <p>§ 2. The ass goes out with its rug [while it is tied on him]. He-goats may go out with a leather bandage round their privates; sheep with their tails fastened up or down, and with wrapper; <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">2</font></a> sire-goats</p>

 <p>with their udders tied up. R. Jose prohibits all these, excepting the sheep with wrapper. R. Jehudah saith, "She-goats may go out with their udders tied up, if [this be done] to dry [up the milk], but not if it be done to [preserve the] milk."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Wherewith may [a man] not [let] animals go out? The camel must not go out with a rag tied to its tail, <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">3</font></a> nor with its legs strapped, <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor with its fore and hind-legs fastened together; <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">5</font></a> this [applies] to all domestic animals. A man must not fasten camels together and lead them, but he may hold the [different] ropes in his hand, only [taking care] that they do not get twisted. <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 4. An ass must not go out with its rug that had not been fastened on [before the Sabbath], nor with a bell, although it be muffled, nor with a wooden frame-work round its neck, <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">7</font></a> nor with a strap to its legs. Hens must not go out with cords <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">8</font></a> tied on them, nor with straps to their feet. Rams must not go out with go-carts to their tails; <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">9</font></a> nor sheep with sneezing-wood; <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">10</font></a> nor calves with a reed-yoke; <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">11</font></a> nor a cow with the skin of a hedgehog tied to her udders, <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">12</font></a> nor with a strap between her horns. The cow of R. Eleazar hen Azariah went out [on the Sabbath] with a strap between her horns, which was against the consent of the sages.</p>
