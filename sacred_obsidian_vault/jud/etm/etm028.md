 <p>§ 1. Wherewith [on her person] may a woman go out? and wherewith may she not go out? <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a> A woman must not go out with linen or woollen laces; nor with the straps on her head, because</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>she cannot bathe with them on, but must first unfasten them: nor with a frontlet and pendants thereto, <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">2</font></a> unless sewn to her cap; nor with the lining of the frontlet, into the public reshuth; <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">3</font></a> nor with a golden [ornament in the shape of a] town; nor with a tight gold chain; nor with nose-rings; nor with finger-rings, on which there is no seal; nor with a needle without an eye: but if she has gone out with either of these, she is not guilty [to bring] a sin-offering.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. A man is not to go out with iron-bound sandals, <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor with one [iron-bound shoe], unless he has a sore in [the other] foot; nor yet with Tephilin; <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">5</font></a> nor yet with an amulet, unless it be by a distinguished sage; nor with cuirass, helmet, or armour for the legs: but if he has gone out [with either of these] he is not guilty [to bring] a sin-offering.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. A woman must not go out with a needle that has an eye; nor with a finger-ring that has a seal on it; nor with a ‏כוליאר‎; <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">6</font></a> nor with a smelling-bottle, or balm-flask: if she has gone out [with either of these] on her person, she is guilty, [and bound to bring] a sin-offering. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages absolve her [therefrom, as far as regards going out] with a smelling-bottle or balm-flask.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. Man must not go out with a sword, nor with a bow, nor with a triangular shield, nor with a round one, nor with a spear; if he has gone out [with either of these] he is guilty, [and bound to bring] a sin-offering. R. Eleazar saith, "They are ornaments [becoming] to him:" but the sages hold, "they are nothing else but a stigma [unbecoming], for it is said, 'They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears unto pruning-books, nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.'" <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Knee-buckles are clean, and a man may go out with them on the Sabbath; stride-chains <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">8</font></a> are liable to become unclean, and a man must not go out with them on the Sabbath.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. A woman may go out with plaits of hair, whether of her own hair or of another woman, or of an animal; with frontlet and pendants, if they are sewn fast to the cap; with the lining of a frontlet, and with false-ringlets [curls], into the courtyard; with soft wool in her ears, or soft wool in her shoe, or soft wool she has prepared for her menstruation; with a [grain of] pepper or [of] salt, or with whatever else she [is accustomed to] put into her mouth, provided she does not put it [into her mouth] especially on the Sabbath; and if she drop it [out of her mouth on the ground] she must not put it back [into her mouth] again; a false tooth, or a gilt tooth, Rabbi permits [the going out with]; but the sages prohibit [it].</p>  
 <p>§ 6. Women may go out with a coin fastened on a swelling in their feet; little girls may go out with laces on, and even with wires in their ears; Arabian women may go out in their large veils, and Median women in their mantillas: so [indeed] may any one; but the sages adduce their instances from existing [and known objects].</p>  
 <p>§ 7. A woman may fold up a stone, or a nut, or a coin, in her mantilla, provided she does it not especially on the Sabbath-day.</p>  
 <p>§ 8. The cripple may go out with his wooden leg: such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. José prohibits it. If the wooden leg has a hollow receptacle for rags, it is [liable to become] unclean; leather crutches [of a cripple who is lame of both ankles], are [liable to become] unclean from pressure; but he may go out with them on the Sabbath, and [also] enter into the outer court [of the temple] with them. The chair and crutches [of one who is paralytic] are [liable to become] unclean from pressure, he must not go out with them on the Sabbath, and he must not enter the outer court [of the Temple] with them: ‏אנקטמין‎ <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">9</font></a> are clean, but he must not go out with them.</p>  
 <p>§ 9. Boys may go out with their bands, and princes with golden bells: so [indeed] may every one, but the sages adduce their instances from things existing [and known].</p>  
 <p>§ 10. It is permitted to go out with the egg of a grasshopper, or</p>

 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>the tooth of a fox, or the nail of one who has been hanged, as medical remedies: such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages hold [according to another version; such is the dictum of R. José, but R. Meir holds], "That even on the week-day this is prohibited, because of [its imitating] the ways of the Amorites." <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>
