 <p>§ 1. On the evening of [previous to] the 14th of Nissan, it is necessary to make search for leaven by the light of a candle; it is not required to search places in which it is not usual to put leaven. Why then was it ordered that two rows [of barrels] must be searched? Because it treats there of a warehouse or wine-cellar, in which leaven is sometimes carried. Beth Shammai decide, "that search must be made between two rows of barrels over the whole surface of such a warehouse;" but Beth Hillel say, "It is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>sufficient to search between the two external rows, which are also the highest." <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 2. It needs not be suspected that a weasel might [possibly] have dragged any leaven from one house or place to another; <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">2</font></a> for if so, the same suspicion will attach to a [possible] removal from one court, or even from one city to another, and [the search] would thus become an endless task.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. R. Jehudah says, "It is necessary to search on the evening before the 14th [of Nissan], or early on the morning of that day, or at the time [when all leaven must be removed];" but the sages say, "If no search has been made on the evening preceding the 14th, it must be done on that day: if omitted on that day, it must be done at the time appointed <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">3</font></a> [for the removal of leaven], and in case it was then also omitted, it must be done afterwards, <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">4</font></a> and whatever leaven remains, must be kept in a well guarded place, that no further search may become necessary."</p>  
 <p>§ 4. R. Meir says, "It is lawful to eat [leaven on the 14th] the whole of the first five hours, <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">5</font></a> and what remains must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour:" but R. Jehudah says, "It is only permitted to eat [leaven] the first four hours; it must be abstained from during the whole of the fifth hour; and it must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour."</p>  
 <p>§ 5. R. Jehudah also taught, "That formerly, two cakes of thanksgiving-offering which had become desecrated, were exposed on a bench or gallery [of the Temple]. Whilst they lay there, all the people did yet eat [leaven]: when one was removed, they abstained</p>

 <p>from eating, but did not burn it; when both were removed, all the people commenced burning [the leaven]." Rabbon Gamaliel says, "Non-consecrated things may be eaten during the first four hours; but heave-offering may yet be eaten during the fifth hour: both, however, must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour."</p>  
 <p>§ 6. R. Hanina, the Sagan [chief or principal] of the priests, says, "The priests did never object to burn flesh which had become unclean in an inferior degree, <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">6</font></a> with other flesh which had become unclean in the first degree, <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">7</font></a> although the [legal] impurity of the first mentioned was thereby increased." R. Akivah added to this, and said, "The priests did never object to burn the oil of heave-offering, which had become unclean by being put by an unclean person, who [however] had bathed on that day, into [a metal] lamp which had come in contact with a dead body, although a higher degree of impurity had thus been added to its former impurity."</p>  
 <p>§ 7. R. Meir says, "We learn from their words, that it is lawful, on account of the Passover, to burn clean heave-offering [of leaven] with that which has become unclean;" but R. Jose said to him, "This is not a [true] inference;" R. Eleazar and R. Joshua agree, however, that it is necessary to burn each separately. Wherein do they differ? Concerning things whose uncleanliness is doubtful, and things which are certainly unclean; for R. Eleazar says, "Each of these must be burned separately;" but R. Joshua says, "They may be burned together."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_248">98:1</a> This is variously explained; the plainest exposition seems to be the following:—supposing 100 barrels to be piled up one on the other, in a cellar or warehouse, in ten rows of ten barrels each; according to Beth Shammai, the front and top rows must be searched; but Beth Hillel consider it sufficient to search between the two external rows (i.e. those in a perpendicular position), in the first only.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_249">98:2</a> From a place that has not been searched to one that has.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_250">98:3</a> The word ‏מועד‎ is here rendered according to Rashi; others have explained it in its usual sense, namely, "festival."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_251">98:4</a> After the search has been made to serve for the consumption of the family, between that time and the period when all leaven must be burned, or otherwise removed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_252">98:5</a> That is, Till eleven o'clock. To reduce the rabbinical hours to our modern computation of time, add six to the hours mentioned in the Mishna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="etm059.htm#fr_253">99:6</a> That is, the second degree of impurity.</p>
