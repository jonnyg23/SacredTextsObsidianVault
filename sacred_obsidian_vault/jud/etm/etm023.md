 <p>§ 1. The prohibition to carry or convey [from one reshuth <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> into another] on the Sabbath, is twofold; which [according to the decision of the sages], form four [prohibitions for him who is] inside [of the reshuth]; and also twofold which [according to the decision of the sages], form four [prohibitions for him who is] outside [of the reshuth]. How is this to be understood? A mendicant stands outside [of the private property], and the master of the house inside [of it]: <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a> should the mendicant put his hand in [to the private reshuth], and [either] put [his wallet] into the master's hand, or take something out of it [the master's hand into his own], and draw his hand back, [into the public reshuth, in which he is standing], the mendicant is guilty, but the master of the house is absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand [into the public reshuth in which the mendicant is standing,] and put [his gift] into the hand of the mendicant, or take [the wallet] out of it, and draw his hand back [into the house or private reshuth in which he is], the master of the house is guilty, but the mendicant is absolved. Should the mendicant put his hand in, and the master take [the wallet] out of it, or put [his gift] into it, and the mendicant [then] draw his hand out, both are absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand, and the mendicant take [the gift] out of it, or put [his wallet] into it, both are absolved. <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 2. A man is not to sit down to the barber, near the time of ‏מנחה‎ until he has said his prayers; <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor must man [about that</p>

 <p>time on the Sabbath-eve] visit the bath, or the tan-yard; he must not sit down to his meal, nor yet in judgment; but if he have begun [to do either] he needs not leave off. [The study of the Law] is to be interrupted for the Shemang, but not for the Tephilah. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 3. The tailor must not go out with his needle near dusk [on the Sabbath-eve], lest he forget and carry it out with him [during the Sabbath]. The scribe [writer] is not to go out with his writing-reed [pen]; nor must a man cleanse his garments of vermin, or read by candle-light [on the Sabbath-eve]. They [the sages] have indeed permitted [that] a teacher may superintend children, who are reading [by candle-light], but he [himself] must not read. From the same motive [to avoid the possible occasion to sin] a man afflicted with a running issue, must not take his meals with a woman afflicted with the same disease. <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 4. The following are among the decisions enacted in the Upper Hall of Hananiah, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Giorion, when they [the sages] went thither, and went up to visit him. On that occasion the sages present were counted, and [the sages of] the school of Shammai were found to be more numerous than [those of] the school of Hillel. On that day eighteen enactments were decreed.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to soak the materials for making ink, or drugs for dying, or vetch [to feed cattle] [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient to soak it through, during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
 <p>§ 6. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to put bundles of flax into the oven [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient to steam [dry] them during the day; nor to put wool into the dye-kettle, unless there be time sufficient for the wool to imbibe the dye during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: all of which Beth Hillel permit. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to spread [set] nets for game, fowl, or fish [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient for it to be caught therein during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
 <p>§ 7. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to sell any thing to a heathen [on the Sabbath-eve], or to help him to load, or to load for him, unless there be time sufficient for him to reach a neighbouring</p>

 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>town [or village] during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
 <p>§ 8. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to deliver skins to a heathen tanner, or clothes to a heathen laundress [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there he time enough for them to be got ready during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: all of this Beth Hillel permit to be done, while the sun remains above the horizon.</p>  
 <p>§ 9. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "It was the custom in my father's house, to deliver white garments to the heathen laundress three days before Sabbath." [Both schools] agree, that it is permitted to put blocks on the oil-press, and the round logs on the wine-press near the coming in of the Sabbath]. <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 10. Neither meat, onions, nor eggs, must be fried [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient for them to get quite done during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]. Bread must not be put into the oven towards dusk [nightfall] on the Sabbath-eve, nor cakes on the coals, unless there be time enough for the surface to become crusted during the day [before the Sabbath comes in], R. Eleazar saith [unless there be time sufficient for] the bottom to become crusted.</p>  
 <p>§ 11. It is permitted to put the paschal offering into the oven towards dusk on the Sabbath-eve <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">8</font></a> And the priests [in the Temple] may stir the fire a little in the hearth-room, <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">9</font></a> but in other halls [of the Temple] only if there is time sufficient for the fire to seize on the greater part of the wood. R. Jehudah saith of coals, "if any part of them be ignited [before the Sabbath come in]."</p>
