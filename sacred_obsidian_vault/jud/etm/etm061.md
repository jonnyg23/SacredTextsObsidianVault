 <p>§ 1. The law concerning tire due observance of the Passover, will be transgressed by using the following articles: namely, Babylonian ‏כותח‎, <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a> Median beer [made of wheat or barley], Edomite vinegar, <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a> Egyptian zeithum, <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">3</font></a> the dough of bran used by dyers, the dough used</p>

 <p>by cooks, <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">4</font></a> and the paste used by writers; <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">5</font></a> R. Eleazar says, also the paste used by women to adorn themselves with. <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">6</font></a> This is the general rule: whatever is composed of any kind of grain, can cause a transgression of the paschal laws; and they that are guilty of this, incur the penalty attached to the transgression of an admonitory precept, <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">7</font></a> but not that of being "utterly cut off" [‏כרת‎].</p>  
 <p>§ 2. If there be any dough in the holes or crevices of a kneading-trough: <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">8</font></a> if there is as much as the size of an olive in any one place, it must be forthwith removed, but if less than that quantity is together in one place, it may be considered as non-existing, being so inconsiderable; and thus it is in respect to pollutions. <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">9</font></a> But when the dough is cared for [when the owner wishes to use it], it forms a separation, <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">10</font></a> [and the trough is unpolluted], but when it is desired to leave the dough in the trough, it must be considered as forming an integral part of the trough; <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">11</font></a> a dull dough <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">12</font></a> may not be used, if one of the same quality and size can become leavened in the same time.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. How can the cake of the dough [‏חלה‎] be separated on the Passover when it has become unclean? <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">13</font></a> R. Eleazar says, "It is only to be named after it has been baked;" R. Jehudah, son of Beterah says, "This is not the leaven concerning which it is said, 'It shall not be seen nor found in thy house;'" it must, therefore, be separated, and left till the evening, without caring whether it becomes leaven or not.</p>

 <p>§ 4. Rabbon Gamaliel says, "Three women may knead dough on the Passover at one time, and bake it in the same oven, one after the other;" but the sages say, "Three women may occupy themselves with their dough, but in the following manner: one shall knead and another fashion the dough, whilst the third bakes;" R. Akivah says, "It is not the same with all women, wood, or ovens." <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">14</font></a> This is the rule: as soon as dough becomes inflated, let the woman plunge her hand in cold water. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 5. Dough which begins to become leavened must be burned; but the person who eats it has not incurred the penalty [of excision]. Dough which falls in holes or rents must be burned, and whoever eats it has incurred the penalty of excision. When is a dough to be considered as commencing to become leavened? When it exhibits small rents standing apart in different directions, like the antennae [horns or feelers] of locusts. A dough which falls in holes or rents is thus to be considered, when the rents cross each other: such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages say, "Whoever eats either incurs the penalty of excision." When is a dough to be considered as commencing to become leavened? When its surface has become pale, like [the face of] a person whose hair stands on end [through terror].</p>  
 <p>§ 6. When the 14th of Nissan happens on the Sabbath, all [leaven] must be removed <i>before</i> the Sabbath commences: such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages say it is to be done at the proper time; R. Eleazar ben Zadok says, "The heave-offering must be removed before the Sabbath, and non-consecrated things at the proper time.</p>  
 <p>§ 7. If a person went [on the 14th of Nissan] to slaughter his Passover-sacrifice, or to circumcise his son, or to eat the betrothing-meal at the house of his father-in-law, and remembers on the road that he has left leaven in his house: if he can return home and remove it, and then go back to execute any of the mentioned duties, he must do so, and remove it; but if not, he must mentally declare it as annulled. If his intention, on leaving home, was to aid persons to escape from armed foes, from inundation, robbers, or fire, or to save persons from under the ruins of fallen buildings, he may mentally annul the leaven; but if his intention was to obtain a sabbatical resting</p>

 <p>station for his private purposes, <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">16</font></a> he must immediately return to annul the leaven.</p>  
 <p>§ 8. Also, if a person on leaving Jerusalem, remembers having with him consecrated flesh: if he has gone beyond [the hill] Zophim, he may burn it where he is; but if not, he must return, and burn it before the sanctuary, with wood of the altar. What quantity [of flesh or leaven] makes it obligatory to return? R. Meir says, "When both are the size of an egg;" R. Jehudah says, "When of the size of an olive;" but the sages say, "Consecrated flesh when of the size of an olive, and leaven when of the size of an egg."</p>
