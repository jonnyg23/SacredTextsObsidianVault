 <p>§ 1. Dry land may be irrigated on the Moed, <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">1</font></a> and also during the Sabbatical year, as well from a fountain that is newly sprung forth, as from one that is not newly sprung forth; but they must not irrigate it with rain-water, nor with water [drawn] from a deep well; nor may they make [dig] trenches [to hold water] round vines.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, "They must not make [dig] a fresh trench [conduit, or water course] on the Moed, or during the Sabbatical year." But the sages hold, that a fresh trench [water course] may be dug during the Sabbatical year, and that those [conduits] which are choked up, may be repaired on the Moed. They may [likewise] repair water reservoirs [which are] in the public reshuth, <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">2</font></a> and cleanse them: They may also repair the roads [streets], the market [public] places, and the spring-baths. In short, they may do whatever the exigencies of the public [service] require. They</p>

 <p>may mark [whitewash] tombs, <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">3</font></a> and even send out [inspectors] of Kilaim. <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 3. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "They may lead water from tree to tree, provided always the whole orchard be not irrigated; plants which have not imbibed <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">5</font></a> [water] before the Moed, must not be irrigated during the Moed." <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">6</font></a> But the sages permit the one and the other.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. They may [by means of gins and pit-falls] catch moles and field-mice in orchards and fields, but they must not [do this] in the [usual] way, <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">7</font></a> both on the Moed and during the Sabbatical year. But the sages hold that in an orchard [the vermin may he caught] in the [usual] way, but that in a corn-field [it must] not [be caught] in the [usual] way. During the Moed they may pile [loose stones to stop] a gap <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">8</font></a> [in a fence], but during the Sabbatical year they repair it in the [ordinary] way.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. R. Meir saith, "Priests make the first inspection of the plague [of leprosy] in order to relieve [the patient], but not to restrict [him]." But the sages decide neither to relieve nor to restrict [in no case is such an inspection to be undertaken during the Moed]. <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">9</font></a> R. Meir [further] saith, "A man may collect the bones of his father and mother [during the Moed, to inter them], because it is a satisfaction to him [relieves his mind]." But R. José saith, "It is a grief to him [afflicts his mind]. Man is not to excite [others to mourn] over his dead, <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">10</font></a> nor hold a funeral oration for thirty days before the festival."</p>

 <p>§ 6. They must not dig graves or burial vaults on the Moed, but they may prepare [enlarge] graves [previously dug] on the Moed, and also make a washing pit during the Moed, and a coffin in the same court where the corpse lies. [This, however,] R. Jehudah prohibits, unless the boards have been [previously] provided.</p>  
 <p>§ 7. They must not espouse wives on the Moed, neither virgins nor widows; nor must they be ‏מיבם‎, <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">11</font></a> as that [the espousal] is a cause of joy to him individually, <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">12</font></a> but he may receive back his own divorced wife. A woman may prepare her ornaments on the Moed. R. Jehudah saith, "She must not apply lime [chalk as a cosmetic], because it [may] disfigure her."</p>  
 <p>§ 8. An ordinary person [who is not of the craft] may sew [make stitches] in the [regular] way; but the craftsman [whose trade it is to sew, must only do it] zigzag [during the Moed]. They may twine [the ropes in the sacking of] bedsteads. R. José saith, "[They may] only tighten [the ropes]."</p>  
 <p>§ 9. They may erect an oven, or a hearth, or a mill, on the Moed [for the use of the festival]. R. Jehudah saith, "New millstones must not be chipped." <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 10. A railing [balustrade] may be made round a roof, or gallery [according to the] workmanship of common men, but not [according to the] workmanship of [regular] craftsmen. Rents [in the roof] may also be closed, and [then] smoothened with a roller, <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">14</font></a> or with hand and foot, but not with a trowel. Should the hinges of the door-frame, or the beam, or the lock [of the door], or the key [thereto], have been broken, they may be repaired on the Moed, provided always he does not intentionally put off the repairs till the Moed. All [kinds of] pickled food <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">15</font></a> of which he can eat during the Moed, may be pickled.</p>
