 <p><i>Every bird dwelleth according to his kind,<br>
 and (so doth) man according to his like.</i><br>
    -- Ben Sira's Proverbs, XXIV, <a href="ohpe04.htm#page_xxii">p. xxii</a>.</p>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This is a scholarly monograph from the late 19th century on one of the
 Jewish non-canonical Biblical books, <a href="../../bib/apo/sir.htm">Sirach</a>, also known as 'Ecclesiasticus,' not to be confused with the canonical
 book <cite>Ecclesiastes</cite>.
 This particular paper has been cited because it has a section on the
 'Alphabet of Ben Sira,' a set of Talmudic Jewish proverbs, each of
 which begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
 The Hebrew text and English translation of each of these proverbs
 is included <a href="ohpe05.htm">here</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 What the general interest reader will find at the core of
 this otherwise very dry dissertation is an exquisite example of Rabbinical era
 Jewish wisdom literature.
 What won't be found here is the <i>Midrash</i> of the Alphabet of Ben Sira,
 which is in some demand because of a passage about the
 early Hebrew goddess-figure Lilith.
 The Midrash of Ben Sira is commentary built on the Alphabet of Ben Sira,
 and it reputedly includes a number of notoriously transgressive stories.
 This Midrash has apparently not yet been fully translated into English, and
 when it is, that translation won't be public domain.

 <p>
 Production notes: there is much in this document which would be
 very difficult to convert to text format, due to the limitations of
 current OCR technology.
 I have omitted several portions, particularly:
 the Hebrew and Greek text in the proverbs section, a Latin text of
 Sirach, a vocabulary, and the Hebrew, Greek and Syriac text from the
 Sirach section.
 However, as previously noted, I did transcribe the complete
 Hebrew text of the Alphabet of Ben Sira.
