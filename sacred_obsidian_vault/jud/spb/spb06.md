 <p align="center"><i>The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner</i>.</p>  
 <p>And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.</p>

 <p><i>Cong. and Mourner</i>.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>
