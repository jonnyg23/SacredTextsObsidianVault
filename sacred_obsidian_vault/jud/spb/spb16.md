 <p align="center"><i>The following is said in the Home by the Master of the House, previous to partaking of the Sabbath Meal:—</i></p>  
 <p><small>And it was evening and it was morning—the sixth day.</small></p>  
 <p>And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host. And on the seventh day God had finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and he hallowed it, because he rested thereon from all his work which God had created and made.</p>  
 <p><small>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the fruit of the vine.</small></p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast taken pleasure in us, and in love and favor hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance, a memorial of the creation—that day being also the first of the holy convocations, in remembrance of the departure from Egypt. For thou hast chosen us and sanctified us above all nations, and in love and favor hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.</p>  
 <p><small>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth.</small></p>
