 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Standard Prayer Book</span> is an American reprint of <i>The Authorized Daily Prayer Book</i>, which is in general use today throughout the British Empire. It was originally published under the authorization of the late Chief Rabbi, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler. The English translation, by the Rev. Simeon Singer, is universally acknowledged to be the best ever published. This American edition is set from new and larger type and is characterized by the continuity of the text, which has necessitated the addition of nearly 300 pages, making it the most complete daily prayer-book ever published.</p>
