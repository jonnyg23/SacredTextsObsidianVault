And so spitting (is forbidden) by the same argument. For as with a shoe, in connexion with which there is no customary contempt, the Law says: <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="tbr63.htm#fn_528"><font size="1">8</font></a> Do not enter in—with a shoe, how much less with spitting in which there is customary contempt.</dir>
