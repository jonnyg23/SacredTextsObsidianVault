Perchance [any] moisture which is on the napkin becomes unclean through the cushion [if the napkin were placed there], and makes his hands unclean again.  
 <p>The School of Hillel say: Any doubt about moisture on his hands means that he is clean.</p>  
 <p>Another reason [is given]: The washing of the hands is not for ordinary food. <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">1</font></a> But one wipes his hand with a napkin, and leaves it on the cushion. Perchance [any] moisture which is on the napkin will become unclean through the table, and make the eatables unclean again.</p>  
 <p>5. The School of Shammai say: The cup of wine <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">2</font></a> is on one's right hand, and sweet-smelling oil on one's left. He says the Benediction over the wine and afterwards says the Benediction over the oil. <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">3</font></a> But the School of Hillel say: Sweet-smelling oil on his right, and cup of wine on his left. He says the Benediction over the oil and smears it on the head of the attendant. <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">4</font></a> If the attendant be learned in the Law, he smears it on the wall, for it is no credit to one learned in the Law to go out anointed with perfume.</p></dir>
