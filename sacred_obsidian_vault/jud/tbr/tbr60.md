Ben Azzai says, Four; two on his entrance and two on his exit. What does he say on his entrance? "May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD our God, that Thou wilt cause me to enter this town in peace." If he has entered in peace he says: "I acknowledge <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">2</font></a> before Thee that Thou hast caused me to enter in peace. May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou wilt bring me out of this town in peace." If he has gone out in peace he says: "I acknowledge before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou hast brought me out of this town in peace, and even as Thou hast brought me out in peace so mayest Thou cause me to walk in peace and mayest uphold me in peace until I reach my home in peace."  
 <p>17. He that entereth into a [public] bath <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">3</font></a> prays two prayers, one when he enters and one when he goes out. When he enters he says: "May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou wilt cause me to enter in peace, and wilt bring me out in peace And let no mischief happen to me, <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">4</font></a> and if any mischief happen to me let my death be</p></dir>

 <p>18. R.

 <p>They say in parables, To what is the matter like? To a king of flesh and blood who told his servant to boil him some broth, though he had never boiled him broth in his life. The result was he burnt the broth and provoked his master. [He told him] to make him a fold to his shirt, though he had never made him a fold to a shirt in his life.</p></dir>

 <p><a name="fn_503"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_504">82:5</a> <i>Ben Azzai</i>. Simeon ben Azzai (a shortened form of Azariah) was one of the famous four, Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Elisha ben Abujah, and Agiba (<i>c</i>. 110-135).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_504"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_505">83:1</a> <i>for what is past . . . for what is about to come</i>. <i>i.e.</i> the substance of his two prayers both on entering and on leaving. They are thus four in all.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_506">83:2</a> <i>I acknowledge</i> (<i>môdeh ani</i>). <i>i.e.</i> in open thankfulness and praise. Cf. ἐξομολογεῖσθαι Matt. 11<sup>25</sup>; Luke 10<sup>21</sup>; Rom. 14<sup>11</sup>, 15<sup>9</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_506"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_507">83:3</a> <i>a</i> [<i>public</i>] <i>bath</i>. It was dangerous more especially because of its elaborate heating apparatus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_507"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_508">83:4</a> <i>happen to me</i> (<i>ye’ra‘ bî</i>). Jastrow (p. 1382<sup>b</sup>) translates the parallel passage in the Gemara, <i>T</i>. B. 60<sup>a</sup>, "that no mischief or sin may occur through me," but the immediate reference to death seems to preclude this.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_508"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_509">84:1</a> <i>let my death be an atonement</i>, cf. <i>supra</i>, <a href="tbr14.htm#page_13">p. 13</a>. Cf. <i>Yoma</i> VIII. 8: "Death and the Day of Atonement make atonement, with repentance."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_509"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_510">84:2</a> <i>all like it, in the future that is to come</i>. <i>i.e.</i> the fire of Gehenna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_510"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_511">84:3</a> <i>even so . . . before Thee</i>. Cf. Matt. 11<sup>26</sup>; Luke 10<sup>21</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_511"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_512">84:4</a> <i>an uneducated man</i> (<i>bôr</i>). The first two of these Benedictions are in SA, pp. 5 <i>sq</i>., but for the third is given, "Who hast not made me a bondman."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_513"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_514">84:6</a> <i>the commandments</i>. <i>i.e.</i> the many religious duties, not the fundamental duties towards God and man.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_514"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_515">84:7</a> <i>no uneducated person fears sin</i>. How can he, in Rabbinic opinion, for he has no accurate knowledge of what constitutes sin?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_515"></a><a href="tbr60.htm#fr_516">85:1</a> <i>provoked his master</i>. The point of the parable is, that less is expected from a Gentile, a woman, and an uneducated person. They are all ignorant of the specific religious duties.</p>
