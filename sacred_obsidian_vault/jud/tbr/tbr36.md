 <p>5. He who is praying and makes a mistake—it is a bad omen for him.

 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="tbr35.htm#fr_263">41:1</a> B prefixes: "He that says, Let the good say the Benediction, lo, this smacks of heresy (<i>minûth</i>)," as suggesting the division of members into worthy and unworthy. But it would not appear to have any connexion with Christianity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="tbr35.htm#fr_264">41:2</a> <i>after the priests</i>. The blessing from Num. 6<sup>24-26</sup> was given by the priests between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Benedictions (SA, p. 53). If the leader said "Amen" he was in danger of forgetting the last Benediction. The priests face the people, and the leader faces the priests and says the blessings word for word for them to repeat. To each of the three blessings the people say Amen. See Maimonides.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="tbr35.htm#fr_265">41:3</a> <i>his hands</i>. Literally "his palms," perhaps the palms of the hands were held up towards the congregation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="tbr36.htm#fr_266">41:4</a> <i>the representative of the congregation</i> (<i>shliach tsibbur</i>). In his duties for the occasion; it was not a permanent office (Elbogen, p. 488).</p>
