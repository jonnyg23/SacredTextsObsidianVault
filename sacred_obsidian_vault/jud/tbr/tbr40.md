When the cup is mixed for them, although he has said the Benediction over the first he says one [again] over the second. When the <i>hors d’œuvres</i> have been brought, although he has said the Benediction over the first he says one [again] over the second, and one person says it for them all. He that comes after three <i>hors d’œuvres</i> is not allowed to enter.  
 <p>9. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: This was a great custom in Jerusalem; a towel was spread on the top of the doorway; all the time that the towel was spread guests could enter; when the towel was removed guests were not allowed to enter.</p>  
 <p>10. And further there was another custom in Jerusalem. They used to entrust the meal to a cook. If anything in the meal was faulty they used to fine the cook. Everything had to be for the honour of the host, and everything for the honour of the guests.</p>  
 <p>11. The rule in a feast is that if one goes out to relieve nature, he washes one hand; if to speak with his companion and he breaks off [from the meal], he washes both hands, <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">1</font></a> Where does he go to wash? He comes and reclines in his place, and washes, and dries his hands, <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">2</font></a> and returns the napkin to the guests.</p>  
 <p>12. Ben Zoma was asked: Why when wine comes in the middle of food does each one say the Benediction for himself? He said to them: because the gullet is not empty. <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>V. 5. What is the order of reclining? When there are two couches, the eldest <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">3</font></a> reclines at the head of the first, and the second to him, below him; <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">4</font></a> and when there are three couches the eldest reclines at the head of the middle one, the second to him above him, the third to him below him. So they go on arranging them.</p>  
 <p>6. The order of washing hands—how is it [arranged]? Up to the number of five [persons] they begin with the eldest; from five and onwards they begin with the youngest.</p>  
 <p>The order of mixing the cup—how is it [arranged]? In the middle of the meal they begin with the eldest; and after the meal they begin with him who says the Benediction. If [the latter] wishes to assign the honour to his teacher, or to one who is older than himself, he is permitted to do so.</p>  
 <p>7. Two wait each for the other at a dish; <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">5</font></a> but three do not wait. <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">6</font></a> He who says the Benediction stretches his hand out first [to take the food]. If he wishes to assign the honour to his teacher, or to one who is older than himself, he is <a href="errata.htm#2">permitted</a> to do so.</p></dir>

 <p>9. A man may not drink of a cup and give it to his companion, because men's taste differs. <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">1</font></a></p></dir>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>VI. 7. If salted relish <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">2</font></a> is brought before him at first, and a piece of bread with it, he says the Benediction over the salted relish, and lets the piece of bread go free, for the piece of bread is an accompaniment to it. This is the general rule: In the case of everything which is the principal food, with other food accompanying it, one says the Benediction over the principal food, and lets the accompaniment go free.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. IV. 14. In the case of salted fish, and a piece of bread—one says a Benediction over the salted fish and lets the piece go free. R. Chananiah ben Gamaliel says: In the case of a bit of bread that comes first, before the meal, and a bit of bread that comes with the salted fish after the meal, a Benediction is required before it and after it.  
 <p>Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: Pieces of bread are a great sign to guests. So long as the guests see the pieces they know that something more is coming after them; <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">3</font></a> when [they see] a whole loaf and beans they know that nothing else comes after them.</p>  
 <p>15. We say <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">4</font></a> the Benediction over that corn which is of the choicest. How so? In the case of a whole loaf of Lesbian flour <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">5</font></a> and a whole loaf of</p></dir>

In the case of a piece of Lesbian and a whole loaf of home-grown? One says the Benediction over the whole loaf of homegrown. If there is wheaten bread and barley bread? One says the Benediction over the wheaten. If there is a piece of wheaten and a whole loaf of barley? One says the Benediction over the piece of wheaten. If barley bread and spelt bread? One says the Benediction over the barley bread. But is not spelt superior to barley? Yes, but barley is one of the seven kinds, and spelt is not. This is the general principle: In the case of everything that is one of the seven kinds or a kind of corn. Rabban Gamaliel says: One says three Benedictions after it; and the Majority say, One Benediction.  
 <p>Now there is an incident in [the life of] Rabban Gamaliel and some Elders, who were reclining at a meal in Jericho. Dried dates <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">1</font></a> were brought before them. R. Aqiba made haste and said one Benediction after it. Rabban Gamaliel said to him: Aqiba, why dost thou put thy head between contending parties? <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">2</font></a> He said to him: Rabbi, thou hast taught us to incline after the greater number; although thou sayest so, yet the Rule is according to the words of those who are more numerous. <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

In the case of anything which is not one of the seven kinds, and is not a kind of corn, Rabban Gamaliel says: One Benediction, and the Majority say: A man does not say any Benediction at all.  
 <p>16. There is an incident in the life of R. Tarphon, who was sitting in the shadow of a dovecot on a sabbath in the afternoon. A bucket of cold water was brought before him. R. Tarphon said to his disciples: In what manner shall he who drinketh water to satisfy his thirst say the Benediction? His disciples said to him: "Teach us, O our Rabbi." He said to them: "Thou that createst souls and that which they need." He said to them: "Shall I discuss this?" They said to him: "Teach us." He said to them: Behold He said: "<i>and they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling company of Ishmaelites</i>," <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">1</font></a> etc. But is it not the custom of Arabs to he carrying nothing but skins of evil odour and resin? But [we read] that they set that righteous man <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">2</font></a> among their precious things. <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">3</font></a> Now behold these words yield the argument of the less to the greater: If this happened at a time when the righteous were under [God's] anger, and mercy was shown them, how much more in the time of His mercy!</p>  
 <p>17. Like that [are the words] "<i>So they drew near, and carried them in their coats</i>," <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">4</font></a> etc. And do not these words yield an argument of the less to the</p></dir>

If at the time of God's wrath against the righteous mercy is shown to them, how much more at the time that He has mercy upon them! Like that expression thou findest it said: <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">1</font></a> "The lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass."  <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">2</font></a> And, behold, the words yield an argument of the less to the greater. If at the time of God's wrath against the righteous mercy is shown to them, how much more at the time that He has mercy upon them! He said to them: Shall I discuss it? They said: Teach us, O our Master. He said to them: Why did Judah deserve the kingdom? They said to him:  <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">3</font></a> Because he made confession  <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">4</font></a> about Tamar.  
 <p>18. There is an incident of four elders who were sitting in the portico of R. Joshua. These were they: Eleazar ben Mattai, Chananiah ben Chakinai, and Simeon ben Azzai, and Simeon the Temanite. <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">5</font></a> They were occupied with what R. Aqiba had taught them: Why did Judah deserve the kingdom? Because he made confession about Tamar. They added further of themselves: "<i>Which wise men tell from their fathers, and have not hid it; unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them</i>." <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">6</font></a> He <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">7</font></a> said to them: What!

"<i>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him</i>." <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">1</font></a> He <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">2</font></a> said to them: It is sufficient unto the deliverance that it should atone for the sale. <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">3</font></a>  
 <p>But why did Judah deserve the kingdom? Because of his humility. For it is said: "<i>Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad</i>," <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">4</font></a> etc. Even Saul deserved the kingdom only because of his humility, for it is said: "<i>Lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us</i>," <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">5</font></a> etc. He accounted his servant like himself. But Samuel did not so, but [said]: "<i>Lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and taketh thought for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</i>" <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">6</font></a> And when he was fleeing from the princedom, what does it say? "<i>Therefore they asked of the LORD further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And He said</i>," <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">7</font></a> etc. He <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">8</font></a> said to them: But was he [Judah] not a surety, and the end of being surety is to become free from suretyship. <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">9</font></a> But why did Judah deserve the kingdom? Because he sanctified the name of God [lit.: the Place] at the Sea, for when the tribes came and stood on [the edge of] the sea, this one said: I am going down first, and this said: I am going down first; the tribe of Judah made haste and went down first, and sanctified the name of God at the sea. And concerning that time does it say: "<i>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. I sink in deep mire</i>," <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">10</font></a> etc., and so it says: "<i>When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the</i> </p></dir>

If [during the meal] they have moved to conduct a bride home, <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">2</font></a> and have left there [at the meal] even one old man, or even a sick man, it is not necessary for them to say a Benediction in irregular order; <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">3</font></a> and, when they return, it is not necessary for them to say it as at the beginning. If they have not left anyone there, even an old man, or a sick man, it is necessary for them to say a Benediction in irregular order, and when they return it is necessary to say it as at the beginning.</p>  
 <p>20. In the case of the master of the house who is reclining and eating, <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">4</font></a> and his partner calls him to speak with him, it is not necessary to say a Benediction in irregular order, and when he returns it is not necessary to say it as at the beginning. If he withdraws [voluntarily and for some time] it is necessary to say a Benediction in irregular order, and when he returns it is necessary to say it as at the beginning.</p>  
 <p>21.

 <p>VI. 8.

But the Majority say: One Benediction [which is] the summary of three. R. Aqiba says: even if he eats vegetable <i>potage</i> as his meal, he says three Benedictions over it. And he who drinks water to satisfy his thirst says [the Benediction], "For all came into existence by His word." <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="tbr41.htm#fn_353"><font size="1">3</font></a> R.
