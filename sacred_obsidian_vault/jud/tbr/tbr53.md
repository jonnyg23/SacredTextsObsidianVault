If it be a lantern with glass, one says the Benediction over it, although it is not extinguished. <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">2</font></a>  
 <p>In the case of a lamp belonging to a Gentile we do not say the Benediction over it. An Israelite who lights [his lamp] from a Gentile's, and a Gentile who lights [his lamp] from an Israelite's—we say the Benediction over it [in each case].</p>  
 <p>At what time does a man begin to say the Benediction? As soon as it becomes dark. If he has not said it as soon as it becomes dark, he says it at any time during the night. If he has not said it during all the night, he may not say it later.</p>

But they were thought of <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">5</font></a> in the six days of creation. R. Judah says: The fire of Gehinnom which was created on the second day of creation is never extinguished. For it is said: "<i>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against Me:</i> [<i>for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched</i>]." <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. In the case of the fire and spices of a bath, <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">7</font></a> one does not say the Benediction over them. If one is standing in a spice—shop all the day one says the Benediction only once. If one enters and goes out repeatedly, one says the Benediction each single time.</p></dir>

 <p><a name="fn_424"></a><a href="tbr53.htm#fr_425">70:4</a> <i>that are for the dead</i>. The lamp is therefore not used for light, but for the honour of the dead, and lends itself to superstition. Similarly the burning of spices over the dead may be only for health's sake, or from superstitious motives.</p>
