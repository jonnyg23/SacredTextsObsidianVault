 <p><a name="fn_364"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_365">59:1</a> <i>to give an invitation</i>. One of those present must invite the other two to join with him in a Benediction at the end of a meal. SA, p. 279, with Abrahams' note; <i>vide supra</i>, <a href="tbr40.htm#page_50">p. 50</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_365"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_366">59:2</a> <i>Dmai</i>. Literally, "suspicion" or "talk." Fruits about which there is a suspicion whether they have been tithed or not. The third treatise of the Mishna deals with this subject, and is so called. For the duty of tithing see Lev. 27<sup>30</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_366"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_367">59:3</a> <i>First Tithes from which their Contribution has been taken</i>. For the Contribution see Num. 15<sup>19-21</sup>, and Driver's note on Deut. 12<sup>6</sup>. It is said to have varied from the sixtieth to the fortieth part of the whole untithed produce. The remainder was tithed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_367"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_368">59:4</a> <i>Second Tithes</i>, Num. 18<sup>26</sup>. The Second Tithe was taken from the remainder after the First Tithe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_368"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_369">59:5</a> <i>consecrated things</i>. As for example, Firstlings, Lev. 27<sup>26</sup> <i>sq</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_370">59:6</a> <i>which have been redeemed</i>. This refers to the two last cases, for only if they were redeemed could they be eaten. Redemption was made by giving the value of the thing plus a fifth of that value, Lev. 27<sup>13, 31</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_371">59:7</a> <i>one gives no such invitation</i>. B omits the negative, and rightly, in view of the next clause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_371"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_372">59:8</a> <i>Tebel</i>. Food from which no Contribution or Tithe has been taken.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_373">60:1</a> <i>the stranger</i>. Neither Jew nor Samaritan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_373"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_374">60:2</a> <i>he eats with them</i>. He makes a third person, enabling the formal invitation to be given. It is understood that he is a Jew.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_374"></a><a href="tbr42.htm#fr_375">60:3</a> <i>until they give him permission</i>. For his presence is not necessary.</p>
