Meir; but the majority hold that one suffices. The <i>Semika</i> <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a> is to be decided by three, and the "Laying on of the elders’ hands" by three; but R. Jehuda holds that it is by five.  
 <p>2. Movable vowed property, "Fourth year plants" and "Second tithe" of unknown value are to be redeemed according to the verdict of three experienced dealers in the particular commodity, and not according to that of three who are not experienced.</p>  
 <p>An animal with an obvious blemish <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">2</font></a> is to be slaughtered according to the verdict of any three members of the synagogue,--so R. Meir; but R. Jose <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">3</font></a> says: "Even though it be deformed in the leg and blind in the eye it can be slaughtered only according to the verdict of an expert." The majority hold that one who commits libel when the charge involves a non-capital case is to be judged by three; but if a capital case, by twenty-three.</p>  
 <p>As three judges are required for legal judgment, so three are necessary for arbitration. But when a case has been decided by legal judgment, arbitration is not permitted. R. Eliezer, <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">4</font></a> the son of R. Jose the Galilaean, says: Every one who arbitrates (after judgment has been passed) is a sinner and he who praises such an arbitrator blasphemes The Place. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">5</font></a></p></dir>

Eleazar, <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">4</font></a> the son of Jacob, says: What does Scripture mean by "<i>BOṢEA BEREK</i> <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">5</font></a> BLASPHEMES THE LORD"? They told a parable: To what can this be compared? It is like to a man who had stolen a <i>seâ</i> <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">6</font></a> of wheat; he ground it and baked it and set apart the <i>Ḥalla</i> <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">7</font></a> and fed his children. When such a one recites the Blessing, he does not bless, but he blasphemes. Hence it is written: WHEN THE ROBBER <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">8</font></a> BLESSES HE BLASPHEMES THE LORD.  
 <p>3. Another explanation: HE WHO PRAISES THE <i>BOṢEA</i> <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">9</font></a> BLASPHEMES THE LORD.</p>  
 <p><i>Boṣea</i> refers to the brethren of Joseph who said: <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">10</font></a> WHAT <i>BEṢA</i> HAVE WE IF WE SLAY OUR BROTHER?</p></dir>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</font></span></p><dir>R. Jehoshua, <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a> the son of Karha, said: There is a command that we arbitrate, for it is written: <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">2</font></a> EXECUTE THE JUDGMENT OF TRUTH AND PEACE IN YOUR GATES. But is it not the case that wherever there is true judgment there is no peace? And where there is peace there is no true judgment? Then what is the true judgment wherein is peace? This can only be arbitration. And it is written of David: <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">3</font></a> AND DAVID ACTED WITH JUDGMENT AND CHARITY <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">4</font></a> TO ALL HIS PEOPLE. And is it not the case that wherever there is judgment there is no charity? And where there is charity there is no judgment? Then what is the judgment wherein is charity? This can only be arbitration.  
 <p>4. When judgment has been given in a case, justifying him who was in the right, and condemning him who was in the wrong, if it be a poor man who has been condemned the judge sends him away and gives him support out of his own pocket. He is thus found acting with judgment to the one and with charity to the other.</p>  
 <p>5. Rabbi says: When judgment has been given in a case, justifying him who was in the right, and condemning him who was in the wrong, charity is dealt to him who was in the wrong since what was stolen is taken from him; and judgment is meted out to him who was in the right, since what was his is restored to him.</p>  
 <p>6. R. Shimeon, <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">5</font></a> the son of Menasia, says: There are certain times when a man may act as arbitrator</p></dir>

If two men were to come before another for judgment, and he, before he have heard their words, or even after he have heard their words, be unable to determine whom the legal verdict will favour, it is right that he should say to them: Go and arbitrate between yourselves. But if, when he has heard their words, he knows whom the legal verdict will favour, it is not right that he should tell them to go and arbitrate; for it is written: <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a> THE BEGINNING OF STRIFE IS AS WHEN ONE LETTETH OUT WATER; THEREFORE BEFORE THE MATTER IS LAID BARE <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> LEAVE OFF CONTENTION. Before the verdict is apparent thou art free to abandon the case; afterwards thou art not free.  
 <p>7. R. Jehuda, <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">3</font></a> the son of Lakish, said: If two men, a strong one and a weak one, were to come before another for judgment, and he, before he have heard their words, or even after he have heard them, be unable to determine whom the legal verdict will favour, it is right that he should say to them: I cannot allow myself to be implicated in your case, lest the weak be found guilty and the strong persecute him. But if, when he have heard their words, he knows whom the legal verdict will favour, it is not right that he should say: I cannot allow myself to be implicated in your case. For it is written: <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">4</font></a> YE SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF THE FACE OF MAN, FOR THE JUDGMENT IS GOD'S.</p>  
 <p>8. Said R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha: Whence do we know that if a man were sitting before the judge, and knew that a poor man (though condemned) was innocent and a rich man (though acquitted) was guilty, he should not keep silence?</p></dir>

 <p>9. The judges should know whom they are judging and before whom they are judging and who He is who is judging with them. And the witnesses should know against whom they are testifying and with whom they are testifying and who He is who bears testimony with them, as it is written: <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a> THEN BOTH THE MEN BETWEEN WHOM THE CONTROVERSY IS, SHALL STAND BEFORE THE LORD. And also it is written: <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">3</font></a> GOD STANDS IN THE CONGREGATION OF GOD, AND IN THE MIDST OF JUDGES <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">4</font></a> HE JUDGES. So again it is said concerning Jehoshaphat: <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">5</font></a> CONSIDER WHAT YE DO, FOR YE JUDGE NOT FOR MAN BUT FOR GOD. And lest a judge should say, "Why do I take this trouble?"--has it not been said, <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">5</font></a> HE IS WITH YOU IN THE MATTER OF JUDGMENT? Thy concern is only with what thine eyes see.</p>  
 <p>R. Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel, says: As three judges are required for legal judgment, so three judges are required for arbitration. Greater is the force of arbitration than that of legal judgment; for if two judges have given a legal decision the parties are not thereby bound, <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">6</font></a> whereas if arbitration has been effected by two judges the parties are bound.</p>  
 <p>II. 1. The hallowing of the month and the intercalation of the year are determined by three judges,--so R. Meir; but the majority hold that in the intercalation of the year the case is begun by three, discussed by five, and concluded by seven. If one is in favour of considering the necessity of intercalation</p></dir>

If two are in favour of considering it and one not, two more are added, and the five discuss the matter. If two say that it is necessary to intercalate and three not, they proceed no further; the two remain in a minority. If three say that it is necessary and two not, two more are added and the matter is decided by the seven; for the body that effects the decision cannot be less than seven. If a father be in favour of intercalating and his son not, the two are reckoned as two; if both father and son are in favour of intercalating or of not intercalating, the two count as one. Said R. Jose: Once, I and Eleazar, my son, went up to intercalate the year, and I said to him, My son, you and I will only count as one.  
 <p>2. There are three signs which make it evident that the year should be intercalated: the premature state of the corn-crops, the undeveloped state of the tree products, and the lateness of the spring equinox. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the basis of any two of these they may intercalate, but not on one only; though if they were to intercalate on the basis of one only the intercalation would hold good If the premature state of the corn-crops be one of the signs, they rejoice. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">2</font></a> R. Shimeon the son of Gamaliel says: Also if it be the lateness of the spring equinox.</p>  
 <p>3. On the basis of evidence derived from three countries used they to intercalate the year: Judaea, the land beyond Jordan, and Galilee. They may intercalate on the basis of two of these, but not of one only; though in this latter case the intercalation would hold good. And if Judaea were one of the two they rejoiced, because it was from there that the offering of the firstfruits came.</p>  
 <p>4. The years could not be intercalated owing to</p></dir>

 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</font></span>the fact that the season of the kids or lambs or pigeons had not yet arrived; such could only be regarded as a subsidiary reason for intercalating. But if the intercalation has been made on the basis of this evidence, the intercalation holds good. 5. R. Jannai <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">1</font></a> said in the name of Rabban Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel: He used to say: "In that the pigeons are still tender and the spring lambs thin, it is fitting in my opinion to add thirty days to this year."  
 <p>6. It happened once with Rabban Gamaliel <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the elders, that they were sitting on the steps in the Temple Mount, with Johanan the scribe on the one side in front of them. They said to him: Write to our brethren of Upper and Lower Galilee, "May your peace be increased! We make known to you that the time of removal of produce is arrived, for paying tithes from the olive vats." And to our brethren of the upper and lower regions of the South, "May your peace be increased! We make known to you that the time of removal of produce is arrived, for paying tithes from the sheaves of corn." And to our brethren, the exiles of Babylon, and those in exile in Media, and all the other Israelites in exile, "May your peace be increased! We make known to you that the pigeons are still tender and the lambs thin, and that the season of spring is not yet come. It seems fitting to me and to my colleagues that we add to this year thirty days."</p>  
 <p>7. The year is not to be intercalated unless the spring equinox is still distant the greater part of a month. How much is the greater part of a month?</p></dir>

Jehuda says Two thirds of a month, twenty days. R. Jose says: Account is taken of the year and if, before Passover, there still lack sixteen days of the equinox, they intercalate another month. They may not make the intercalation before the Feast of Tabernacles in the same circumstances; <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">1</font></a> but R. Shimeon holds that they may. They may not make an intercalation before the New Year Feast, and if they do it is not valid. But when the need arises they intercalate immediately after the New Year. And even then they can only intercalate Adar. <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">2</font></a>  
 <p>8. They may not intercalate less or more than a month, and if they do it is not valid. They may not intercalate for a year in advance, and if they do it is not valid. And they may not intercalate successive years. R. Shimeon says: They may intercalate successive years; for it happened with R. Akiba <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">3</font></a> that when he was shut up in prison, he</p></dir>

 <p>9. They may not intercalate a Sabbatic year, nor the year that follows. In such cases it is customary to intercalate the year preceding the Sabbatic year.</p>  
 <p>They may not intercalate a year when there is a famine. R. Meir says: It is written, AND THERE CAME A MAN FROM BAAL-SHALISHA AND BROUGHT THE MAN OF GOD BREAD OF THE FIRSTFRUITS, TWENTY LOAVES OF BARLEY, AND FRESH EARS OF CORN IN HIS SACK, <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">1</font></a> etc. But is it not true that there is no place where the produce is ready sooner than at Baal-Shalisha? And even so, he only offered as firstfruits that species which he brought to the man of God. Perhaps he brought it before the time of offering the sheaf? Scripture says: AND HE SAID, GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE, THAT THEY MAY EAT <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">2</font></a>--showing that he only brought it after that it was in the sheaf. And was not that year fitted to be intercalated? <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">3</font></a> And why did not Elisha intercalate it? Because it was a year of famine, and all the people were running to the threshing floors.</p>  
 <p>10. They may not intercalate a year when there is impurity. (But) it happened with Hezekiah the king that he did intercalate a year when there was impurity, as it is written: FOR A MULTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE, EVEN THE MEN OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH, ISSACHAR AND ZEBULUN, HAD NOT CLEANSED THEMSELVES, YET THEY DID EAT THE PASSOVER OTHERWISE THAN IT IS WRITTEN. FOR HEZEKIAH HAD PRAYED FOR THEM SAYING, THE LORD PARDON EVERY ONE, <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">4</font></a> etc. 11. (Therefore) R.

R. Shimeon, <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a> the son of Jehuda, said in the name of R. Shimeon: Also because he caused the congregation to celebrate a second Passover. <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">3</font></a>  
 <p>12.

He carried on Akiba's labours in the codifying of the Mishnah, and his material provided the basis for the final form which it took under the hands of Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nasi. He was <i>Hakam</i>, "advising <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a> sage" or "speaker" (see note on <i>T</i>. vii. 7) to the Sanhedrin at Usha under Rabban Shimeon b. Gamaliel II. So great was his reputation that he refused to submit to the ceremonial introduced by Rabban Shimeon to parade the dignity of the office of Patriarch (the ceremony was that described in <i>T</i>. vii. 8), and retired to Asia Minor.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_27"></a><a href="tsa03.htm#fr_27">24:5</a> The Jewish months are still lunar months, twelve of which only total 354 days, 8 hours, or nearly 11 days short of the solar year.

The Second tithe need not be conveyed to Jerusalem in kind, but might be converted into money (and reconverted at Jerusalem), Deut. 22. 26.

 <p><a name="fn_75"></a><a href="tsa03.htm#fr_76">33:3</a> R. Akiba was perhaps the greatest figure in Jewish literature during the early part of the second century. His teachers were R. Jehoshua b. Hanania and R. Eliezer h. Hyrcanus; while among his pupils were numbered such men as R. Meir, R. Jose b. Halafta and R. Shimeon b. Jochai. He was closely connected with the revolt of Bar Kokba, and met his death at the hands of the Romans. He is chiefly responsible for the final form which the canon of the Old Testament has taken, and it was he who began the process of collecting the mass of oral tradition which was continued by R. Meir and completed by R. Jehuda ha-Nasi. He was also the initiator of a type of exegesis which carried the theory of verbal inspiration to its extreme conclusions: not only every sentence, but every word, every particle, every letter, and even every peculiar form of a letter was possessed of a special divine significance, and from every such detail an endless series of conclusions might be derived, far removed from the mere literal meaning conveyed by the verse.</p>
