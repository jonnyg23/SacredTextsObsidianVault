If an ox have caused death--and it is all one whether it be an ox or any other beast or living creature or bird that has caused death--its death is at the hands of twenty-three judges. R. Eleazar says: If an ox have caused death, its death is at the hands of twenty-three judges; but in the case of the rest of beasts and living creatures and birds, any one who kills them before trial acquires merit in the sight of Heaven. For it is written: AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST; and again: THE BEAST YE SHALL SLAY.  
 <p>2. The ox subject to the penalty of stoning is to be tried by twenty-three, for it is written: THE OX SHALL BE STONED AND ITS MASTER ALSO SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH; as is the death of the master, so is the death of the ox. As the death of the master is by stoning and being thrown down and at the hands of twenty-three judges, so the death</p></dir>

 <p>3. What is the difference between the trial of the ox and the trial of the man? In the case of the ox they may begin the case on one day and finish the same night; or begin and finish the case during the same day, no matter whether they are arriving at a verdict of innocent or guilty; they may decide by a majority of one whether for conviction or acquittal; all may argue in favour either of conviction or acquittal; and he who had urged acquittal may change and urge conviction. <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a> But in the case of the man, all such procedure is illegal.</p></dir>
