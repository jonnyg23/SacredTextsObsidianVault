 <p>R.

 <p>R.

But it was replied: The court at that time did not possess accurate knowledge.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. IX. 11 <i>a</i>. Said R. Eleazar, the son of R. Zadok: When I was a child I was once carried on my father's shoulder to see a priest's daughter who had committed adultery; they surrounded her with faggots and so burnt her. They replied: Thou wast a child, and a child cannot give evidence.</dir>

 <p>R. Jehuda said: Such a death is too shameful; on the contrary, a man's head is placed on the block and cut off with an axe. But it was replied: There is no death more shameful than this.</p>

And how do we do this for him? His bead is placed on an executioner's block and chopped off with a hatchet.  
 <p>To this it was replied: There is no death more disgraceful than this; moreover such should not be done since it is written: IN THEIR ORDINANCES YE SHALL NOT WALK. <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">2</font></a></p></dir>

 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_289">93:3</a> In descending order of severity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_290">93:4</a> <i>Decollatio</i> was not the only death penalty in use at the time in the Roman Empire: see <i>Tac. Ann</i>. ii. 32; Suetonius, <i>Nero</i> 49, <i>Claud</i>. 34.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_291">94:1</a> R. Jehuda's amendment is to avoid the possibility of death taking place by strangulation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_292">94:2</a> Lev. 21. 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_290"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_293">95:1</a> Lev. 19. 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_291"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_294">95:2</a> Lev. 18. 3. But according to the <i>Mishnah</i> already quoted the correct method was "after the usage of the Roman Empire." In the Cod. Vienna and Venice ed. the difficulty is partly avoided by the reading, "He (R. Jehuda) said to them: And though there be no more disgraceful death, still it is written 'And in their ordinances, etc.'"</p>
 <p><a name="fn_292"></a><a href="tsa17.htm#fr_295">95:3</a> This Rabbinic penalty is applied mentioned those criminals for the decreed in the Pentateuch without specifying the mode of death. In regard to these it is argued (B. 52<i>b</i>, 53<i>a</i>) that since the Law must not be construed with severity, the most lenient form of death, a. e. strangulation, must be applied. Another line of argument is: Sometimes "death at the hands of Heaven" is ordained (Gen. 38. 7, 10; Lev. 10. 7, 9); and as death from Heaven leaves no visible marks, so must the death inflicted by the tribunal leave no mark. And such is only possible by death from strangulation.</p>
