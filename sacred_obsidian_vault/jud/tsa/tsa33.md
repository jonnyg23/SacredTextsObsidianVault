 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>IX. 1<i>a</i>. These are punishable by burning: he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter, <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">1</font></a> and a priest's daughter <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">2</font></a> (who has committed adultery). The term "a woman and her daughter" includes a man's own daughter, his daughter's or son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her daughter's or son's daughter, his mother-in-law, the mother of his father-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. XII. 1. These are they who are to be burnt he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter, and a priest's daughter who is bound to a husband. Whether a man have criminal connexion with a woman and afterwards with her daughter, or with a daughter first and afterwards with her mother, he is alike guilty.  
 <p>Although we have no express sanction from Scripture that he is to be burnt who has criminal connexion with the daughter of one who is not his legal wife--the passage in Scripture: AND THE MAN WHO SHALL TAKE (<i>i.e.</i> "marry") A WOMAN AND HER MOTHER, IT IS LEWDNESS, <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">3</font></a> dealing with actual marriage--Scripture says: AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY MAN (OR) PRIEST, <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">4</font></a> to include every case.</p>  
 <p>2. A betrothed damsel and a priest's daughter who has committed adultery are to be stoned. R. Shimeon says that they are to be burnt.</p></dir>
