 <p>V. I. Witnesses were examined by seven queries: In what Sabbatic period? In what year? In what month? On what day of the month? On what day? At what hour? and, Where? According to R. Jose the queries were: On what day? At what hour? Where? Do you recognize him? Did you warn him? And, in the case of idolatry, they were asked, What idol was worshipped? <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">2</font></a> and, How was it worshipped?</p>  
 <p>2. The judge who cross-examines at great length is deserving of praise. Ben Zakkai <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">3</font></a> once carried his cross-examination into details about fig-stalks!</p>  
 <p>What is the difference between "queries" and "cross-examination"? If, during the queries, one answered, "I do not know," <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">4</font></a> the testimony of the witnesses is worthless; but if, in cross-examination, one say, "I do not know," or if two say, "We do not <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">5</font></a> know," their evidence holds good. Yet</p>

 <p>R. Jose says: "The judges need not ask in what Sabbatic period? In what month? On what day of the month? but only, On what day? At what hour? In what place? Do you recognize him? Did you warn him? With what did he kill him? Did he kill him with a sword? Did he kill him with a stick? Did he strike him on the leg? Did he strike him intentionally on 'the bird of life'? <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">1</font></a> In what direction was he looking when he killed him?" <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">2</font></a></p></dir>

If one say "on the second of the month" and another "on the third," their evidence holds good, since one and not the other may have known of an intercalation of the month. If one say "at the second hour" and the other "at the third," their evidence is valid. If one say "at the third hour" and the other "at the fifth," their evidence is invalid. R. Jehuda, however, maintains that it is valid; though if one say "at the fifth hour" and the other "at the seventh," their evidence is invalid, since at the fifth hour the sun is in the east, and at the seventh it is in the west.</p>

If one say "at the third hour" and the other "at the fifth," their evidence is invalid. R. Jehuda, however, says: "In that case their evidence is valid; though if one say 'at the fifth hour' and the other 'at the seventh,' their evidence is invalid, for all must know that at the fifth hour the sun is in the east, and at the seventh in the west."</dir>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>V. 4. The second witness was also brought in and examined. If their testimony is found to agree, they open the case for the defence. If one of the witnesses say "I have something to plead in favour of his acquittal," or if one of the disciples say, "I have something to plead in favour of his conviction," he is silenced. But if a disciple say, "I have something to plead in favour of his acquittal," he is brought up and given a place with the judges, where he remains all day. If there is reason in his plea he is listened to. Even if the accused say that he has something to plead in his own defence he is listened to, but only if his words are reasonable.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>B. IX. 1 <i>c</i>. If the evidence of the witnesses is found to agree, the chief judge opens the case for the defendant, and his fellow judges support him.</dir>

He who had previously urged conviction may now acquit, but he who had previously urged acquittal cannot now turn and urge conviction. If any err in this matter the judges' clerks must remind them.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. IX. 1 <i>d</i>. If they have found for the defendant they set him free; if not, his case is passed over till the morrow. The judges then go apart in pairs and take food--but they drink no wine--and discuss all night the section of Scripture bearing on the case: if it was a case of murder, they discuss the section dealing with murder; <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">1</font></a> if a case of incest, they discuss the section dealing with incest. <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">2</font></a> On the morrow they come early to the court, and the officers call on each judge to give his verdict. If one answer, "I acquitted yesterday and still acquit," his decision is accepted; if he say, "I acquitted yesterday, but now I convict," such a decision is not accepted. If he say, "I convicted yesterday, but now I acquit," his decision is accepted; if he say, "I convicted yesterday and I still convict," they say to him, "Study thy words anew." If one of those who now acquit have changed his former opinion the judges’ scribes remind him of what he said before; but if one of those who now convict have changed his former opinions they do not remind him, but say to him, "Study thy words anew."</dir>  
 <p>V. 5 <i>b</i>. If acquitted (by all the judges) the accused M. is set free; if not, the matter is decided by vote. If twelve acquit and eleven convict, he is to be acquitted; if twelve convict and eleven acquit, <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">3</font></a> or</p>

To what extent are they increased? Two by two until seventy-one is reached. If thirty-six acquit and thirty-five convict, he is to be acquitted; if thirty-six convict and thirty-five acquit, <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a> the case is tried over among themselves until one of those who convict agrees with those who acquit.</p>

If thirty-six convict and thirty-five acquit, they try the case over among themselves until one of those who convict say, "I agree with those who acquit."  
 <p>3. If one of the disciples say, "I have something to plead on behalf of the defendant," the judges accept him in a friendly way and bring him up and seat him with them. If there be reason in his plea they include him as a judge, and he remains with them always; and if not, he still remains with them the whole of that day, so that his rise should not be his fall.</p>  
 <p>4. If one say, "I have something to plead on behalf of the defendant," they listen to him; but if it be against the interests of the defendant, they silence him with a rebuke.</p>  
 <p>A witness cannot plead either for or against the defendant; but R. Jose, the son of R. Jehuda, says that he may plead for, but not against, the defendant.</p>
