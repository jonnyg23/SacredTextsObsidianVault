These may be saved (from sin) at the cost of their lives: <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">1</font></a> he who pursues after his fellow to kill him, or after a male, or after a betrothed damsel. But he who pursues after a beast, or he who defiles the Sabbath, or he who commits idolatry, may not be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. XI. 10. He who pursues after his fellow (to kill him) may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life. How do they do this? They wound one of his limbs; and if even so they cannot prevent him, they forthwith kill him.  
 <p>11. He who pursues after a male, whether it be in a house or the open field, may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life; if it be after a betrothed damsel, whether in a house or the open field, he may be so killed. If it be a betrothed damsel or any of the prohibited degrees enjoined in the Law, he may be so killed; but if it be a divorced widow of a high-priest, or an ordinary priest's wife who had been subjected to the <i>ḥaliṣa</i> ceremony, he may not be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life. R. Jehuda says: Also, should she say, "Let him alone!" he may not be so killed, even though by leaving him alone he commit a capital crime.</p>  
 <p>R. Eleazar, the son of R. Zadok, says: He who commits idolatry may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life.</p></dir>
