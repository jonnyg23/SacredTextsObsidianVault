 <p>M. VIII. 2. When does he become guilty? When he eats a <i>tritimor</i> <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">3</font></a> of flesh, and drinks a half <i>log</i> <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Italian <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">5</font></a> wine; or, according to R.

 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. XI. 6b. Even one who furnishes his table as though it were a banquet of Solomon, if it be at its proper season, is not adjudged a stubborn and rebellious son; unless he put in his mouth the (forbidden) amount, or do similarly at a public meal.</dir>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>VIII. 3. If he steal aught from his father and eat it in his father's domain; or anything from others and eat it in his father's domain; or anything from others and eat it in the others’ domain,--he is not a stubborn and rebellious son;--not until he steals what belongs to his father and eats it in another's domain. R. Jose, <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a> the son of Jehuda, holds: Not until he steals from his father and from his mother.</p>  
 <p>4. If his father concur and not his mother, or his mother concur and not his father, he is not a stubborn and rebellious son;--not until they both concur in his condemnation. According to R. Jehuda, if his mother be not suited <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">2</font></a> to his father he cannot become a stubborn and rebellious son. If either of them be maimed in the hands, lame, dumb, blind, or deaf, he cannot become a stubborn and rebellious son, for it is written: THEY SHALL SEIZE HIM--so they must not be maimed in the hands; AND MAKE HIM GO--so they must not be lame; AND SAY--so they must not be dumb; THIS OUR SON--so they must not</p>

 <p>VIII. 4. If he has been warned in the presence of three witnesses and beaten, and again becomes degenerate, he must be tried by twenty-three judges; but he cannot be stoned unless the first three witnesses are there, for it is written, THIS OUR SON, as if to say, "This is he who was beaten in your presence."</p>  
 <p>If he escape away before his trial be completed and afterward the lower beard become encompassed, he is free. But if he escape away after his trial is completed and then the lower beard become encompassed, he is liable to the penalty.</p>  
 <p>5. A stubborn and rebellious son is condemned in view of what he might afterwards become. Let him die innocent and let him not die guilty. For the death of the ungodly is a benefit to them and a benefit to the whole world; but that of the righteous is a misfortune to them and a misfortune to the whole world. When the ungodly indulge in wine and sleep, it is a benefit to them and a benefit to the whole world; but when the righteous so indulge, it is a misfortune to them and a misfortune to the whole world. The isolation of the ungodly is a benefit to them and a benefit to the whole world, but in the case of the righteous it is a misfortune to them and a misfortune to the whole world.

 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. XI. 7. A stubborn and rebellious son, a defiant elder, a beguiler to idolatry, one who leads a town astray, a false prophet, and perjurers, are not killed at once but brought up to the great court at Jerusalem and kept in prison till a feast and killed at a feast, for it is written: AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR AND FEAR, AND DO NO MORE PRESUMPTUOUSLY, <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">2</font></a>--so R. Meir; but R. Jehuda said to him: "Ought it not then to say, 'All the people shall see and fear'? But it is not so written but 'ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR AND FEAR.' Then why should they postpone such a one's death? Therefore they kill him at once, and write and send everywhere, saying 'The trial of N. has been completed in such and such a court, and N. and N. are his witnesses; such and such has been done to him."  
 <p>8. R. Shimeon, the son of Jehuda, says in the name of Shimeon: Beauty and power and wisdom and wealth and old age and glory and honour and sons, are good for the righteous and good for the whole world; for it is written, OLD AGE IS A CROWN OF GLORY, <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">3</font></a> and CHILDREN'S CHILDREN ARE THE CROWN OF OLD MEN, <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">4</font></a> and THE GLORY OF YOUNG MEN IS THEIR STRENGTH, <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">5</font></a> and BEFORE HIS ELDERS IS HONOUR. <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">6</font></a> R.
