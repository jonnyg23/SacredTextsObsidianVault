 <p>(1) He who has criminal connexion with his mother <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">2</font></a> is guilty both in respect of the law of the mother and the law of the father's wife. R. Jehuda holds that he is guilty in respect of the law of the mother only. (2) He who has criminal connexion with his father's wife <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">3</font></a> is thereby guilty both in respect of the law of the father's wife and that of the married woman, whether before or after his father's death, whether she be betrothed or actually married. (3) He who has criminal connexion with his daughter-in-law <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">4</font></a> is thereby guilty in respect both of the law of a man's daughter-in-law and that of a married woman, whether it be before or after his son's death, whether she be betrothed or actually married.

Since by its means an offence has happened to a human being, Scripture says: LET IT BE STONED. <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">3</font></a> Or, according to another explanation, (it is put to death) lest the beast should go through the street and it be said: This is the animal on account of which such a man was stoned.</p>
