And another explanation is; ROOT means the soul, and BRANCH means the body.  
 <p>2. The children of the wicked among the heathen shall not live (in the world to come), nor shall they be judged. But R. Eliezer holds: None of the heathen has any share in the world to come, for it is written: THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO <i>SHEOL</i>, ALL THE HEATHEN THAT FORGET GOD. <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">5</font></a> " THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO <i>SHEOL</i>,"--these are the wicked in Israel; "ALL THE HEATHEN THAT FORGET GOD,"--these are the wicked among the heathen. R. Jehoshua said to him, "If Scripture had said: THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO SHEOL, ALL THE HEATHEN, and then said no more, I should have spoken according to thy words; but since Scripture says: WHO FORGET GOD, behold there must be righteous men among the heathen who have a share in the world to come."</p>
