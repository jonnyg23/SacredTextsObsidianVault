 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/binit1.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>BY A fitting answer to the questions of each of the four types of the sons of Israel, does the Torah explain the meaning of this night's celebration.  
 <p>The wise son eager to learn asks earnestly: "What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances, which the Lord our God hath commanded us?" To him thou shalt say: "This service is held in order to worship the Lord our God, that it may be well with us all the days of our life".</p>  
 <p>The wicked son inquires in a mocking spirit: "What mean <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ye</span> by this service?" As he says <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ye</span> and not <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">we</span>, he excludes himself from the household of Israel. Therefore thou shouldst turn on him and say: "It is because of that which the Lord did for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">me</span> when I came forth out of Egypt". For <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">me</span> and not for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">him</span>, for had he been there, he would not have been found worthy of being redeemed.</p>

 <p>The simple son indifferently asks: "What is this?" To him thou shalt say: "By strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage".</p>  
 <p>And for the son who is unable to inquire, thou shalt explain the whole story of the Passover; as it is said: "And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying 'It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt'".</p>
