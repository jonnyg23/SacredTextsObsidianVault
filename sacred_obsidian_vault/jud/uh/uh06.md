 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/oinit.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>ON the table, in front of the person who conducts the service, place  
 <p>A large platter containing Seder symbols:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">a. Three matzos each of which is covered separately in the folds of a napkin or special cover. Two of them represent the "Leḥem Mishnehdouble portion" of the Sabbath and the holy days, and the third the "Leḥem Onibread of affliction". These are also taken to represent the three religious divisions of Israel: the "Cohen" (priest), "Levi" (associate priest) and "Yisroel" (lay-Israelite).  
 <p>b. The roasted shank-bone (of a lamb).</p>  
 <p>c. A roasted egg.</p>  
 <p>Also a piece of horseradish, a bit of haroses, and a spray of parsley.</p></div>  
 <p>Besides these, there are placed on the table for the company:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">1. A plate of bitter herbs (horseradish), cut into small pieces.  
 <p>2. A dish of haroses.</p>  
 <p>3. Parsley or watercress.</p>  
 <p>4. A dish of salt water.</p></div>  
 <p><a name="page_xv"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xv</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">5. A cup of wine is placed at each plate, and a large brimming goblet in the center of the table for the prophet Elijah.</div>  
 <p>The meal served during the Seder follows the form of a banquet of olden times. Hence the reference, in the Hebrew texts of the Four Questions, to the custom of reclining on the left sidea position assumed by free men. Preserving this custom, many households still provide a large cushioned armchair for the person conducting the Seder.</p>  
 <p>The table is usually spread with the best of the family's china and silverware, and adorned with flowers, in keeping with the festive spirit.</p>
