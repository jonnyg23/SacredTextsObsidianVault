 <h1 align="CENTER">My Trip to Mars</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">by William Ferguson</h2>
 <h4 align="CENTER">[1955, no renewal]</h4>

 <p>
 This is a short account by an early UFO contactee.
 Mr. Ferguson, who also wrote a pamphlet called <i>Relax First,</i>
 tells us without any trace of irony that
 'I had become adept at the art of relaxation.'
 One day in 1938, while 'relaxing,' he has an out-of-body
 experience, during which he takes a trip to Mars and meets
 its kindly, optimistic inhabitants.
 Naturally, they have a epochal message for Mr. Ferguson...
