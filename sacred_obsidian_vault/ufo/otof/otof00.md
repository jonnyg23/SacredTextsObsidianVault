 <p>Mrs. Williamson, the former Betty Jane Hettler, is a chemist and an anthropologist, holding an A.S. degree from Grand Rapids Junior College; a B.S. degree from Eastern New Mexico University; and a B.A. degree from the University of Arizona. Both are members of the American Anthropological Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>  <h3 align="center">FRONT FLAP TEXT</h3>  
 <p>In more recent times, there has been a growing realization that on other worlds than ours, even in other universes, there are other living beings. The idea that earthbound man may someday journey into the heavens to discover other men and women, like or unlike himself, "grows by leaps and bounds. Within man's soul lies the truth--mortals exist on other spheres!</p>  
 <p>Here is a book that brings home this tremendous fact with a dynamic force and sweep that will astound the reader, and convince him beyond all doubt. Here is a <i>history</i>, a collection of <i>proof</i>, and a tremendous <i>theory</i>.</p>  
 <p>While man in his heart knows that other worlds are also inhabited, he is reluctant to admit that Earth is only one small house of the "many mansions" in the Father's house. But the truth stares him in he face, and now, having arrived at a place in his civilization where only Truth will be able to survive, it has become necessary to reaffirm</p>

 <p>In this book, many references and quotations are given from the latest authentic reports on Saucer phenomena. Because many believe there are contradictions in some of the reported happenings, it has been necessary to show that there is a great story and purpose behind all these experiences.</p>  
 <p>Here, in this book, is the history of <i>other tongues</i>, and of <i>other flesh</i>; calm, scientific evidence that there are brothers of ours in the skies overhead.</p>  
 <p>We are not alone in the Universe!</p>
