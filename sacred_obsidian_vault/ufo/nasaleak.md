 Things to beware of in 1997:
 
 Gradual acclimation of the public to the idea of 'extraterrestrial
 life', possibly in the form of us somehow being martian progeny, all
 for dubious political ends.

 Rich Boylan originally posted the information from Dr. Bergrun, which was
 obtained from a radio interview, and I posted it to other newsgroups to find
 out if anyone could provide any additional information. William Wilson was
 able to obtain the following information:

 Science News reported on 02-03-96 (V 149, No.5 p.71) that several objects
 in Saturns orbit has been viewed by the Hubble telescope on May 22 and
 August 10, 1996.
 "From Hubble images taken during the Aug. 10 crossing, Phillip D.
 Nicholson of Cornell University and his colleagues detected two never seen
 before bodies as well as S3. The team has concluded that none is a moon.
 Nicholson says the objects must have been created during the last 14
 years, because they are too big and bright for the Voyager craft to have
 overlooked them during the Saturn flybys in the early 1980's. In addition,
 the brightest of the three bodies is elongated, unlike a satellite. All
 three objects seem to have disapperared by Nov. 21......"
 
 Recall the first reference to this elongate "space craft" was seen by
 Voyager imaging according to Dr. Bergrun, a retired NASA scientist
 interviewed on a recent radio talk show in Greenville South Carolina on
 January 30, 1996. I called Dr. Bergrun concerning this statement and his
 book and he verified the the facts that were revealled on the interview.
 
 This is a very significant revelation from two different sources
 completely separated from each other. I find this a facinating
 correlation.
 
 No moon or discovered object has ever "disappered" in the history of
 astronomy that was the size described by Dr. Bergrun and images discovered
 by the Earth orbiting Hubble telescope. This should be a starting point
 for a lot hard questions put to NASA.
