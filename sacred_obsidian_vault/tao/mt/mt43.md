 <p>The movements of the Tao are cyclical; the sufficiency of the Tao is latency. <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>All that is, <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">2</font></a> exists in being (bhava), being in non-being. <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">"So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth; and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how. The earth yieldeth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear." "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof." "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened."</div>
