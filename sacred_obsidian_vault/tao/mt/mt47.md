 <p>Fame or life, which is dearer? Life or wealth, which is more? Gain or loss, which is worse?</p>  
 <p>Excessive love implies excessive outlay. Immoderate accumulation implies heavy loss. <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who knows contentment meets no shame. Who knows when to stop incurs no danger. Such long endure.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">We possess nothing more valuable than our ideals, but the only ideal which is not immoderate is that ideal content which is content with nothing for self; to stop short of this is to linger where danger lurks. Mystics of all ages, irrespective of their religious profession have realized this. A few paragraphs from a Spanish Catholic of the sixteenth century—Saint Jean de la Croix—will illustrate Lao-tzu's thought:  
 <p>“To enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.</p>  
 <p>“To know all things, learn to know nothing.</p>  
 <p>“To possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.</p>  
 <p>“To be all things, be willing to be nothing.</p>  
 <p>“To get to where you have no taste for anything, go through whatever experiences you have no taste for.</p>  
 <p>“To learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.</p>  
 <p>“To reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.</p>  
 <p>“To be what you are not, experience what you are not.</p>  
 <p>“When you stop at anything, you cease to open yourself to the All.</p>  
 <p>“For to come to the All, you must give up the All.</p>  
 <p>“And if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it, desiring Nothing.” <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>With this compare an hitherto untranslated saying by Lu Hui-neng, the sixth and last Chinese Buddhist Patriarch: "To be able to separate one's self from all affections is the pith of tranquillity."</p></div>
