 <p>When one uses the Tao in assisting his sovereign, he will not employ arms to coerce the state. Such methods easily react. <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Where military camps are established briers and thorns flourish. When great armies have moved through the land calamities are sure to follow. <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>The capable are determined, but no more. They will not venture to compel; determined, but not conceited; determined, but not boastful; determined, but not arrogant; determined because it cannot be helped; determined, but not forceful.</p>  
 <p>When things reach their prime, they begin to age. This cannot be said to be the Tao. What is NOT the Tao soon ends. <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">War is crude, unrefined cruelty; a creator of divisions, and an opponent of the unity underlying creation; brute force and strategy are its weapons, each a contradiction of the simplicity and purity of God; its effects extend beyond the physical, and to those who have open ears there come from the Unseen, echoes similar to the lament of the Great Spirit in Hiawatha:  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">"O my children! my poor children!<br>  Listen to the words of wisdom,<br>  From the lips of the Great Spirit,<br>  From the Master of Life, who made you!"  
 <p>"I am weary of your quarrels,<br>  Weary of your wars and bloodshed, <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a><br>  Weary of your prayers for vengeance,<br>  Of your wranglings and divisions;<br>  All your strength is in your union,<br>  All your danger is in discord;<br>  Therefore be at peace henceforward,<br>  And as brothers live together."</p></div>  
 <p>Armies when contending seem to be the most commanding forces in the universe, yet is their strength unequal to the Spiritual Force—electricity.</p></div>
