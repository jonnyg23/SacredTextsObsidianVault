 <p>The Lord says: <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC1"><font size="1">CC1</font></a></p>
 <p>For seventeen generations I have been incarnated <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> as a high mandarin, and I have never oppressed my people nor maltreated my subordinates. I have helped them in misfortune; I have rescued them from poverty; I have taken compassion on their orphans; I have forgiven their transgressions; I have extensively practised secret virtue (<i>yin chih</i>  <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_2"><font size="1">2</font></a>) which is attuned to heaven above. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC2"><font size="1">CC2</font></a> If you are able to keep your hearts as I have kept mine, Heaven will surely bestow upon you blessings. Therefore, these are the instructions I declare unto mankind: <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_3"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>He who wants to expand the field of happiness, <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_4"><font size="1">4</font></a> let him lay the foundation of it on the bottom of his heart. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC7"><font size="1">CC7</font></a></p>
 <p>Practise benevolence <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_5"><font size="1">5</font></a> wherever you find an opportunity, and let your deeds of merit be unheeded (<i>yin</i>).</p>
 <p>Benefit all creatures <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_6"><font size="1">6</font></a>; benefit the people. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC8"><font size="1">CC8</font></a></p>
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>
 <p>Practise goodness: acquire merit.</p>
 <p>Be honest like Heaven in conducting your affairs.</p>
 <p>Compassionate and auspicious, the state government must be devoted to the salvation of the people.</p>
 <p>Let your heart be impartial <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_7"><font size="1">7</font></a> and wide of range. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC9"><font size="1">CC9</font></a></p>
 <p>Fulfil the four obligations <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_8"><font size="1">8</font></a>; impartially observe the three doctrines. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_9"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>
 <p>Be faithful and reverential to the ruler. Be filial and obedient to parents. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC10"><font size="1">CC10</font></a> Be congenial and friendly to brothers. Be sincere in your intercourse with friends. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_10"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>
 <p>Let some worship the Truthful One, <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_11"><font size="1">11</font></a> and revere the Northern Constellation, while others bow before the Buddha and recite sutras. <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC12"><font size="1">CC12</font></a></p>
 <p>By discoursing on morality and righteousness, convert both the cunning and the dull. By preaching on the canonical books and histories, enlighten the ignorant and the benighted.</p>
 <p>Relieve people in distress as speedily as you must release a fish from a dry rill [lest he die]. Deliver people from danger as quickly as you must free a sparrow from a tight noose.</p>
 <p>Be compassionate to orphans and relieve widows. Respect the old and help the poor.</p>
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>
 <p>Promote the good and recommend the wise. Be lenient with others and exacting with yourself.</p>
 <p>Save your clothing and provisions that ye may befriend the hungry and cold on the road.</p>
 <p>Give away coffins and cases lest the dead of the poor be exposed.</p>
 <p>Build charitable graveyards for unclaimed corpses.</p>
 <p>Establish philanthropic institutions for the education of children.</p>
 <p>If your own family is well provided, extend a helping hand to your relatives. If the harvest fails, provide for and relieve your neighbors and friends.</p>
 <p>Let measures and scales be accurate; and be neither chary in selling nor exacting in buying.</p>
 <p>Treat your servants with generosity and consideration. Do not expect perfection nor be too strict in your demands.</p>
 <p>Publish and make known sutras <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_12"><font size="1">12</font></a> and tracts. Build and repair temples and shrines.</p>
 <p>Distribute medicine to alleviate the suffering of the sick. With tea or water relieve the distress of the thirsty.</p>
 <p>Light lanterns in the night to illuminate where people walk. Keep boats on rivers to ferry people across.</p>
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>
 <p>Buy captive animals and give them freedom. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_13"><font size="1">13</font></a> <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC13"><font size="1">CC13</font></a></p>
 <p>How commendable is abstinence <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_14"><font size="1">14</font></a> that dispenses with the butcher!</p>
 <p>While walking be mindful of worms and ants.</p>
 <p>Be cautious with fire and do not set mountain woods or forests ablaze.</p>
 <p>Do not go into the mountain to catch birds in nets, <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_15"><font size="1">15</font></a> nor to the water to poison fishes and minnows.</p>
 <p>Do not butcher the ox that plows thy field.</p>
 <p>Do not throw away paper that is written on. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_16"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>
 <p>Do not scheme for others' property.</p>
 <p>Do not envy others' accomplishments.</p>
 <p>Do not approach thy neighbor's wife or maids.</p>
 <p>Do not stir thy neighbors to litigation.</p>
 <p>Do not injure thy neighbor's reputation or interest.</p>
 <p>Do not meddle with thy neighbor's conjugal affairs.</p>
 <p>Set not, for personal malice, brothers at variance with one another.</p>
 <p>Set not father and son at variance for trifles.</p>
 <p>Never take advantage of your power, nor disgrace the good and law-abiding.</p>
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>
 <p>Presume not, ye that are rich; nor deceive the needy and suffering.</p>
 <p>While attending to your duty, <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_17"><font size="1">17</font></a> be humble and modest.</p>
 <p>Live in concord with your relatives and clansmen.</p>
 <p>Let go hatred <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_18"><font size="1">18</font></a> and forgive malice.</p>
 <p>Those that are good, seek ye for friends; that will help you to practise virtue with body and soul. Those that are wicked, keep at a distance; it will prevent evil from approaching you.</p>
 <p>Pass in silence over things wicked, but promulgate all that is good.</p>
 <p>Do not assert with your mouth what your heart denies. <a name="fr_21:1"></a><a href="#fn_21:1"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>Always have in mind helpful sayings.</p>
 <p>Do not use improper language.</p>
 <p>Cut the brambles and thorns that obstruct the highway. Remove bricks and stones that lie in the path.</p>
 <p>Repair the defiles though for many hundred years they have remained unimproved.</p>
 <p>Build bridges to be traversed by thousands and ten thousands of people.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>
 <p>Expound moral maxims to correct the people's faults.</p>
 <p>Supply the means to give instruction to people of talent.</p>
 <p>Let your work conform to Heaven's reason, <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC14"><font size="1">CC14</font></a> and let your speech express humaneness.</p>
 <p>Keep the ancient sages before your eyes even when at supper or while looking over the fence. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_19"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>
 <p>Be mindful when you are alone <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_14"><font size="1">14</font></a> in the shadow of your coverlet. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_20"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>
 <p>Anything evil refrain ye from doing; <a href="ycw04.htm#xref_CC14"><font size="1">CC14</font></a> all good deeds do! <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_21"><font size="1">21</font></a> So will you be released forever from the influence of evil stars, and always be encompassed by good guardian angels. <a href="ycw05.htm#xref_22"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>
 <p>Rewards may be immediate, and you will receive them in person, or rewards may be remote, and will devolve upon your posterity.</p>
 <p>Blessings come a hundredfold in loads as if drawn by horses; good fortune is piled up a thousandfold like a mass of clouds.</p>
 <p>Do not all these things accrue to the heart of the quiet way?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_21:1"></a><a href="#fr_21:1">21:1</a> This recalls the fact that in Babylon "to say 'Yea' with the mouth, and 'nay' with the heart . . . was repeatedly branded as a sin." See Delitzsch, <i>Babel and Bible: Two Lectures</i>, p. 47, and "Third and Last Lecture" in <i>The Open Court</i>, XX, p. 151. Cf. also the Biblical expression in Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</p>
