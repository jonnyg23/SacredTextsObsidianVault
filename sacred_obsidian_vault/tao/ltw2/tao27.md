 <p>Good walkers need no guides; good speakers do not blame or reproach others; good managers need no rules nor diagrams; good locksmiths are competent to open any lock; good binders can unloose any kind of knot.</p>  
 <p>It is the same with the perfect Sage: he is always competent in giving advice to his people, so that not one becomes an outcast. He is competent in using things, so that nothing is useless to him. His insight detects hidden values. Therefore the competent man is the master of the incompetent, and the incompetent</p>

 <p>are as hands and feet to the competent. The incompetent who does not esteem his master and the competent who does not protect his hands and feet, though he otherwise be intelligent, is acting foolishly. Herein lies the value of intelligence.</p>
