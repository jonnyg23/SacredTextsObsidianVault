 <p>He who understands others is intelligent; he who understands himself is enlightened. He who is able to conquer others is powerful; he who can control himself is more powerful.</p>  
 <p>He who is contented is richer than the richest. Those who have purpose are resolute, and those who keep tranquillity of mind have endurance. Those whose fame endures beyond death are immortal.</p>
