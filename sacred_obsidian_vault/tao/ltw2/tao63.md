 <p>A man's first duty is to practice <i>wu-wei</i> and make use of his quiet hours to gain enlightenment. One should early learn to find sweetness in tasteless things; to discover greatness in small things; to be satisfied with few things.</p>  
 <p>One should respond to hatred with kindness; he should treat little affairs as though they were important. All the world's difficulties arise from slight causes,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>and all the world's great affairs have risen from small beginnings.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, the perfect Sage never asserts his greatness and by so doing attains to true greatness. Rash promises are easily made, but the simpler a thing looks, the harder it is to accomplish. This is a common experience, therefore the perfect Sage considers everything difficult and so to the end has no difficulties.</p>
