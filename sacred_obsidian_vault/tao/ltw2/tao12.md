 <p>If a man indulges his desire for looking at the five beautiful colors, his perception of their beauty will become dull; if a man indulges a desire for listening to the five musical tones, his perception of their music</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>will become dulled; if he indulges a desire for the five pleasant tastes, his perception of their deliciousness will become dull. If a man indulges a desire for racing and hunting, he will lose his appreciation of tranquillity and may become mad. So it is with the lure of hidden treasure that tempts a man to do evil.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the perfect Sage aims at usefulness and is not deceived by the illusions of sense. A man in hunger desires food to satisfy his hunger and is little concerned by its beauty and delicacy.</p>
