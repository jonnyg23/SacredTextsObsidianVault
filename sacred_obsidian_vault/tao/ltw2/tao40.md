 <p>To withdraw the mind from attention to outward things, to be thoughtful, to practice meditation, is to be in conformity with TAO. To be humble and of service to others is, also, being in conformity with TAO. Heaven and earth, and all things are manifestations of existence, but existence, itself, comes from non-existence.
