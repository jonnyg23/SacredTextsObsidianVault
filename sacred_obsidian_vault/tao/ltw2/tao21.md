 <p>All the innumerable forms of <i>teh</i> (power or virtue) correspond to the principle of TAO, but the nature of TAO is to be realized only in a state of mental concentration when the thinking mind is empty and quiescent and the intuitive mind is alert and receptive. Then the spirit reflects reality and realizes its true nature. When the spirit is in an advanced state of tranquillity, there will, be opened a fountain of purest semen available for service which by its special signs can be recognized intuitively. Since the beginning, this generative vitality has ever been available for the creation and nourishment of all things. Moreover, the reason one can comprehend the mystery of Originality is simply because of the fertilization by his same vitality called TAO.</p>
