 <p>As a thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted and as a thing that is well guarded is not easily stolen, so if a family observes the principle of TAO, its descendants will ever hold their ancestors in honor.</p>  
 <p>He who practices TAO for himself will only gain teh for himself. He who practices TAO for the benefit of his family, his teh will pass to his descendants. If he practices TAO for the welfare of his community, his teh will be multiplied. If he practices TAO for the benefit of his country, his teh will become abundantly multiplied. If he practices the principle of TAO for the sake of the whole world, teh will become universal.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, he who practices TAO for himself will</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>only himself be benefited. He who practices it for the sake of his family, will have his family benefited. He who practices it for his community will have his community benefited. He who practices TAO for the whole world will benefit the whole world.</p>  
 <p>How do I know all this? It comes from the practice of TAO.</p>
