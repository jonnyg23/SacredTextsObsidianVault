 <p>When a minister serves a ruler after the principle of TAO, he will not advise a resort to force of arms to become a great nation. Like returns to like. So briars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad years of want and disorder follow a great war.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, the competent ruler, resolutely restraining his desires and ambition, dares not resort to force. Because he is resolute, he will not be boastful, nor haughty, nor arrogant; because he is resolute he will act only under necessity; because he is resolute, he will have no ambition to be powerful.</p>  
 <p>By the nature of things, when the strength of anything is fully developed, it immediately begins to decay. This means that strength is not in accordance</p>

 <p>with the principle of TAO. Being not in accordance with TAO, it will soon pass away.</p>
