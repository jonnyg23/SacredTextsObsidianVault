 <p>When the potentiality of TAO manifests itself, it becomes the mother of all things. When one realizes that his life comes from this universal Mother, he will also realize his brotherhood to all her descendants. When one realizes his descent from the universal Mother and his brotherhood with all humanity, he will cherish his life and thus, to its end, will be kept in perfect health.</p>

 <p>strength. To use one's intelligence to seek enlightenment and to control one's body is to return to the nature of one's origin.</p>
