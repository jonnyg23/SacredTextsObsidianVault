 <p>TAO is invisible but permeates everywhere; no matter how one uses it or how much, it is never exhausted. It is wise for us to imitate its profoundness; that is, to keep ourselves in quiet confidence as being the unfailing source of all things. We should hide our wits and competencies; we should free ourselves from worldly entanglements; keep ourselves always in humility and courtesy; becoming ever more socialized and personally disinterested.</p>  
 <p>Should we attain all of these conditions, we would become as still and as transparent as the pure water of a spring. Then we would not recognize any spiritual forefather because no one would be worthy to be our ancestor except the perfect Father, the Great TAO.</p>
