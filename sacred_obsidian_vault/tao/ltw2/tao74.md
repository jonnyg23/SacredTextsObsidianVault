 <p>If people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by the death penalty? If people are afraid of death, I would seize the one who is not afraid of death and execute him. After that who would dare to disobey?</p>  
 <p>There is always an experienced officer to execute murderers. If an inexperienced person takes his place, it would be like an unskilled man taking the place of a skilled carpenter at his hewing: he is very likely to cut himself.</p>
