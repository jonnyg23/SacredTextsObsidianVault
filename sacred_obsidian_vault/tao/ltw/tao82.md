 <p>Common people are joyful; they celebrate a feast day; they flock to a pavilion in spring time. I alone am calm, as one who has as yet received no omen; I am as a babe who has not learned to smile. I am forlorn, like a homeless wanderer! Common people have plenty; I alone am in want. I am a foolish man at heart! I am <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a> ignorant. Common people are vivacious and smart, I alone am dull and confused.</p>  
 <p>Knowledge of the Tao, how vast! I am like a sailor far beyond a place of anchorage, adrift on a boundless ocean. Common people are useful, I am awkward. I stand in contrast to them--but oh, the prize I seek is food from our Mother Tao!</p>
