 <p>The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The wise man shuts his mouth and closes his gates. He softens his <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> sharpness, unravels his tangles, dims his brilliancy, and reckons himself with the mysterious.</p>  
 <p>He is inaccessible to favor or hate; he cannot be reached by profit or injury; he cannot be honored or humiliated. Thereby he is honored by all.</p>
