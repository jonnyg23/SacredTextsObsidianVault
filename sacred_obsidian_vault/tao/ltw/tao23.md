 <p>Taciturnity is natural to man. A whirlwind never outlasts the morning, nor a violent rain the day. What is the cause? It is heaven and <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a> earth. If even heaven and earth are not constant, much less can man be.</p>  
 <p>Therefore he who pursues his affairs in the spirit of Tao will become Tao-like. He who pursues his affairs with teh, will become teh-like. He who pursues his affairs with loss, identifies himself with loss.</p>  
 <p>He who identifies himself with Tao, Tao rejoices to guide. He who identifies himself with teh, teh rejoices to reward. And he who identifies himself with loss, loss rejoices to ruin.</p>  
 <p>If his faith fail, he will receive no reward of faith.</p>
