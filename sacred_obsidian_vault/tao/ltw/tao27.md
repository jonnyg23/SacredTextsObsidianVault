 <p>Good walkers leave no tracks, good speakers make no errors, good counters need no abacus, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a> good wardens have no need for bolts and locks for no one can get by them. Good binders can dispense with rope and cord, yet none can unloose their hold.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the wise man trusting in goodness always saves men, for there is no outcast to him. Trusting in goodness he saves all things for there is nothing valueless to him. This is recognizing concealed values.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the good man is the instructor of the evil man, and the evil man is the good man's wealth. He who does not esteem his instructors or value his wealth, though he be otherwise intelligent, becomes confused. Herein lies the significance of spirituality.</p>
