 <p>When every one recognizes beauty to be only a masquerade, then it is simply ugliness. In the same way goodness, if it is not sincere, is not goodness. So existence and non-existence are incompatible. The difficult and easy are mutually opposites. Just as the long and the short, <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a> the high and the low, the loud and soft, the before and the behind, are all opposites and each reveals the other.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the wise man is not conspicuous in his affairs or given to much talking. Though troubles arise he is not irritated. He produces but does not own; he acts but claims no merit; he builds but does not dwell therein; and because he does not dwell therein he never departs.</p>
