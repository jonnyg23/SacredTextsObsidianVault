 <p>A military expert has said: I do not dare put myself forward as a host, but always act as a guest. I hesitate to advance an inch, but am willing to withdraw a foot.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>This is advancing by not advancing, it is winning without arms, it is charging without hostility, it is seizing without weapons. There is no mistake greater than making light of an enemy. By making light of an enemy we lose our treasure.</p>  
 <p>Therefore when well-matched armies come to conflict, the one who is conscious of his weakness conquers.</p>
