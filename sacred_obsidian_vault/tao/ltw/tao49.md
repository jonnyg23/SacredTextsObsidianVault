 <p>The wise man has no fixed heart; in the hearts of the people he finds his own. The good he treats <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a> with goodness; the not-good he also treats with goodness, for teh is goodness. The faithful ones he treats with good faith; the unfaithful he also treats with good faith, for teh is good faith.</p>  
 <p>The wise man lives in the world but he lives cautiously, dealing with the world cautiously. He universalizes his heart; the people give him their eyes and ears, but he treats them as his children.</p>
