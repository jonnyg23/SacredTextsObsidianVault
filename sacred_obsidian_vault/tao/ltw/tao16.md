 <p>Seek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the essence of tranquillity).</p>  
 <p>All things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.</p>  
 <p>Knowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.</p>  
 <p>The heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared.</p>
