 <p>He who knows his manhood and understands his womanhood becomes useful like the valleys of earth (which bring water). Being like the valleys of earth, eternal vitality (teh) will not depart from him, he will come again to the nature of a little child.</p>  
 <p>He who knows his innocence and recognizes his sin becomes the world's model. Being a world's model, infinite teh will not fail, he will return to the Absolute.</p>  
 <p>He who knows the glory of his nature and recognizes also his limitations becomes useful like the world's valleys. Being like the world's <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a> valleys, eternal teh will not fail him, he will revert to simplicity.</p>  
 <p>Radiating simplicity he will make of men vessels of usefulness. The wise man then will employ them as officials and chiefs. A great administration of such will harm no one.</p>
