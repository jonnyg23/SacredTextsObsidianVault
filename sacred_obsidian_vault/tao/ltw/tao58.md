 <p>When an administration is unostentatious the people are simple. When an administration is <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> inquisitive, the people are needy. Misery, alas, supports happiness. Happiness, alas, conceals misery. Who knows its limits? It never ceases. The normal becomes the abnormal. The good in turn becomes unlucky. The people's confusion is felt daily for a long time.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the wise man is square, yet does not injure, he is angular but does not annoy. He is upright but is not cross. He is bright but not glaring.</p>
