 <p>In the world nothing is more fragile than water, and yet of all the agencies that attack hard substances nothing can surpass it.</p>  
 <p>Of all things there is nothing that can take the <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a> place of Tao. By it the weak are conquerors of the strong, the pliable are conquerors of the rigid. In the world every one knows this, but none practice it.</p>
