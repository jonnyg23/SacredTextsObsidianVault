 <p>Tao gives life to all creatures; teh feeds them; materiality shapes them; energy completes them. <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a> Therefore among all things there is none that does not honor Tao and esteem teh. Honor for Tao and esteem for teh is never compelled, it is always spontaneous. Therefore Tao gives life to them, but teh nurses them, raises them, nurtures, completes, matures, rears, protects them.</p>  
 <p>Tao gives life to them but makes no claim of ownership; teh forms them but makes no claim upon them, raises them but does not rule them. This is profound vitality (teh).</p>
