 <p>58. 1. The government that seems the most unwise,<br>
 Oft goodness to the people best supplies;</p></dir>

 <p>That which is meddling, touching everything,<br>
 Will work but ill, and disappointment bring.</p></dir>

 <img src="img/10200.jpg">, 'Transformation according to Circumstances;' but this title does not throw light on the meaning of the chapter; nor are we helped to an understanding of it by Han Fei, with his additions and comments (XI, 3 b, 4 b), nor by Hwâi-nan with his illustrations (XII, 21 a, b). The difficulty of it is increased by its being separated from the preceding chapter of which it is really the sequel. It contrasts still further government by the Tâo, with that by the method of correction. The sage is the same in both chapters, his character and government both marked by the opposites or contraries which distinguish the procedure of the Tâo, as stated in ch. 40.</p>
