 <p>61. 1. What makes a great state is its being (like) low-lying, down-flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven.</p>
 <p>2. (To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement.</p>

 <p>3. Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.</p>
 <p>4. The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself</p>
