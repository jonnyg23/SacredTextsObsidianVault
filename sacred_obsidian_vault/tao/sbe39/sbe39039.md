 <h3 align="CENTER">32.</h3>
 <p>32. 1. The Tâo, considered as unchanging, has no name.</p>
 <p>2. Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him.</p>
 <p>3. Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without</p>
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>
 <p>the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord.</p>
 <p>4. As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.</p>
 <p>5. The relation of the Tâo to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys.</p>

 <img src="img/07500.jpg">, Chalmers translates this by "sagely virtue.' But I cannot adopt that rendering, and find it difficult to supply a better. The 'virtue' is evidently the Attribute of the Tâo come out from the condition of the Absolute, and capable of being named. In the former state it has no name; in the latter, it has. Par. 1 and the commencement of par. 4 must both be explained from ch. 1.</p>
 <p>The 'primordial simplicity' in par. 2 is the Tâo in its simplest conception, alone, and by itself, and the <a name="img_07501"></a>
 <img src="img/07501.jpg"> in par. 4 is that Tâo come forth into operation and become Teh, the Teh which affords a law for men. From this to the end of the paragraph is very obscure. I have translated from the text of Wang Pî. The text of Ho-shang Kung is different, and he comments upon it as it stands, but to me it is inexplicable.</p>
