 <h3 align="CENTER">81.</h3>
 <p>81. 1. Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tâo) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tâo) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.</p>
 <p>2. The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself.</p>
 <p>3. With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.</p>

 <img src="img/12301.jpg">, 'The Manifestation of Simplicity.' The chapter shows how quietly and effectively the Tâo proceeds, and by contraries in a way that only the master of it can understand. The author, says Wû Khäng, 'sums up in this the subject-matter of the two Parts of his Treatise, showing that in all its five thousand characters, there is nothing beyond what is here said.'</p>

 <p>Par. 2 suggests to Dr. Chalmers the well-known lines of Bunyan as an analogue of it:--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>'A man there was, though some did count him mad,<br>
 The more he gave away, the more he had.'</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Wû Khäng brings together two sentences from Kwang-dze (XXXIII, 21 b, 22 a), written evidently with the characters of this text in mind, which, as from a Tâoist mint, are a still better analogue, and I venture to put them into rhyme:--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Amassing but to him a sense of need betrays;<br>
 He hoards not, and thereby his affluence displays.'</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I have paused long over the first pair of contraries in par. 3 (<a name="img_12400"></a>
 <img src="img/12400.jpg"> and <a name="img_12401"></a>
 <img src="img/12401.jpg">). Those two characters primarily mean 'sharpness' and 'wounding by cutting;' they are also often used in the sense of I being beneficial,' and 'being injurious;'--'contraries,' both of them. Which 'contrary' had Lâo-dze in mind? I must think the former, though differing in this from all previous translators. The Jesuit version is, 'Celestis Tâo natura ditat omnes, nemini nocet;' Julien's, 'Il est utile aux êtres, et ne leur nuit point;' Chalmers's, 'Benefits and does not injure;' and V. von Strauss's, 'Des Himmels Weise ist wolthun und nicht beschddigen.'</p>
