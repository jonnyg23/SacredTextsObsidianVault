 <p>68. He who in (Tâo's) wars has skill<br>
     Assumes no martial port;<br>
 He who fights with most good will<br>
     To rage makes no resort.<br>
 He who vanquishes yet still<br>
     Keeps from his foes apart;<br>
 He whose hests men most fulfil<br>
     Yet humbly plies his art.<br>
 Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,<br>
     And therein is his might.'<br>
 Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,<br>
     That they with him unite.'<br>
 Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,<br>
     No sage of old more bright.'</p></dir>
