 <h3 align="CENTER">76.</h3>
 <p>76. 1. Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.</p>
 <p>2. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.</p>
 <p>3. Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.)</p>
 <p>4. Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> '(so it is with) all things' are found in the texts of both Ho-shang Kung and Wang Pî, but Wû Khäng and Ziâo Hung both reject them. I should also have neglected them, but they are also found in Liû Hsiang's Shwo Wän (X, 4 a), with all the rest of pars. 1 and 2, as from Lâo-dze. They are an anakoluthon, such as is elsewhere found in our King; e.g. <a name="img_11900"></a>
 <img src="img/11900.jpg"> in ch. 21, par. 2.</p>
 <p>The 'above' and 'below' in par. 4 seem to be merely a play on the words, as capable of meaning 'more and less honourable.'</p>
