 <h3 align="CENTER">51.</h3>
 <p>51. 1. All things are produced by the Tâo, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are</p>
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a></p>
 <p>completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tâo, and exalt its outflowing operation.</p>
 <p>2. This honouring of the Tâo and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.</p>
 <p>3. Thus it is that the Tâo produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them.</p>
 <p>4. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;-this is called its mysterious operation.</p>

 <img src="img/09400.jpg">, 'The Operation (of the Tâo) in Nourishing Things.' The subject of the chapter is the quiet passionless operation of the Tâo in nature, in the production and nourishing of things throughout the seasons of the year; a theme dwelt on by Lâo-dze, in II, 4, X, 3, and other places.</p>
 <p>The Tâo is the subject of all the predicates in par. 1, and what seem the subjects in all but the first member should be construed adverbially.</p>
 <p>On par. 2 Wû Khäng says that the honour of the Son of Heaven is derived from his appointment by God, and that then the nobility of the feudal princes is derived from him; but in the honour given to the Tâo and the nobility ascribed to its operation, we are not to think of any external ordination. There is a strange reading of two of the members of par. 3 in Wang Pî, viz. <a name="img_09401"></a>
 <img src="img/09401.jpg"> for <a name="img_09402"></a>
 <img src="img/09402.jpg">. This is quoted and predicated of 'Heaven,' in the Nestorian Monument of Hsî-an in the eighth century.</p>
