 <h2 align="center">CHAPTER XIV<br> <small>DIFFICULTY AND EASE OF GOVERNMENT</small></h2>
 
 <p>Y<small>ANG</small> C<small>HU</small> had an audience with the King of Leang.</p>
 
 <p>   Yang Chu said: "To govern the world is as easy as to turn round the palm of the hand."</p>
 
 <p>   The King of Leang said:</p>
 
 <p>   "You have a wife and a concubine, Master, but are unable to govern them. You have a garden of three acres, but are unable to weed it. How then can you say that governing the world is like turning round the palm of the hand?"</p>
 
 <p>   Yang Chu said:</p>
 
 <p>   "Observe, your Majesty, the shepherds. One allows a boy only five feet high to shoulder a whip and drive a hundred sheep. He wants them to go eastward, and they obey him, or westward, and they obey him. Now let Yao drag a sheep, and Shen follow with a whip, and they will never advance a yard. Fishes that swallow ships do not enter into small rivers.</p>
 
 <p>   "Wild geese that soar on high do not light on low marshes, but are borne over in their flights. The notes C and Cis do not harmonise with brisk and lively airs, for the sound is too different. Thus a man who manages important matters does not trouble himself about trifles. And he who accomplishes great deeds does no small ones. That was my meaning."</p>
