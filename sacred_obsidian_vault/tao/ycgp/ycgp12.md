 <p>Y<small>ANG</small> C<small>HU</small> said:</p>
 
 <p>   "Po-chêng-tse-kao<a name="page_52_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_52_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> would not part with a hair of his body for the benefit of others. He quitted

 his country and became a ploughman. The great Yü<a name="page_53_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_53_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> did not profit by his own body, which grew quite emaciated.</p>
 
 <p>   "If the ancients by injuring a single hair could have rendered a service to the world, they would not have done it; and had the universe been offered to a single person, he would not have accepted it.</p>
 
 <p>   "As nobody would damage even a hair, and nobody would do a favour to the world, the world was in a perfect state."</p>
 
 <p>   Ch’in-Tse asked Yang Chu:</p>
 
 <p>   "If by pulling out a hair of your body you would aid mankind, would you do it?"</p>
 
 <p>   Yang Chu answered:</p>
 
 <p>   "Mankind is surely not to be helped by a single hair."</p>
 
 <p>   Ch’in-Tse said:</p>
 
 <p>   "But supposing it possible, would you do it?"</p>
 
 <p>   Yang Chu gave no answer.</p>
 
 <p>   Thereupon Ch’in-Tse told Meng-sun-Yang, who replied:</p>
 
 <p>   "I will explain the Master's meaning.</p>
 
 <p>   "Supposing for tearing off a piece of your skin you were offered ten thousand gold pieces, would you do it?"</p>
 
 <p>   Ch’in-Tse said:</p>
 
 <p>   "I would."</p>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 <p>   Meng-sun-Yang again asked:</p>
 
 <p>   "Supposing for cutting off one of your limbs you were to get a kingdom, would you do it?"</p>
 
 <p>   Ch’in-Tse was silent.</p>
 
 <p>   "See now," said Meng-sun-Yang. "A hair is unimportant compared with the skin, and the skin also is unimportant compared with a limb.</p>
 
 <p>   "However, many hairs put together form skin, and many skins form a limb. Therefore, though a hair is but one among the many molecules composing the body, it is not to be disregarded."</p>
 
 <p>   Ch’in-Tse replied:</p>
 
 <p>   "I do not know how to answer you. If I were to ask Lao-tse and Kuan-Yin,<a name="page_54_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_54_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> your opinion would be found right, and so also if I were to consult great Yü and Me-ti."</p>
 
 <p>   Meng-sun-Yang upon this turned round to his disciples, and spoke of something else.</p>
