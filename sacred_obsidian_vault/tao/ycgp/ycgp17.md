 <h2 align="center">CHAPTER XVII<br> <small>THE FOUR CHIMERAS</small></h2>
 
 <p>Y<small>ANG</small> C<small>HU</small> said:</p>
 
 <p>   "There are four things which do not allow people to rest:</p>
 
 <p>   "Long life. Reputation. Rank. Riches.</p>
 
 <p>   "Those who have them fear ghosts, fear men, power, and punishment. They are always fugitives. Whether they are killed or live they regulate their lives by externals.</p>
 
 <p>   "Those who do not set their destiny at defiance do not desire a long life, and those who are not fond of honour do not desire reputation.</p>
 
 <p>   "Those who do not want power desire no rank.</p>
 
 <p>   "Those who are not avaricious have no desire for riches.</p>
 
 <p>   "Of this sort of men it may be truthfully said

 that they live in accordance with their nature. In the whole world they have no equal.</p>
 
 <p>   "They regulate their life by inward things.</p>
 
 <p>   "There is an old proverb which says:</p>
 
 <p>   "Without marriage and an official career a man would be free from half of his yearnings.</p>
 
 <p>   "If men could do without clothes and food there would be no more kings or subjects."</p>
