 <p>ALAS! the barrenness of the age has not yet reached its limit. All men are radiant with happiness, as if enjoying a great feast, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone am still, and give as yet no sign of joy. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled, forlorn as one who has nowhere to lay his head. Other men have plenty, while I alone seem to have lost all. I am a man foolish in heart, dull and confused. Other men are full of light; I alone seem to be in darkness. Other men are alert; I alone am listless. I am unsettled as the ocean, drifting as though I had no stopping-place. All men have their usefulness; I alone am stupid and clownish. Lonely though I am and unlike other men, yet I revere the Foster-Mother, Tao.</p>  
 <p>My words are very easy to understand, very easy to put into practice; yet the world can neither understand nor practise them.</p>  
 <p>My words have a clue, my actions have an underlying principle. It is because men do not know the clue that they understand me not.</p>  
 <p>Those who know me are but few, and on that account my honour is the greater.</p>  
 <p>Thus the Sage wears coarse garments, but carries a jewel in his bosom.</p>
