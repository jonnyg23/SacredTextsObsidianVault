 <p>1. "What is well planted is not uprooted;<br>
 What's well preserved can not be looted!"</p></dir>

 <p>2. By sons and grandsons the sacrificial celebrations shall not cease.</p>
 <p>3. Who cultivates Reason in his person, his virtue is genuine.</p>
 <p>Who cultivates it in his house, his virtue is overflowing.</p>
 <p>Who cultivates it in his township, his virtue is lasting.</p>
 <p>Who cultivates it in his country, his virtue is abundant.</p>
 <p>Who cultivates it in the world, his virtue is universal.</p>
 <p>4. Therefore,</p>
 <p>By one's person one tests persons.</p>
 <p>By one's house one tests houses.</p>
 <p>By one's township one tests townships.</p>
 <p>By one's country one tests countries.</p>
 <p>By one's world one tests worlds.</p>
 <p>5. How do I know that the world is such? Through IT.</p>
