 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER 39.</h3>
 <p>Plato scholars will note that the famous dialogue "Parmenides," discussing the problem of the one and the many, may fitly be compared with Lao-tze's exposition of the nature of oneness, the poetical portion of which sounds like a philosophical rhapsody.</p>
 <p>The simile that the carriage does not consist of its parts, but it a definite combination of its parts, is also used in the Buddhist book, "Questions of King Milinda," written several centuries after Lao-tze.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">*   *   *</p>
 <p>The last line in section 7, <i>Ta fang wu yü</i> (literally, "Greatest square has no corner") should be compared with the same sentiment in Chapter 45, <i>ta chih joh chü</i> ("greatest straightness seems curved").</p>
