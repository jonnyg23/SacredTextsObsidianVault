 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER 18.</h3>
 <p>This chapter is directed against the Confucianist morality of filial piety, loyalty, and justice. Lao-tze is disgusted with the very words. Where the Tao obtains there is no need of preaching justice, filial piety and loyalty, for the <a href="errata.htm#2">virtue</a> of the Tao is spontaneous. The men whose hearts are bare of these virtues, parade them in words.</p>
