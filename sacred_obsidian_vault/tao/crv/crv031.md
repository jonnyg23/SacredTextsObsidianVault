 <h3 align="CENTER">25. IMAGING THE MYSTERIOUS.</h3>
 <p><a name="img_tao25"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao25.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. There is a Being wondrous and complete. Before heaven and earth, it was. How calm it is! How spiritual!
 <p>2. Alone it standeth, and it changeth not; around it moveth, and it suffereth not; yet therefore can it be the world's mother.</p>
 <p>3. Its name I know not, but its nature I call Reason.</p>
 <p>4. Constrained to give a name, I call it the great. The great I call the departing, and the departing I call the beyond. The beyond I call home.</p>
 <p>5. The saying goes: "Reason is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and royalty also is great. [There are four things <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a> in the world that are great, and royalty is one of them.]</p>
 <p>6. Man's standard is the earth. The earth's standard is heaven. Heaven's standard is Reason. Reason's standard is intrinsic.</p>
