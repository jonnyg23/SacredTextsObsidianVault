 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao62.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. The man of Reason is the ten thousand creatures' refuge, the good man's wealth, the bad man's stay.
 <p>2. With beautiful words one can sell. With honest conduct one can do still more with the people.</p>
 <p>3. If a man be bad, why should he be thrown away? Therefore, an emperor was elected and three ministers appointed; but better than holding before one's face the jade table [of the ministry] and riding with four horses, is sitting still and propounding the eternal Reason.</p>
 <p>4. Why do the ancients prize this Reason? Is it not, say, because when sought <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> it is obtained and the sinner thereby can be saved? Therefore it is world-honored.</p>
