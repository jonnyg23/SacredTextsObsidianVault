 <h3 align="CENTER">67. THE THREE TREASURES.</h3>
 <p><a name="img_tao67"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao67.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. All in the world call me great; but I resemble the unlikely. Now a man is great only because he resembles the unlikely. Did he resemble the likely, how lasting, indeed, would his mediocrity be!
 <p>2. 1 have three treasures which I <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> cherish and prize. The first is called compassion. The second is called economy. The third is called not daring to come to the front in the world.</p>
 <p>3. The compassionate can be brave; the economical can be generous; those who dare not come to the front in the world can become perfect as chief vessels.</p>
 <p>4. Now, if people discard compassion and are brave; if they discard economy and are generous; if they discard modesty and are ambitious, they will surely die.</p>
 <p>5. Now, the compassionate will in attack be victorious, and in defence firm. Heaven when about to save one will with compassion protect him.</p>
