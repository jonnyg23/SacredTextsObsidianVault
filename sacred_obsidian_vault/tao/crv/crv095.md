 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER 10.</h3>
 <p>The text of the first two sentences is difficult, and we deem our present version an improvement. <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">7</font></a> Literally the beginning seems to read thus: "Being insistent in disciplining the sense soul." Mr. Ng Poon Chew writes: "The first two characters are verbs, there is no question as to that. The word <i>poh</i> is commonly understood by the Chinese to be the passive half of the human soul equivalent to <i>yin</i> in nature."</p>
 <p>The Manchu version (as Dr. Laufer informs me) in agreement with a Chinese quotation of this passage by Huai Nan Tze takes all these sentences as queries.</p>
