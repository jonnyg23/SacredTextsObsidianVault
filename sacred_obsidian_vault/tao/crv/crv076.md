 <p><a name="img_tao70"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao70.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them.
 <p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 124</font></a></p>
 <p>2. Words have an ancestor; Deeds have a master [viz., Reason]. Since he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished.</p>
 <p>3. Therefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his jewels.</p>
