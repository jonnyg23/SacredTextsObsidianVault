 <p>2. When an average scholar hears of Reason he will sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it.</p>
 <p>3. When an inferior scholar hears of Reason he will greatly ridicule it. Were it not thus ridiculed, it would as Reason be insufficient.</p>
 <p>4. Therefore the poet says:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>5. "The Reason--enlightened seem dark and black, <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a><br>
 The Reason--advanced seem going back,<br>
 The Reason--straight-levelled seem rugged and slack.</p>
 <p>6. "The high in virtue resemble a vale,<br>
 The purely white in shame must quail,<br>
 The staunchest virtue seems to fail.</p>
 <p>7. "The solidest virtue seems not alert,<br>
 The purest chastity seems pervert,<br>
 The greatest square will rightness desert.</p>
 <p>8. "The largest vessel is not yet complete,<br>
 The loudest sound is not speech replete,<br>
 The greatest form has no shape concrete."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>9. Reason so long as it remains latent is unnamable. Yet Reason alone is good for imparting and completing.</p>
