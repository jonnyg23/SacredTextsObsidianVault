 <p>1. "Who his manhood shows<br>
 And his womanhood knows<br>
 Becomes the empire's river.<br>
 Is he the empire's river,<br>
 He will from virtue never deviate,<br>
 And home he turneth to a child's estate. <a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p>
 <p>2. "Who his brightness shows<br>
 And his blackness knows<br>
 Becomes the empire's model.<br>
 Is he the empire's model,<br>
 Of virtue ne'er shall he be destitute,<br>
 And home he turneth to the absolute.</p>
 <p>3. "Who knows his fame<br>
 And guards his shame<br>
 Becomes the empire's valley.<br>
 Is he the empire's valley,<br>
 For e'er his virtue will sufficient be,<br>
 And home he turneth to simplicity."</p></dir>

 <p>4. Simplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm.</p>
