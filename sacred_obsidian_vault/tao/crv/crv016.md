Who by unending discipline of the senses embraces unity cannot be disintegrated. <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> By concentrating his vitality and inducing tenderness he can become like a little child. By purifying, by cleansing and profound intuition he can be free from faults.
 <p>2. Who loves the people when administering the country will practise nonassertion.</p>
 <p>Opening and closing the gates of heaven, he will be like a mother-bird; bright, and white, and penetrating the four quarters, he will be unsophisticated. He quickens them and feeds them. He quickens but owns not. He acts but claims not. He excels but rules not. This is called profound virtue.</p>
