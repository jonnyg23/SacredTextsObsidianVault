 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao77.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. Is not Heaven's Reason truly like stretching a bow? The high it brings down, the lowly it lifts up. Those who have abundance it depleteth; those who are deficient it augmenteth.
 <p>2. Such is Heaven's Reason. It depleteth those who have abundance but completeth the deficient.</p>
 <p>3. Man's Reason is not so. He depleteth the deficient in order to serve those who have abundance.</p>

 <p>4. Where is he who would have abundance for serving the world?</p>
 <p>5. Indeed, it is the holy man who acts but claims not; merit he acquires but he does not dwell upon it, and does he ever show any anxiety to display his excellence?</p>
