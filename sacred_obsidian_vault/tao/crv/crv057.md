The forces complete them. Therefore <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a> among the ten thousand things there is none that does not esteem Reason and honor virtue.
 <p>2. Since the esteem of Reason and the honoring of virtue is by no one commanded, it is forever spontaneous.</p>
 <p>3. Therefore it is said that Reason quickens all creatures, while virtue feeds them, raises them, nurtures them, completes them, matures them, rears them, and protects them.</p>
 <p>4. To quicken but not to own, to make but not to claim, to raise but not to rule, this is called profound virtue.</p>
