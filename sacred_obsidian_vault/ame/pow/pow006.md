 </i><p>A remedy to be used when anyone is falling away, and which has cured many persons.--Let the person in perfect soberness and without having conversed with anyone, catch rain in a pot, before sunrise; boil on egg in this; bore three small holes in this egg with a needle, and carry it to an ant-hill made by big ants; and that person will feel relieved as soon as the egg is devoured.</p>
