 <p align="CENTER">TO PREVENT WITCHES FROM BEWITCHING CATTLE, TO BE WRITTEN AND PLACED IN THE STABLE; AND AGAINST BAD MEN AND EVIL SPIRITS WHICH NIGHTLY TORMENT OLD AND YOUNG PEOPLE, TO BE WRITTEN AND PLACED ON THE BEDSTEAD.</p> 
 <p>"Trotter Head, I forbid thee my house and premises; I forbid thee my horse and cow-stable; I forbid thee my bedstead, that thou mayest not breathe upon me; breathe into some other house, until thou hast ascended every hill, until thou hast counted every fence-post, and until thou hast crossed every water. And thus dear day may come again into my house, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen."</p> 
 <p>This will certainly protect and free all persons and animals from witchcraft.</p>
