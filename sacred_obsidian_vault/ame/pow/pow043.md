 <p align="CENTER">A REMARKABLE PASSAGE FROM THE BOOK OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.</p> 
 <p>It says: If you burn a large frog to ashes, and mix the ashes with water, you will obtain an ointment that will, if put on any place covered with hair, destroy the hair and prevent it from growing again.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">ANOTHER PASSAGE FROM THE WORK OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.</p> 
 <p>If you find the stone which a vulture has in his knees, and which you may find by looking sharp, and put it in the victuals of two persons who hate each other, it causes them to make up and be good friends.</p>
