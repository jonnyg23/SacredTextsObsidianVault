 <p align="CENTER">PHYSIC BALL FOR HORSES.</p> 
 <p>Cape aloes, from six to ten drachms; Castile soap, one drachm; spirits of wine, one drachm; syrup to form the ball. If mercurial physic be wanted, add from one-half a drachm to one drachm of calomel.</p> 
 <p>Previous to physicking a horse, and during its operation, he should be fed on bran mashes, allowed plenty of chilled water, and have exercise. Physic is always useful; it is necessary to be administered in almost every disease; it improves digestion, and gives strength to the lacteals by cleansing the intestines and unloading the liver; and if the animal is afterward properly fed, will improve his strength and condition in a remarkable degree. <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></a> Physic, except in urgent cases, should he given in the morning and on an empty stomach, and, if required to be repeated, a week should intervene between each dose.</p> 
 <p>Before giving a horse a ball, see that it is not too hard nor too large. Cattle medicine is always given as a drench.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">PHYSIC FOR CATTLE.</p> 
 <p>Cape aloes, four drachms to one oz.; Epsom salts, four to six oz.; powdered ginger, three drachms. Mix and give in a quart of gruel. For calves, one-third of this will be a dose.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">SEDATIVE AND WORM BALL.</p> 
 <p>Powdered white hellebore, one-half drachm; linseed powder, one-half oz. If necessary, make into a ball with molasses. This ball is a specific for weed. Two ounces of gargling oil, in one-half bottle of linseed oil, is an effectual remedy for worms in horses and cattle.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">ASTRINGENT BALL FOR LOOSENESS IN HORSES.</p> 
 <p>Opium from one-half to one drachm; ginger, one and a half drachms; prepared chalk, three drachms; flour, two drachms. Powder, and make into a ball with molasses.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">MIXTURE FOR ULCERS AND ALL FOUL SORES.</p> 
 <p>Sulphate of zinc, one oz.; corrosive sublimate, one drachm; spirit of salt, four drachms; water, one pint; mix.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">YELLOW WATER IN HORSES.</p> 
 <p>Take Venetian soap, juniper oil, saltpetre, sal prunella, sweet spirits of nitre, of each one ounce; make it into a ball with pulverized licorice root, and give the horse two ounces at once, and repeat if necessary. If attended with a violent fever, bleed, and give bran mashes; or,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></a></p> 
 <p>Take a. gallon of strong beer, or ale, add thereto two ounces of Castile soap and one ounce of saltpetre; stir, and mix daily of this with his feed.</p> 
 <p>The following is also highly recommended in a German work:</p> 
 <p>Take pulverized gentian and calamus, of each one-half ounce; sulphate of potassa, two ounces; tartar emetic, liver of sulphur, and oil of turpentine, one-eighth of an ounce each; mix it with flour and water, and give the above in the incipient stage of the disease.</p> 
 <p>The dose, if necessary, may be given daily for several days.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">A VALUABLE RECIPE FOR GALLS--WINDGALLS IN HORSES.</p> 
 <p>An intelligent and experienced farmer, rising of seventy years of age, residing in Allen township, Cumberland county, has assured us that the following ointment, if applied two or three times a day, will cure the most obstinate windgalls.</p> 
 <p>Take one pound of the leaves of stramonium (Jamestown weed) bruised; two pounds of fresh butter or hog's lard, and one gill of the spirits of turpentine; put the whole of the ingredients into a clean earthen crock and place it with the contents over live coals for twenty or thirty minutes, stirring it occasionally: then strain it through a coarse cloth or canvas, and it forms a consistent ointment, with which anoint the windgalls two or three times a day.</p> 
 <p>Fifty dollars had been offered for the above receipt, so says our informant, who kindly furnished it.</p> 
 <p align="CENTER">WIND-BROKEN HORSES.</p> 
 <p>The excellent ball for broken-winded horses, that has made a perfect cure of over seven hundred in less than nine months, after many other medicines being tried, in vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></a></p> 
 <p>Take myrrh, elecampane, and licorice root, in fine powder, three ounces each; saffron, three drachms: assaftida, one ounce; sulphur squills and cinnabar of antimony, of each two ounces; aurum mosaicum, one ounce and a half; oil of aniseed, eighty drops. You may make it into paste with either treacle or honey, and give the horse the quantity of a hen's egg every morning for a week; and afterwards every other morning till the disorder is removed.--[<i>Montague's Farrier</i>, page 57.]</p>
