 <p align="CENTER">FOR THE STING OF A WASP OR BEE.</p> 
 <p>A Liverpool paper states as follows: "A few days ago, happening to be in the country, we witnessed the efficacy of the remedy for the sting of a wasp mentioned in one of our late papers. A little boy was stung severely and was in great torture, until an onion was applied to the part affected, when the cure was instantaneous. This important and simple remedy cannot be too generally known, and we pledge ourselves to the facts above stated."</p>
