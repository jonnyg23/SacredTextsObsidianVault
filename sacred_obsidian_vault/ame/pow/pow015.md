Son. and Holy Ghost), at the same time facing toward sunrise. Whenever you apply this wand in searching for anything apply it three times.

 <p>the thickest end, and that which you desire will appear immediately, if there is any in the ground where you strike. The words to be spoken when the wand is thus applied are as follows:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>Archangel Gabriel, I conjure thee in the name of God, the Almighty, to tell me, is there any water here or not? do tell me! + + +</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>If you are searching for Iron or Ore, you have to say the same, only mention the name of what you are searching for.</p>
