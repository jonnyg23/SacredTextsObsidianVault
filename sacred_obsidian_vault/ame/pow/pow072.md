 <p align="CENTER">TO CURE THE SWEENEY IN HORSES.</p> 
 <p>Take a piece of old bacon, and cut it into small pieces, put them in a pan and roast them well, put in a handful of fish-worms, a gill of oats and three spoonfuls of salt into it; roast the whole of this until it turns black, and then filter it through a cloth; after which you put a gill of soft soap, half a gill of rye whiskey, half a gill of vinegar, and half a pint of rain-water to it; mix it well, and smear it over the part affected with sweeny on the third, the sixth, and the ninth day of the new moon, and warm it with an oaken board.</p>
