 <p align="CENTER">STINGING NETTLES---GOOD FOR BANISHING FEARS AND FANCIES, AND TO CAUSE FISH TO COLLECT.</p> 
 <p>Whenever you hold this weed in your hand together with Millifolia, you are safe from all fears and fancies that frequently deceive men. If you mix it with a decoction of the hemlock, and rub your hands with it, and put the rest in water that contains fish, you will find the fish to collect around your hands. Whenever you pull your hands out of the water, the fish disappear by returning to their former places.</p>
