 Montague Summers (1880-1948)
 was suposedly a member of the Roman Catholic clergy. 
 There is a 25 year gap in his biography during which it is speculated
 he dabbled in the dark arts.
 Summers wrote numerous serious books about
 the witch hunts, vampires, werewolves,
 and other occult subjects.
 He violently disagreed with
 <a href="../../pag/murray.htm">Margaret Murray</a>,
 and advocated the death penalty for witches!
 <p>
 In this work Summers discusses the vampire phenomena from a
 relentless Catholic perspective; he either belives in the
 literal reality of vampires, or is pulling our leg.
 However, this is not a hoax.
 This book has all of the apparatus to qualify as an
 academic study, including footnotes, extensive quotations in the
 original languages, and references to rare source documents.
 Of particular interest is the final chapter, which traces the development
 of the vampire craze in 19th century literature.</p>

 A reader has contributed the following information, which 
 clears up some of the murk about Summer's academic career
 and clerical background (and also supplies a middle name which is not
 found anywhere in his bibliography):</p>

 There is an entry for Summers in 
 Crockford's Clerical Dictionary, 1909, p. 1394, col. b:</p>

 "He was ordained as an Anglican (Church of England) priest:
 I was unable to find any mention of him in the Catholic Directory
 so [I] 'deduce' that he was high church and left to become
 a Roman though whether his priesthood went with him, or not, I do not know."
