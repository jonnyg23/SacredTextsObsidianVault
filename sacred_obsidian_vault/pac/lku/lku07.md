 <p>A sacred emblem <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> is the kahili of Kuakamano<br> That sends out its stiff branches as a sacred frill,<br> Which fills the faint-hearted with awe,<br> But brings such ones to claim friendship. <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a><br> Those are beings who eat by gushing waters,<br> Who eat also by the dashing sea,<br> They live in nests inside ditches,<br> There in hollow places the parent rats dwell,<br> There huddle together the little mice.<br> It is they who keep the changes of the month.</p>  
 <p>The mites of the land,<br> The mites of the water,<br> ’Tis Mehe the reddish seaweed<br> Whose lashes stand,<br> That hides and peeps.<br> There are rats inland, there are rats at sea.<br> There are also rabbits<br> That were born in the night of the crash--<br> They were born in the night that moved away.<br> The tiniest mice move by crawling;<br> The tiny mice spring as they move.<br> They run over the pebbles,<br> The propagating pebbles where no inland ohia bear.<br> A puny child born in the night of the crash.<br> They gave birth to beings that leaped in the night, that moved away<br> The child of Uli-a-kama last night.<br>                           ’Tis night.</p>
