 The Trobriand Islanders of the Melanesian region,
 as well as many other cultures in the
 Australian and New Guinea regions, had a belief that there was
 no cause and effect relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy.
 As detailed in this monograph, the Trobrianders belived that
 the Baloma, the spirits of the dead, would return from the afterlife
 and impregnate women when they bathed in the lagoon, thus reincarnating
 the dead ancestor.</p>
 <p>
 This often cited monograph by one of the founders of modern ethnography is
 a classic of the field.
 Malinowski makes a breakthrough observation
 this is not just a quaint lack of scientific understanding by 'natives';
 it is part of an entire cultural complex
 that makes as much sense as any other, relatively speaking. 
 He makes the point that no set of beliefs can be studied in
 isolation from the rest of society.  
 Anthropology should not be the haphazard collection of random customs and
 artifacts, as it had been up to that point.
 Rather, we need to study cultures on their own terms in a systematic fashion.</p>
