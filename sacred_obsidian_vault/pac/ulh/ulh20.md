 <p>The hula <i>íli-íli</i>, pebble-dance, was a performance of the classical times, in which, according to one who has witnessed it, the olapa alone took part. The dancers held in each hand a couple of pebbles, <i>ili-ili</i>, hence the name of the dance--which they managed to clash against each other, after the fashion of castanets, thus producing a rude music of much the same quality as that elicited from the "bones" in our minstrel performances. According to another witness, the drum also was sometimes used in connection with the pebbles as an accompaniment to this hula.</p>  
 <p>The ili-ili was at times a hula of intensity--that is to say, was acted with that stress of voice and manner which the Hawaiians termed <i>ai-ha’a</i>; but it seems to have been more often performed in that quiet natural tone of voice and of manner termed <i>ko’i-honua</i>, which may be likened to utterance in low relief.</p>  
 <p>The author can present only the fragment of a song to illustrate this hula:</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Mele</i></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">A lalo maua o Wai-pi’o,<br> Ike i ka nani o Hi’i-lawe.<br> E lawe mai a oki<br> I na hala o Naue i ke kai,<br> 5 I na lehua lu-lu’u pali;<br> Noho ana lohe i ke kani o ka o-ó,<br> Hoolono aku i ka leo o ke kahuli.</div>

 <p><i>Wai-pi’o</i>, the scene of this idyl, is a valley deep and broad which the elements have scooped out in the windward exposure of Hawaii, and scarce needs mention to Hawaiian tourists. <i>Hi’i-lawe</i> is one of</p>

 <p><i>Kahuli</i> is a fanciful name applied to the beautiful and unique genus of tree-shells (Achatinella), <a href="#img_pl12">plate XII</a>, that inhabit the Hawaiian woods. The natives are persuaded that these shells have the power of chirping a song of their own, and the writer has often heard the note which they ascribe to them; but to his ear it was indistinguishable from the piping of the cricket. This is the song that the natives credit to the tree-shells:</p>

 <p>This little piece of rustic imagination is said to have been used in the hula, but in connection with what dance the author has not been able to learn.</p>
