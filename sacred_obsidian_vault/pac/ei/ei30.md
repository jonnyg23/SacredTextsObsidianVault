 <p>Hundreds of tombs, cairns, platforms, and catacombs were examined during our stay on the island, and in all cases the bodies were lying at full length. In a vault beneath platform No. 11 are a number of skulls packed together in sufficient quantity to completely fill the compartment--trophies of war perhaps, in view of the fact that the skulls were those of adults; but in no single instance did we discover the remains doubled up as the Incas and other American aborigines were in the habit of burying their dead.
