 This is one of the only public domain sources of information on the religious
 beliefs of the Yezidi, a small group originally from
 the northern region of Iraq.
 Although they speak Kurdish, they are a distinct population from the Kurds.
 The Yezidi are notable because they have been described as
 devil-worshippers, which has, unfortunately, led to constant persecution
 by the dominant Islamic culture of the region.
 Yezidi religious beliefs upon closer examination
 appear to be a mixture of Gnostic cosmology with Muslim,
 Christian and other influences.
 They have many unique beliefs, such as that the first Yezidi were created by
 Adam by parthenogenesis separately from Eve.
 They believe that there was a flood before the flood of Noah.
 They also have a set of food taboos which include meat, fish, squash, okra, beans, cabbage and lettuce.
 </p>
 <p>
 Do they really worship the devil?
 In fact, you could just as well say that they worship angels, and this
 might be the best way to spin this
 for people who aren't interested in theological nuances,
 or have no experience with such a radically
 'different' belief system.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joseph says:
 (<a href="sby24.htm#page_155">p. 155</a>) "<i>It is interesting to note that,
 in the history of religion, the god of one people is the devil of another</i>."
 Their cosmology is so radically different from the dominant paradigm that
 it is hard to translate the concepts.
 The Yezidis believe in a single creator,
 who created a set of other deities which could be just as well be
 called demons, angels, or gods.
 The primary one of these, and the one that the Yezidi
 worship, is called Melek Ta`us, who is represented as a peacock.
 One scholar (whom Joseph disagrees with) traces this name to that of
 Tammuz, the ancient Syrian deity.
 Joseph, however, claims:
 (<a href="sby24.htm#page_148">p. 148</a>)
 "<i>[Melek Ta`us] denotes the devil and nothing else.
 This is so clear to the Yezidis, or to anyone acquainted
 with their religion, as to leave no need for further discussion</i>".
 </p>
 <p>
 In some polytheistic religions good and evil deities are worshipped
 equally; the good gods so that good things will happen, and the evil ones
 also are propitiated so that bad things won't happen.
 The Yezidi theology differs in that God is so good that he has no
 need of worship; Melek Ta`us is sort of a firewall between this imperfect world
 and the perfection of the supreme being.
 This is similar to beliefs of some ancient
 <a href="../../gno/index.htm">Gnostics</a> that God, being purely good,
 had to create a set of intermediaries, the Aeons.
 This is so that the Aeons, in turn, could create a world which includes <a href="../../evil/index.htm">evil</a>.
 It should be kept in mind that, when this book was written,
 the Gnostics were virtually unknown,
 save from opposing views in early Christian writings.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Yezidi have a strong ethical code and customs like those of many
 other agricultural tribal people, as is apparent from the ethnological
 sketch which rounds out this book.
 In spite of this, authors from <a href="../../evil/hod/index.htm">Paul Carus</a>
 to H.P. Lovecraft have painted the Yezidi as sinister worshippers
 of the evil one.
 Some of the poetry from this book was borrowed in the 1960s
 by the Satanist Anton LaVey for his liturgy. 
 This image is simply not borne out by a close reading.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Yezidi are important to the study of religions in a way that the
 <a href="../../neu/basque/index.htm">Basque</a>
 are important to the study of languages.
 Like the <a href="../../jud/sam/index.htm">Samaritans</a>
 or the Druze, they are a little island of diversity in a
 world which is becoming homogenized by globalism.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some additional notes:
 The Yezidi 'Sacred Books' are reputedly never shown to strangers.
 This book includes a set of translations from an Arabic manuscript
 given to Joseph by a Muslim which purport to be the text of these books.
 However, I have been unable to find any other third party translation of
 these texts, so <i>caveat lector</i>.
