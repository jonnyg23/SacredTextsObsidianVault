 <p></p><dir>My understanding surrounds the truth of things,<br> And my truth is mixed up in me,<br> And the truth of my descent is set forth by itself,<br> And when it was known it was altogether in me.<br> And all that are in the universe are under me,<br> And all the habitable parts and deserts,<br> And everything created is under me,<br> And I am the ruling power preceding all that exists.<br> And I am he that spoke a true saying,<br> And I am the just judge and the ruler of the earth.<br> And I am he that men worship in my glory,<br> Coming to me and kissing my feet.<br> And I am he that spread over the heavens their height.<br> And I am he that cried in the beginning.<br> And I am he that of myself revealeth all things,<br> And I am he to whom came the book of good tidings<br> From my Lord, who burneth the mountains.<br> And I am he to whom all created men come<br> In obedience to kiss my feet.<br> I bring forth fruit from the first juice of early youth<br> By my presence, and turn toward me ray disciples.<br> And before this light the darkness of the morning cleared away.<br> I guide him that asketh for guidance.<br> I am he that caused Adam to dwell in Paradise<br> And Nimrod to inhabit a hot burning fire. <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a><br> And I am he that guided Ahmed the just,<br> And let him into my path and way.<br> And I am he unto whom all creatures<br> Come for my good purposes and gifts.<br> And I am he that visited all the heights,<br> And goodness and charity proceed from my mercy.<br> And I am he that made all hearts to fear<br> My purpose, and they magnify the majesty and power of my awfulness.<br> And I am he to whom the destroying lion came<br> Raging, and I shouted against him. and he became stone.<br> And I am he to whom the serpent came,<br> And by my will I made him dust.<br> And I am he that struck the rock and made it tremble,<br> And made to burst from its sides the sweetest of waters. <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">36</font></a><br> And I am he that sent down the certain truth;<br> For me is the book that comforteth the oppressed.<br> And I am he that judged justly,<br> And when I judged it was my right<br> And I am he that made the springs <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">36</font></a> to give water, 
 <br> Sweeter and pleasanter than all waters.<br> And I am he that caused it to appear in my mercy,<br> And by my power I called it the pure.<br> And I am he to whom the Lord of heaven hath said,<br> Thou art the just judge and Ruler of the earth.<br> And I am he that disclosed some of my wonders,<br> And some of my virtues are manifested in that which exists.<br> And I am he that caused the mountains to bow,<br> To move under me and at my will. <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">37</font></a>
 <br> And I am he before whose majesty the wild beasts cried;<br> They turned to me worshiping, and kissed my feet.<br> And I am Adî aš-Šâmî, the son of Musâfir. <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a><br> Verily the All-Merciful has assigned unto me names,<br> The heavenly throne, and the seat, and the (seven) heavens, and the earth.<br> In the secret of my knowledge there is no God but me.<br> These things are subservient to my power.<br> O mine enemies, why do you deny me?<br> O men, deny me not, but submit.<br> In the day of judgment you will be happy in meeting me.<br> Who dies in my love, I will cast him<br> In the midst of Paradise, by my will and pleasure;<br> But he that dies unmindful of me<br> Will be thrown into torture in misery and affliction.<br> I say I am the only one and the exalted;<br> I create and make rich those whom I will.<br> Praise it to myself, for all things are by my will,<br> And the universe is lighted by some of my gifts.<br> I am the king that magnifies himself,<br> And all the riches of creation are at my bidding.<br> I have made known unto you, O people, some of my ways.<br> Who desireth me must forsake the world.<br> And I can also speak the true saying,<br> And the garden on high is for those who do my pleasure.<br> I sought the truth and became a confirming truth;<br> And by the like truth shall they, like myself, possess the highest place.</dir>
