 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1054">1054</a></font></span>P’hatman, Usen's wife, met him in front of the door, joyful she saluted him, she showed her pleasure; they greeted each other, they went in and seated themselves. As I have observed, his coming annoyed not Dame P’hatman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1055">1055</a></font></span>Dame P’hatman was attractive to the eye, not young but brisk, of a good figure, dark in complexion, plump-faced, not wizened, a lover of (female) minstrels and singers, a wine-drinker; she had abundance of elegant gowns and head-dresses.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1056">1056</a></font></span>That night Dame P’hatman entertained him right well. The knight presented beautiful gifts; they that received them said: "They are worthy!" P’hatman's entertainment of him was worth while; by God! she lost not. When they had drunken and eaten, the knight went outs to sleep.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1057">1057</a></font></span>In the morning he showed all his wares, he had them all unpacked; the fairest were laid aside for the king, he had the price counted out; he said to the merchants: "Take them away!" He loaded them, (and) had them carried away. He said: "Sell as ye will; reveal not who I am!"</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1058">1058</a></font></span>The knight was clad as a merchant; he was by no means dressed in his proper raiment. Sometimes P’hatman calls on him, sometimes he visits P’hatman. They sat together; they conversed with refined discourse. Absence from him was death to P’hatman, as Ramin's was to Vis. <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
