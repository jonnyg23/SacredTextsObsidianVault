 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="363">363</a></font></span>"I saw the letter; it was from her for whom fire consumes my heart. The sunbeam wrote: 'O lion! let not thy wound appear. I am thine. Die not, but I hate vain fainting. Now Asmat’h tells thee all that is spoken by me.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="364">364</a></font></span>"'Pitiful fainting and dying, what love dost thou think this! It is better to exhibit to the beloved deeds of heroism. All dwellers in Khatavet’hi are our tributaries; now their ill-will towards us cannot be borne by us.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="365">365</a></font></span>"'I was desirous to wed thee even before, but hitherto I have not found opportunity to speak. The other day I saw thee deprived of reason sitting in the litter; then I heard all that had befallen thee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="366">366</a></font></span>"'I will tell thee truth; hearken to this that I say to thee: Go, do battle with the Khatavians, exhibit thyself to me in a goodly manner, this is better for thee. Weep idly no more; why moisten more the rose! What more can the sun do to thee! Behold, I have turned thy darkness to dawn.'</p>
