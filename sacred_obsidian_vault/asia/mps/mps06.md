   <h3 align="center">III</h3>  <h3 align="center">AVT’HANDIL'S LETTER TO HIS VASSALS</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="164">164</a></font></span> He wrote as follows: "My vassals, my instructors and some my pupils, faithful, trusty and tried, attentive to my behests like shadows, hearken to my letter all assembled!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="165">165</a></font></span> "Give ear! I, Avt’handil, earth beneath your feet, write this unto you; with mine own hand have I written this epistle. For a little while I have preferred roaming to drink and song; for bread and meat I shall trust to my bow and thumb.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="166">166</a></font></span> "I have in hand a certain matter which makes me journey to a far country; I depart alone, and this year shall I travel. I ask you only this: I beseech you let me find the realm unshaken by the foe.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="167">167</a></font></span> "I have appointed Shermadin to be lord in my stead; until he learn of my life or death he will shine upon you all like the sun; he will make the rose to be frosted and not fade, he will cause all misdoers to melt away like wax.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="168">168</a></font></span> You know, too, how he has grown up with me like a brother and like a son; you must obey him as if he were Avt’handil; let him make to sound the trumpet, do everything as I have hitherto done; if I come not at the time appointed, mourning and not laughter will be seemly, to you."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="169">169</a></font></span> The eloquent and nice-worded one ended this letter, he tied gold round his waist, habited himself to travel alone; he said: "I shall mount in the plain." The soldiers formed in line, then they came forth; he tarried no time indoors.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="170">170</a></font></span> He said: "Let all go hence; herein I need none as a partisan." He sent the slaves away also, he remained by himself, alone he withdrew himself, he hastened through the rushes. His slayer, T’hinat’hin, is always in his thoughts.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="171">171</a></font></span> He galloped over that plain; he was lost to the soldiers’ sight. Whatever human being might have seen him and pursued him, his sword could not harm him; his arm was hampered. He was heavy laden with a burden of grief for her sake.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="172">172</a></font></span> When the soldiers hunted and sought their lord, and could no longer find the sun-faced, their countenances paled, their great joy turned into heaviness, they ran everywhere to seek him, whoever had a swift horse,</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="173">173</a></font></span> O lion, whom can God put in thy place! They ran and brought out other messengers from elsewhere; they could learn nothing of him; he passed from that place. His disheartened hosts shed hot tears.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="174">174</a></font></span> Shermadin assembled together the courtiers and nobles; he showed them the letter in which he (Avt’handil) had told them his tidings. When they heard it, all remained heart-pierced, they beat themselves, there was not a tearless heart, not an unbruised breast.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="175">175</a></font></span> All said: "Though our state without him is irksome to us, to whom save thee could he give his seat and throne? Of a truth we shall obey thee, whatever thou commandest any of us." They made that vassal lord; all did him homage.</p>
