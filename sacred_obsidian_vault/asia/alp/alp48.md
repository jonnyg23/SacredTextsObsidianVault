 <p></p><dir>THE Hawk said to the Dove, "My dear,<br> Why dost thou shed tear after tear,<br> That go to swell the streamlet clear?"<br> The Dove said to the Hawk, "I fear<br> That spring is gone and autumn's here;<br> The rills have ceased their glad career,<br> The leaves and flowers are dead and sere,<br> The partridges no more we hear;<br> So I shall weep in my despair,<br> And from my eyes shed many a tear:--<br> How shall I find my babies' fare?"<br> He said, "Weep not this autumn drear,<br> For spring will come another year,<br> And sunshine bring the world its cheer,<br> And Hope shall for the poor appear.<br> Upon my pinions thee I'll bear<br> Where those tall trees their summit rear,<br> And high upon those mountains bare<br> I'll build a nest with tender care,<br> I'll make for thee a dwelling there,--<br> A hearth laid in that rocky lair,<br> With chimney open to the air;<br> The smoke shall to the clouds repair--<br> And to the South Wind fly our care!"<br> Autumn gave place to springtime fair,</dir>

 <p></p><dir>The rills were loosed on their career<br> And went to swell the streamlet clear,<br> Like blood-drops from the boulders bare.<br> Bright yellow flowers the hills did wear,<br> And violets, with perfume rare,<br> And flowers of countless colours fair;<br> And birds with music filled the air,<br> And bleating lambs called everywhere<br> To God for all His love and care.</dir>
