 <p></p><dir>WHENCE comest thou, my moon, gentle and still,<br> Spreading thy light o’er meadow, vale, and hill,<br> And o’er this patriarch, that lost in thought<br> The midnight plains of Avarair has sought<br> Whereon our fathers, martyred for the right,<br> As giants fell, to rise as angels bright!<br> Com'st thou to spread upon their ashes cold<br> From yonder snowy cloud a pall of gold?<br> Or would’st thou bind around thy brow of light<br> A token of Armenia's life-blood bright?-<br> Or art thou still in awestruck wonder lost<br> To think how Vartan fell, with all his host;--<br> Leaving death's shadow in his foeman's breast,<br> Trusting his soul to God, he sank to rest!  
 <p>And thou, Dughmood, that stained with blood I see<br> Winding amongst thy rushes sobbingly;<br> Thou breeze that from Magou's steep rock dost waft,<br> Or from great Ararat descendest soft;--<br> Thou too like me dost tremble, and thy wings<br> Listlessly bear thee on thy wanderings:<br> O’er hill and dale thou fliest, from wood to wood,<br> Till on this plain thou stay’st thy wings to brood;<br> Then bearest on this careworn heart's last sigh<br> To echo in Armenia ere it die!</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>O friend of aching hearts, soul of the rose,<br> That breakest with thy voice the night's repose;<br> Sing, little Nightingale, from yonder tree--<br> Armenia's deathless heroes sing with me!<br> From Thaddeus' convent as thy voice I heard,<br> Praying before the cross, my heart was stirred.<br> I hastened forth beneath thy magic spell<br> And found thee on the plain where Vartan fell.  
 <p>Ah, Nightingale of Avaraïr, they say<br> No bird art thou that nightly sing’st thy lay,<br> But Eghishé, the singer wondrous sweet,<br> That in the rose's heart Vartan dost greet.<br> The winter drives thee far away to mourn;<br> Spring's roses bid thee to Ardaz return,<br> In Eghishé's sad notes to sob and cry,<br> To call Vartan, and list for a reply.</p>  
 <p>If ever like the fainting Nightingale's<br> My voice with you, Togarmah's sons, prevails,--<br> Sons of those fathers virtuous and wise,<br> Who with their glories filled books, plains, and skies;--<br> If of Armenian blood one drop should flow<br> Within your veins, or make your hearts to glow;<br> Or if their glories past you too would share,<br> To Ardaz with the patriarch repair!</p></dir>
