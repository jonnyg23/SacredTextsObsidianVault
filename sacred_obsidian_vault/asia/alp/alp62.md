 <p></p><dir>UNUTTERABLE silence here is spread<br> On every hand, and Nature might be dead.<br> A lonely exile, here I sit and weep,<br> And far above, bright Moon, I see thee sweep.  
 <p>From Earth's creation till the skies shall parch<br> And she dissolve, thou circlest Heaven's high arch:<br> Saw’st thou the laurels on Armenia's brow?<br> And dost behold her hopeless sorrows now?</p>  
 <p>Mournful as I! I wonder dost thou see<br> How she is ground by heels of tyranny!<br> And do thine eyes with bitter tear-drops smart<br> When barbèd arrows pierce her through the heart</p>  
 <p>Thy heart is stone, thy pity stark and cold,<br> For fields of innocent blood thou dost behold<br> Without a word, and o’er Armenia's land<br> Thy nightly compass of the dome hast spanned<br> With all the brightness that was thine of old.</p>  
 <p>     .        .        .        .        .        .</p>  
 <p>O Lake, make answer! Why be silent more?<br> Wilt not lament with one whose heart is sore?<br> And you, ye Zephyrs, hurl the waters high<br> That I may feed them from a mourner's eye!</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>A garden once, luxuriantly fair,<br> Now is Armenia choked with thorn and tare:<br> Thou who hast seen her fortunes wax and wane,<br> Tell me, I pray thee! Must she thus remain?  
 <p>Must this unhappy nation ever be<br> By foreign princes held in slavery?<br> Is the Armenian and his stricken race<br> Counted unworthy in God's judgment-place?</p>  
 <p>Comes there a day, comes there a season that<br> Shall hail a flag on topmost Ararat,<br> Calling Armenians, wheresoe’er they roam,<br> To seek once more their loved and beauteous home?</p>  
 <p>Hard tho’ it be, O heavenly Ruler, raise<br> Armenia's spirit, and her heart's dark ways<br> Light with Thy knowledge: understanding so<br> The mystery of life, her works shall show<br> That all she does is ordered to Thy praise.</p>  
 <p>     .        .        .        .        .        .</p>  
 <p>Then suddenly the surface of the lake<br> Grew luminous, and from its depths did break<br> A lovely maid that bore a lantern and<br> A lyre of shining ivory in her hand.<br> Was she an Angel in a strange disguise?<br> Was she a Houri fled from Paradise?<br> Nay, rather was she of the form and hue<br> Of the Armenian Muses!<br>                            "Tell me true,<br> O Muse," I cried, "our people's destiny!<br> Speak of the Now and of the Yet-to-be!"</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>Then the sweet heavenly Spirit made reply,<br> "Wipe, O sad youth, the salt tears from thine eye!<br> I bring glad tidings: better days shall break,<br> New days of joy, that carry in their wake<br> The reign of God, Whose will is free and just:<br> A Golden Age again shall gild the dust!  
 <p>"Armenia's Muses shall awake anew,<br> And her Parnassus bloom with vernal hue,<br> And the bright car Apollo whirls on high<br> Shall sweep the shadows from her clouded sky.</p>  
 <p>"For many a day, like thee, we mourned aloud<br> While the thick darkness wrapped her in its shroud:<br> Now, O belovèd, may the weeping cease,--<br> To us has come the olive branch of peace!</p>  
 <p>"Cleanse from thy lute the rust that soils its string;<br> Hasten thee back, and, as thou goest, sing<br> Such joyful lays as yet may re-inspire<br> Hearts that are dead with new and tameless fire.<br> His Will is done; the Time is here; the Day<br> Dawns; and the Morning Star, so God doth say,<br> Shall be thy sign."<br>                       Then darkness fell again;<br> The vision fled; but long there did remain<br> An echo of the thrilling voice, that blended<br> With the wild waves whose depths she had descended;<br> And flowery perfumes filled the air like rain.</p>  
 <p>O message dear, and sweet prophetic strain!<br> What happiness is come to us, but Oh!<br> Beautiful Muse, yet one thing would we know--<br> Can a dead corpse rise up and live again?</p>
