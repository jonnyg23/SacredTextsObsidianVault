 <p align="center">(1102-1173)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>ONCE more God hither moves their course;<br> With countless infantry and horse,<br> As swell the waves towards the strand,<br> Fierce and tempestuous, they land.<br> Like sands that by the ocean lie,<br> Or like the stars that strew the sky,<br> They fill the earth where’er they go<br> And whiten it as wool or snow.<br> Their voice is like the northern wind,<br> Driving the storm-cloud from behind.<br> They clear the land from end to end,<br> The unbelievers forth they send,<br> Redeeming from such hopeless plight<br> All Christians held within their might.<br> Now in the churches cold and dark,<br> Once more shall burn the taper's spark;<br> And you, my sons, late forced to flee<br> To distant lands, afar from me,<br> Shall now return in chariots fair<br> Drawn by brave steeds with trappings rare.<br> And I shall lift mine eyes above<br> Beholding near me those I love.<br> My arms about you I shall fold,<br> Rejoicing with a joy untold;<br> And my black robes aside will lay<br> To dress in greens and crimsons gay.</dir>
