 <p></p><dir>THE sun has touched the mountain's crest,<br> The partridge rises from her nest;<br> And down the hillside tripping fast,<br> Greets all the flowers as she goes past.  
 <p>I breakfast on my roof at morn<br> When to my ear her voice is borne--<br> When swinging from the mountain side,<br> She chirps her song in all her pride.</p>  
 <p>Thy nest is dewed with summer showers;<br> Basil, narcissus, lotus flowers,<br> Enamel it, and breathe to thee<br> Perfumes of immortality.</p>  
 <p>Soft feathers all thy body deck,<br> Small is thy beak, and long thy neck.<br> Thy wings are worked with colours rare,<br> The dove is not so sweet and fair.</p>  
 <p>The little partridge flies aloft<br> Upon the branch, and warbles soft;<br> He cheers the world, and heals the smart<br> When seas of blood well in the heart.</p></dir>
