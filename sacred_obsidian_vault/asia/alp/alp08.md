 <p></p><dir>BELOVÈD one, for thy sweet sake,<br> By whirlwinds tossed and swayed I roam;<br> The stranger's accents round me wake<br> These burning thoughts that wander home.<br> No man such longings wild can bear<br> As in my heart forever rise.<br> Oh that the wind might waft me there<br> Where my belovèd's vineyard lies!<br> Oh that I were the zephyr fleet,<br> That bends her vines and roses sweet.  
 <p>For I am piteous and forlorn,<br> As is the bird that haunts the night;<br> Who inconsolably doth mourn<br> Whene’er his rose is from his sight.<br> O’er earth and ocean, everywhere<br> I gaze in vain, with weary eyes.<br> Oh that the wind might waft me there<br> Where my belovèd's vineyard lies!<br> Oh that I were the zephyr fleet<br> That bends her vines and roses sweet.</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>I would I were yon cloud so light,--<br> Yon cloudlet driven before the wind.<br> Or yonder bird with swift-winged flight:<br> My heart's true way I soon would find!<br> Oh, I would be the wind so fleet<br> That bends her vines and roses sweet.</dir>
