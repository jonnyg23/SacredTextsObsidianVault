 <p></p><dir>DARK forests clothe the mountain-side,<br>      And o’er that mountain's lofty head<br> The heavens bend their arches wide,<br>      And, dome-like, round its summit spread.  
 <p>A castle stood upon the steep,<br>      Enchanted by a witch's spell;<br> A maiden wept within the keep,<br>      Bound by the chains of slav’ry fell.</p>  
 <p>Alone and sad, the maiden fair<br>      Sat in her dark and narrow room.<br> No hope had she, but dire despair<br>      Had worn her heart with thoughts of gloom.</p>  
 <p>A minstrel passed--as it befell<br>      A singer, singing sweetest strains;<br> He broke the witch's evil spell,<br>      And loosed the gentle maiden's chains.</p>  
 <p>She ran to him and kissed his face,<br>      And said, "How I have longed for thee!<br> God, in His mercy and His grace,<br>      Hath sent thee here to set me free!"</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>And when, above the mountain steep,<br>      The moon shone out her silver light,<br> And when the stars began to peep,<br>      Twinkling and scatt’ring jewels bright,  
 <p>The minstrel's love stole out unseen,<br>      With burning thoughts of her belov’d;<br> All through the woods so dark and green,<br>      Seeking, and seeking him, she roved.</p>  
 <p>A hut there was within that wood,<br>      Meet dwelling for some dervish old;<br> All lined with moss and leaves, it stood<br>      Protected from the rain and cold.</p>  
 <p>The minstrel lived within this nook,<br>      And sang alone beneath the trees.<br> His friend--Firdausi's wondrous book,<br>      His comrades--Sadi and Hafiz.</p>  
 <p>The Houri of the castle there<br>      Spent many happy days and nights--<br> Immortal souls in Jennet <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">1</font></a> fair<br>      Have never tasted such delights.</p>  
 <p>He wiped the tears by sorrow shed,<br>      And healed the wounds by sorrow wrought;<br> Like captive from a prison fled,<br>      Her cares and woes she soon forgot.</p>  
 <p>Broken and aged was her sire;<br>      A mighty Prince, the castle's lord,<br> To satisfy his heart's desire,<br>      Had reft her from him with his sword.</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>The Prince held office high at court,<br> And countless women, bright as day,<br> Lived in his harem's vile resort,<br> And slaves, more than my tongue can say.  
 <p>His women, guarded day and night,<br> Caged in with iron bars he keeps;<br> But LOVE, more strong than despot's might,<br> Breaks through that cage, those bars o’erleaps.</p></dir>
