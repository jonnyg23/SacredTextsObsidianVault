 <p></p><dir>THE little fox, the wolf and bear made peace;<br> Like kinsfolk all, they bade their warfare cease.<br> The fox they consecrate a hermit now;--<br> False monk, false hermit, false recluse's vow!  
 <p>The little fox a sack found in the street<br> Through which he thrust his head; then shod his feet<br> With iron shoes, and got a staff, I trow--<br> False monk, false hermit, false recluse's vow!</p>  
 <p>The fox has sent the wolf to fetch the bear.<br> "For him," he said, "I live this life of care;<br> Yet never hath he sent me aught to eat:--<br> Sore are my knees with walking, sore my feet!"</p>  
 <p>At morning dawn forth to the hunt they creep;<br> A ram they catch, a lambkin and a sheep.<br> Holy dispenser is the wolf proclaimed--<br> Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!</p>  
 <p>He gives the sheep as portion to the bear;<br> The lambkin falls to the poor hermit's share.<br> "The ram for me," he said, "I'm tired and lamed"--<br> Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>The bear was wroth, and turned him round about,<br> And with one blow the wolf's two eyes put out.<br> "That sheep for me, a bear so great and famed?<br> Unjust dispenser, judge unwisely named!"  
 <p>The little fox is sore afraid, and sees<br> A trap laid ready with a piece of cheese.<br> "O uncle, see, I've built a convent here,"<br> He said, "a place of rest, a place of prayer!"</p>  
 <p>The bear stretched out his paw for the repast,<br> The trap upon his neck closed hard and fast.<br> "Help me, my little nephew, for I fear<br> This is no convent, ’tis no house of prayer!"</p>  
 <p>The little fox with joy beheld the whole<br> And sang a mass for his great uncle's soul.<br> "The wrong thou didst the wolf has brought thee there;<br> It is a house of rest, a house of prayer!"</p>  
 <p>O sovereign Justice, much thou pleasest me--<br> Who wrongs another soon shall cease to be.<br> And fasting in the trap must lie the bear,--<br> For ’tis a house of rest, a house of prayer!"</p></dir>
