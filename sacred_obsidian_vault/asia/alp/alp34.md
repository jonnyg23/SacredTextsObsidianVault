 <p></p><dir>NIGHTINGALE, oh, leave our garden,<br> Where soft dews the blossoms steep;<br> With thy litanies melodious<br> Come and sing my son to sleep!<br> Nay, he sleeps not for thy chanting,<br> And his weeping hath not ceased.<br> Come not, nightingale! My darling<br> Does not wish to be a priest.  
 <p>O thou thievish, clever jackdaw,<br> That in coin findest thy joy,<br> With thy tales of gold and profit<br> Come and soothe my wailing boy!<br> Nay, thy chatter does not lull him,<br> And his crying is not stayed.<br> Come not, jackdaw! for my darling<br> Will not choose the merchant's trade.</p>  
 <p>Wild dove, leave the fields and pastures<br> Where thou grievest all day long;<br> Come and bring my boy sweet slumber<br> With thy melancholy song!<br> Still he weeps. Nay, come not hither,<br> Plaintive songster, for I see<br> That he loves not lamentations,<br> And no mourner will he be.</p>  
 <p>Leave thy chase, brave-hearted falcon!<br> Haply he thy song would hear.<br> And the boy lay hushed, and slumbered,<br> With the war-notes in his ear.</p>
