 <p align="center">(1851-1908)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>A GREAT black bird like to a great black cloud<br> Hovers forever o’er my spirit bowed.<br> He is my guardian angel, but alack!<br> Darker than night he is--than hell more black.  
 <p>A fearful-looking bird, with wings wide spread,<br> Ill-omened as the Devil, and as dread;<br> He hovers round my wasted body, till<br> I wonder if I yet have life or will.</p>  
 <p>Upon his wings no spot of white appears,<br> His plumage black sheds horror down, and fears.<br> Black are his talons--sharp, like daggers fell;<br> And like a hound I hear him howl and yell.</p>  
 <p>His wide-spread pinions hide the light from me;<br> Heaven dark, and earth a dungeon black I see.<br> All is in shadow--air and earth and skies--<br> He even hides the lightning from my eyes.</p>  
 <p>I cannot see the paleness of my face,<br> I cannot see the maiden's smiling grace;<br> Black is the lake, the stars and lilies dark;<br> What was that cry? The bird's dread calling!--Hark!</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>I seem to totter on the brink of hell<br> And think the evil fowl my corpse can smell.<br> I seem to hear the goblins fight with him--<br> "Away with thee!--ours is this booty grim!"  
 <p>But he is cruel, strong, and merciless--<br> This great black bird;--he heeds not my distress.<br> Ten years I've lived beneath his deadly wings--<br> Ten years unceasingly my death-bell rings.</p>  
 <p>Ten years ago one night it came to pass<br> On Moda's rock I sat and dreamed; alas,<br> My foe came to me--Carnal was his name:<br> He shouted, "Vain are Life and Love and Fame!"</p>  
 <p>Youthful I was, and armed with Love and Hope<br> I struggled. "Oh, my soul, arise and cope<br> With this thy foe, and vanquish him," I cried.<br> But ’twas in vain, as I full soon espied.</p>  
 <p>My sun and joy since then are on the wane.<br> My foe cries out, "I, only I, shall reign!<br> O’er all the universe none rules but me!"--<br> Then rose a Siren's voice alluringly. . . .</p>  
 <p>Nirvana and the flesh held me that hour:<br> God was asleep--my soul was in their power.<br> Then on the moon I saw a spot appear;--<br> It grew, and grew . . . my heart turned sick with fear.</p>  
 <p>I was as dead. The carrion-eating bird<br> Had left that heavenly corpse--the moon--allured<br> To earth by me. It sought my bosom where<br> The image of Christ crucified lay bare.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>Beneath those evil wings I hopelessly<br> Roam over the earth;--my guardian angel he;<br> No more the cross I wear, nor in my breast<br> Dwells holy faith; ’tis death: death without rest.  
 <p>Like to the moon, whether I wax or wane<br> Still am I lifeless, cursed with this bane.<br> I give the vulture of my flesh to tear,<br> And shiver when the name of "love" I hear.</p>  
 <p>While yet I live he is devouring me:<br> I cannot bear this pain--Oh, set me free!<br> I am not dead--Love still dwells with me here.<br> I am alive--and some call me the "Ner." <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ah, gruesome bird, art thou not yet content<br> These ten long years my body to have rent?<br> Ah, vulture black--black earth and ebon sky,<br> ’Tis time that I should lay me down and die.</p></dir>
