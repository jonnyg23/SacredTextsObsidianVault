 <p></p><dir>WITHOUT thee what are song and dance to me?<br> The castagnettes I throw down wearily.<br> My heart and thoughts are ever filled with thee,<br> So rhymes and verses leave me, one by one.  
 <p>How can one bandage serve for gashes twain?<br> How on two masters wait a single swain?<br> Would not one gardener tend two groves in vain?<br> For he must graft the saplings one by one.</p>  
 <p>Well said our fathers, speaking of such woes,<br> "I made a garden, others plucked the rose.<br> Theirs was the sweetness, mine the thorny close."<br> In sooth these things befell me one by one!</p>  
 <p>Without thee what are riches unto me?<br> What worth could I in silks or cashmeres see?<br> Arrayed in rags and sackcloth I would be,<br> Wandering around the convents, one by one,</p>  
 <p>To meet perchance with some one, who might tell,<br> My fair one, how to free me from thy spell;<br> For Sayat Nova's torments far excel<br> The Seven Wise Men's complaints told one by one!</p></dir>
