 <p></p><dir>THE fox ran up into the mill,<br> He raised his paws, and danced his fill.<br>       Brave Master Fox, ’tis but your due,<br>       In all the world there's none like you!  
 <p>A peck of corn he ground that day,<br> Which on his back he bore away.</p>  
 <p>He ate the village chickens brown,<br> And trod the upland cornfields down.</p>  
 <p>The fox lies on his shaggy side,<br> His paws stretched out before him wide.</p>  
 <p>Sable and fox this fall we'll catch,<br> And for my son I'll make a match.</p>  
 <p>Alas, this year no price they made:--<br> My Hovhannes unmarried stayed!</p></dir>
