 <p>THE Andamanese have a number of stories which are told to the younger people by their elders and relate to the doings of their ancestors in a time long ago. Some of these stories are recorded in the present chapter. A difficulty in the way of giving any clear and readable account of them is the fact that there are many slightly different versions of one and the same legend. To some extent the variations are local, each tribe, and even each portion of a tribe having its own set of legendary stories. Besides these local variations there are also individual variations. Two men of the same tribe may relate what is substantially the same story, yet each chooses his own words and gestures, and to some extent they may even arrange the incidents differently.</p>  
 <p>In the last chapter it was mentioned that there are certain individuals, known as <i>oko-ǰumu</i> in the North Andaman and <i>oko-paiad</i> in the South, who are believed to have special knowledge as to the spirits and as to the magical efficacy of remedies for sickness. It is these <i>oko-ǰumu</i> also who are the authorities on the legendary lore of the Andamanese. In the case of magical remedies there is a certain common stock of beliefs as to the efficacy to be attributed to different substances, such as leaves of different plants, and on the basis of these beliefs the <i>oko-ǰumu</i> elaborates the remedies that he uses in particular cases. Each <i>oko-ǰumu</i>, however, prides himself on being, to some extent, original. An example of this has been already mentioned. When a great storm arose an <i>oko-ǰumu</i> of one of the Northern tribes succeeded in stopping it (in the belief of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>the natives) by placing a piece of the crushed stem of the <i>Anadendron</i> creeper under a particular stone in the sea. On a later occasion another storm arose, and the successor of the first-mentioned <i>oko-ǰumu</i> was appealed to that he might exert his powers. He did not simply imitate his predecessor, but he placed a piece of crushed bark and twigs of the <i>Ficus</i><i> laccifera</i> in the sea under a different stone. In very much the same way there is a common stock of beliefs as to the events that took place in the time of the ancestors, but each <i>oko-ǰumu</i> builds up on this basis his own particular set of legends, so that it is rarely that two of them tell the same story in the same way. An <i>oko-ǰumu</i> may obtain for himself a reputation by relating legends of the ancestors in a vivid and amusing way. Such a man would be able to invent new stories by combining together in his own way some of the traditional incidents. The desire on the part of each <i>oko-ǰumu</i> to be original and so to enhance his own reputation is a fertile source of variation in the legends.</p>  
 <p>This lack of traditional form, which is a very important characteristic of the Andamanese mythology, may be compared with their lack of traditional songs. Just as every man composes his own songs, so, within certain limits, every <i>oko-ǰumu</i> relates in his own way the legends of his tribe. But whereas every man is a composer of songs, only a certain number are regarded as having authority to speak on the legends.</p>  
 <p>Underlying the legends of any tribe there are a certain number of beliefs or representations with which every native is familiar. It is on the basis of these that the <i>oko-ǰumu</i> elaborates his own doctrine, if we may call it so, which he hands on to his followers, who in turn may become <i>oko-ǰumu</i> and produce further slight modifications of their own. Thus the legends are continually being changed, though in any one generation the changes introduced are slight, and it would take a long time for important changes in belief to be brought about. There is evidence, however, that a succession of leading men in the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe have succeeded in introducing a new doctrine as to the weather, making <i>Bilik</i> the name of a class of beings instead of the name of a single being, and that this</p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>doctrine, while it has not entirely ousted the former beliefs, has yet succeeded in gaining currency not only in the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe, but also in the <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> and <i><u>O</u>k<u>o</u>-J̌uw<u>o</u>i</i> tribes.</p>  
 <p>At the present time it is only possible to recover a small part of the many different legends with their variants. The introduction of many new interests into the lives of the natives, through the European settlement and the many changes it has produced, has caused the ancient legends to be neglected. Most of the old <i>oko-ǰumu</i> have died without leaving any followers to take their place. Many of the legends recorded here are merely what some of the men not specially skilled in legendary lore can remember of the stories told them in former days by <i>oko-ǰumu</i> who are now dead.</p>  
 <p>One feature of the legends that must be pointed out is their unsystematic nature. The same informant may give, on different occasions, two entirely different versions of such a thing as the origin of fire, or the beginning of the human race. The Andamanese, to all appearance, regard each little story as independent, and do not consciously compare one with another. They thus seem to be entirely unconscious of what are obvious contradictions to the student of the legends. It is necessary to emphasise the fragmentary and unsystematic nature of the Andaman mythology because Mr Man, in his work on the Andamanese, has brought together a number of legends from the tribes of the South Andaman and has combined them into a continuous and fairly consistent narrative, and has thus, undoubtedly not intentionally, given a wrong impression to the reader of what the nature of the disconnected stories really is. While each of the stories included in Mr Man's account is derived directly from the natives, it would seem certain that the arrangement of them into a more or less consistent narrative is due to Mr Man.</p>  
 <p>In recording the legends in this chapter, only the English translation is given. In some cases the legends were translated on the spot and written down in English. In other cases they were written down in the native language and then translated. When I was recording the legends I very frequently had to ask what was meant by a particular statement, the meaning of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>which might be quite clear to a native, but which was obscure to one not accustomed to thinking in the same way as the natives. In some cases I could obtain no satisfactory explanation, and such legends are given in this chapter in as nearly as possible an exact literal translation of the original. In other cases the explanations given by the natives have been incorporated in the translation itself.</p>  
 <p>In order to give the reader a fair idea of the nature of the legends as they are told, one is here given in the native language (<i>Aka-Čari</i>) with a word-for-word translation.</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">

 <p>The above translation is hardly comprehensible without a little explanation. The word <i>iǰoko</i> means "something burns," the word ubiko means "he cooks (by roasting)." The compound <i>iǰokobiko</i> may mean either "he makes a fire and cooks something at it" or it may simply mean "he makes up a fire (by adding firewood)." The word <i>iǰokoduko</i> has a quite different meaning, "to produce fire." The derivation of <i>inǰuktertoia</i> is uncertain, as I am not sure of the proper use of <i>er-t<u>o</u>ia</i>; it is translated on the basis of the explanation given me by the man who told the story. The word ikterbie is descriptive of the dryness of dead leaves.</p>  
 <p>A free translation would be as follows: "It was Sir Prawn who first produced or obtained fire. Some yam leaves, being shrivelled and dry by reason of the hot weather, caught fire and burnt. The prawn made a fire with some firewood and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>went to sleep. The kingfisher stole fire and ran away with it. He made a fire and cooked some fish. When he had filled his belly he went to sleep. The dove stole fire from the kingfisher and ran away." It is implied that it was the dove who gave the fire to the ancestors of the Andamanese.</p>  
 <p>Versions of legends of the origin of fire are given by Mr Portman, in each of the languages of the Southern group of tribes <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>All the legends relate to events that are supposed to have happened in the past, and deal with the doings of the ancestors of the Andamanese. In the North Andaman the ancestors are sometimes called <i>Lau t’er-kuro</i>, i.e. the big spirits, "big" being used in the sense of our word "chief." Another term for them is <i>N’a-mai-koloko</i>, from <i>n’</i> or <i>nio</i> = they, <i>aka-mai</i> = father, and <i>koloko</i> = people, so that the phrase literally means "the father people," or the ancestors. In the South Andaman the ancestors are sometimes called <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i>, which is the equivalent of <i>Lau t’er-kuro</i>. Mr Man seems to have misunderstood the exact meaning of this term. He writes: "<i>Lači Lora-lola</i>, the chief of the survivors from the Deluge <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>, gave, at his death, the name of <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i> to their descendants......The <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i> are described as fine tall men with large beards, and they are said to have been long lived, but, in other respects and in their mode of living they did not differ from the present inhabitants. The name seems to have been borne till comparatively recent times, as a few still living are said to remember having seen the last of the so-called <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i>  <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man has evidently not realised that the term <i>čauga</i> cannot be applied to any living Andamanese, but may be applied to every dead one. The <i>Čauga</i> are the spirits of dead natives, and new <i>Čauga</i> are continually coming into existence by death. Any person who is of such importance when alive as to form the subject of legends or stories after his death may be distinguished (after his death only) as a <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i>. The name may thus be applied to the purely mythical ancestors of the legends, and also to the spirits of men recently dead</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>whose memory is preserved owing to fame acquired in some way when they were alive. It is thus possible that some of the natives with whom Mr Man formerly conversed are now <i>Čauga tabaŋa</i>, i.e. big spirits, having been " big men " when they were alive.</p>  
 <p>Another name sometimes used in the South Andaman to denote the ancestors is <i>Tomo-la</i> <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This word, however, is sometimes used in the singular to denote the mythical first man. Its use is thus similar to that of the name <i>Bilik</i> in the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe, which is used both as the name of a single mythical being and also as the name of a class of beings. Only the early ancestors of the Andamanese, i.e. those about whom the legends are related, can be called <i>Tomo-la</i>.</p>  
 <p>Among the ancestors who appear in the legends there are a few who bear names that are used as personal names of men and women at the present time, and who appear in the legends simply as men and women. The larger number of the ancestors, however, bear names that are those of species of animals. In each case the ancestor is identified with the species which bears the same name. Yet others of the mythical ancestors have names that are neither personal names at the present day, nor names of animals. It may perhaps be supposed that in all such cases the name has some sort of meaning, but in many instances it was not found possible to discover the meaning with certainty.</p>  
 <p>When speaking of the ancestors, the natives generally add to the name the appropriate title. These titles are, in the North Andaman <i>Maia</i> (Sir) and <i>Mimi</i> (Lady), in <i>Akar-Bale</i> <i>Da</i> (Sir) and <i>In</i> (Lady), and in <i>Aka-Bea</i> <i>Maia</i> and <i>Čana</i>.</p>  
 <p>There are legends as to the origin of mankind, i.e., of their own race, for they did not recognize, until recently, the existence of any men of other races than their own, calling aliens <i>Lau</i> (spirits). There is, however, no unanimity in their beliefs as to how mankind originated, even in any one tribe. An <i>Aka-Bo</i> legend is as follows:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>"The first man was <i>J̌utpu</i> <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He was born inside the joint of a big bamboo, just like a bird in an egg <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The bamboo split and he came out. He was a little child. When it rained he made a small hut for himself and lived in it. He made little bows and arrows. As he grew bigger he made bigger huts, and bigger bows and arrows. One day he found a lump of quartz and with it he scarified himself. <i>J̌utpu</i> was lonely, living all by himself. He took some clay (<i>k<u>o</u>t</i>) from a nest of the white ants and moulded it into the shape of a woman. She became alive and became his wife. She was called <i>K<u>o</u>t</i>. They lived together at Teraut-buliu. Afterwards <i>J̌utpu</i> made other people out of clay. These were the ancestors. <i>J̌utpu</i> taught them how to make canoes and bows and arrows, and how to hunt and fish. His wife taught the women how to make baskets and nets and mats and belts, and how to use clay for making patterns on the body."</p>  
 <p>The same story was told me by <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> men, the only difference being that they gave the name of the place where <i>J̌utpu</i> lived differently, mentioning a spot in the <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> country.</p>  
 <p>From the <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> I also obtained what is really another version of the same legend, though the name of the first ancestor is given differently. "The first man came out of the buttress of a <i>p<u>o</u>ičo</i> (<i>Sterculia</i>) tree, and was called <i>P<u>o</u>ičotobut</i> (<i>Sterculia</i> buttress). He had no wife, so he cohabited with an ant's nest (<i>k<u>o</u>t</i>) and thus obtained a large number of children. These were the first Andamanese, and <i>P<u>o</u>ičotobut</i> taught them all their arts and customs. <i>P<u>o</u>ičotobut</i> lived at <i>Boroŋ Buliu</i> (in <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> country)."</p>  
 <p>The association between the origin of the Andamanese and an ant's nest (<i>k<u>o</u>t</i>) is retained in another legend, told by an <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> man. "<i>Tarai</i> (the south-west monsoon) was the first man. His wife was <i>K<u>o</u>t</i>. They lived at</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>Tarai-era-poŋ</i> <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Their children were <i>Tau</i> (the sky), <i>B<u>o</u>to</i> (wind), <i>Piribi</i> (storm), and <i>Air</i> (the foam on a rough sea)."</p>  
 <p>An entirely different legend, of which, however, I could not obtain a detailed version, is also found in the <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> tribe. This is to the effect that the first living being was Maia Čara <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He made the earth, and caused it to be peopled with inhabitants. He also made the sun and moon. In the last chapter Čara was mentioned as a mythical being associated with the sun, with daylight and with fine weather. One of my informants of the <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> tribe said that <i>Čara</i> had a wife named <i>Nimi</i> (a common personal name), and that his children were <i>Čeo</i> (knife), <i>Ina</i> (water), <i>Loto</i>, and <i>Luk</i>. It is <i>Maia Čara</i>, according to one commonly received account, who makes the daylight every day.</p>  
 <p>I could not obtain any <i>Aka-Kede</i> legend as to the origin of mankind. One informant of that tribe said that it was <i>Bilika</i> (the north-east monsoon) who made the world and the first men and women, but he could give me no detailed legend.</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> and <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribes there are several versions of a legend that makes the monitor lizard (<i>Varanus salvator</i>) the progenitor of the Andaman race. In all the versions there is no mention of how the lizard himself originated. The following was told me by an <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> man. "When <i>Ta P<u>e</u>ti</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard) was <i>aka g<u>o</u>i</i> (i.e. unmarried, but having completed the initiation ceremonies), he went into the jungle to hunt pig. He climbed up a <i>Dipterocarpus</i> tree, and got stuck there <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <i>Beyan</i> (civet-cat, <i>Paradoxurus</i>) found him there, stuck in the tree. She released him and helped him to get down. The two got married. Their children were the <i>Tomo-la</i> (i.e. the ancestors)."</p>  
 <p>Another legend telling how the monitor lizard obtained a wife was related to me on more than one occasion by <i>A-Pučikwar</i> men. "The first of the ancestors (<i>Tomo-la</i>) was <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard). He lived at <i>Tomo-la-tog</i>. At first he had</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>no wife. One day, when he was out fishing, he found a piece of black wood of the kind called <i>k<u>o</u>lotat</i> (<i>Diospyros</i> sp.). He found it in the creek, and brought it to his hut, where he put it on the little platform over the fire <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He sat down by the fire and set to work over an arrow that he was making. As he bent over his work he did not see what was happening. By and by he heard some one laugh, and looked up. Then he saw that the piece of wood had turned into a woman. He got up and took her down from the platform. She sat down with him and became his wife. They had a son named <i>P<u>o</u>i</i> (a species of small bird, possibly a woodpecker), and afterwards many other children. They lived together for a long time at <i>Tomo-la-tog</i>. One day <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> went fishing and was drowned in the creek. He turned into a <i>kara-duku</i>."</p>  
 <p>There is some doubt about the translation of the word <i>kara-duku</i>. It is an <i>Aka-Bea</i> word, although it was used as given above, by an <i>A-Pučikwar</i> man. Mr Man translates it "cachalot." Mr Portman says that <i>kara-duku</i> is "crocodile," but that the cachalot, the proper name of which is <i>biriga-ta</i>, is also sometimes called <i>kara-duku</i> <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The only authority for the existence of crocodiles in the Andamans is the statement of Mr Portman, who says that the natives killed one in the Middle Andaman and brought the bones to him. Although I was in many of the creeks of the Andamans at different times I never saw a crocodile, and none of the other officers of the Settlement, who have repeatedly explored a large part of the islands, ever seems to have seen one, so that the one recorded by Mr Portman may possibly have been a single one that had come oversea from the mainland of Asia.</p>  
 <p>Another <i>A-Pučikwar</i> account of the origin of the first woman <i>K<u>o</u>lotat</i>, is as follows: "At first there were no women, only men. A man called <i>K<u>o</u>lotat</i> came to live in the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> country. <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard) caught him and cut off his genitals and made him into a woman. She became his wife. Their children were the first of the ancestors (<i>Tomo-la</i>)."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>Another account given by members of the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe is that the first man was <i>Tomo</i>, or <i>Tomo-la</i>. One version that I heard is that <i>Tomo</i> made the world and peopled it with the ancestors. He made the moon (<i>Puki</i>) who is his wife. <i>Tomo</i> and his wife invented all the arts of the Andamanese and taught them to the ancestors. After his death <i>Tomo</i> went to live in the sky, where he now is. It is <i>Tomo</i> who sends the fine weather, while <i>Bilik</i> sends the bad weather. In the world where <i>Tomo</i> now lives it is always daylight and is always fine. When men die their spirits go up to the sky and live with <i>Tomo</i>. The man who gave me this version said that he did not know how <i>Tomo</i> originated, but was quite sure that he was not made by <i>Bilik</i>. <i>Tomo</i> came first and <i>Bilik</i> came afterwards. The Andamanese are all the children of <i>Tomo</i> <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In disagreement with this story, another man of the same tribe said that <i>Tomo</i> was made by <i>Bilik</i>. He (i.e., <i>Tomo</i>) had a wife <i>Mita</i> (Dove), and they were the ancestors of the Andamanese. Yet another informant said: "<i>Ta Tomo</i> was the first man. He made bows and arrows and canoes. His canoes were made of the wood of the Pandanus tree. <i>Mita</i> (Dove) was his wife. It was she who first made nets and baskets and discovered the uses of red paint and white clay." When I asked how <i>Tomo</i> and his wife originated my informant replied that he did not know.</p>  
 <p>A species of bird (perhaps a woodpecker), called <i>P<u>o</u>i</i> in <i>A-Pučikwar</i> and <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> in <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i>, is often said to have been the son of <i>Tomo</i>. I was once told that <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> was the first of the Andamanese, from whom they are all descended, and that his wife was Mita. Another informant said that <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> (Monitor Lizard) was the first man and <i>Mita</i> was his wife, while still another stated that <i>Ta Mita</i> (Sir Dove) was the progenitor of the race, making the dove male instead of female. These different versions will give some idea of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>contradictory nature of the statements of the Andamanese. All of them come from only two tribes, the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> and the <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i>.</p>  
 <p>From the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe I obtained the following legend. "<i>Puluga</i> made the first of the ancestors. He made one man and one woman called <i>Nyali</i> and <i>Irap</i> <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He gave them fire, and taught them how to hunt and fish, and how to make bows and arrows and baskets and nets. The place where they lived is called <i>Irap</i> because they lived there <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>Another <i>Akar-Bale</i> version is that the first man was <i>Da Duku</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard), and that his wife was <i>In Bain</i> (Lady Civet-cat).</p>  
 <p>Mr E. H. Man, in his account of the South Andaman, says that there are a few discrepancies in their accounts of the creation and origin of the human species, but in the main features all the natives with whom he spoke are agreed. The world was created by <i>Puluga</i>, who then made a man named <i>Tomo</i>, the first of the human race. <i>Tomo</i> was black, like the present Andamanese, but was much taller and bearded. <i>Puluga</i> showed him the various fruit-trees in the jungle, which then existed only at <i>Wota-emi</i>, a spot in the country of the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe. The wife of <i>Tomo</i> was <i>Čana Elewadi</i> (Lady Crab), and as to her origin there are different legends. According to some, <i>Puluga</i> created her after he had taught <i>Tomo</i> how to sustain life; others say that <i>Tomo</i> saw her swimming near his home and called to her, whereupon she landed and lived with him; while a third story represents her as coming pregnant to Kyd Island, where she gave birth to several male and female children, who subsequently became the progenitors of the present race. <i>Tomo</i> had two sons and two daughters by <i>Čana Elewadi</i>; the names of the former were <i>Biro-la</i> and <i>B<u>o</u>ro-la</i>, and of the latter <i>Rie-la</i> and <i>Č<u>o</u>rmi-la</i>.</p>  
 <p>A story that tells how <i>Tomo</i> came to his end states that</p>

 <p>one day, while hunting, he fell into the creek called <i>Yara-tig-ǰig</i> and was drowned. He was at once transformed into a <i>kara-duku</i> (which Mr Man translates as "cachalot"). <i>Čana Elewadi</i>, ignorant of the accident that had befallen her husband, went in a canoe with some of her grandchildren to ascertain the cause of his continued absence; on seeing them, <i>Kara-duku</i> upset their skiff and drowned his wife and most of her companions. She became a small crab, of a description still named after her, <i>elewadi</i>, and the others were transformed into lizards (<i>duku</i>). Another version of this story is that, wearied with an unsuccessful day's hunting, <i>Tomo</i> went to the shore, where he found a <i>čidi</i> (Pinna) shell-fish; while playing with it, it fastened on him, and he was unable to free himself until a <i>baian</i> (Paradoxurus) seized the <i>čidi</i> and liberated him at the expense of one of his members. Shortly after this he saw his wife and some of their children coming after him in a canoe; unwilling that they should become aware of the misfortune that had befallen him he upset the canoe, drowning its occupants and himself. He then became <i>kara-duku</i>, and the others <i>duku</i>, which are now plentiful in the jungles <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In some of the preceding legends reference is made to <i>Biliku</i> or <i>Puluga</i>. There is a very general belief, in all parts of the islands, that in the time of the ancestors, <i>Biliku</i> or <i>Puluga</i> lived on earth. Each tribe has at least one spot in its territory that is pointed out as the place where <i>Biliku</i> (or <i>Puluga</i>) lived. In some tribes there are three or four such places, each of which is claimed as the original home of <i>Biliku</i> by the people living in the neighbourhood. In many cases the name of the spot contains a reference to the legend, as <i>Puluga l’od-baraiǰ</i> (the village of <i>Puluga</i>) in <i>Akar-Bale</i> or <i>Biliku era-poŋ</i> (the cave of <i>Biliku</i>) in the North Andaman.</p>  
 <p>I was able to obtain a few legends relating to the time when <i>Biliku</i> lived on earth, though there were probably many more that I was not fortunate enough to hear.</p>  
 <p>The following is an <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> legend:</p>  
 <p>"In the time of the ancestors <i>Biliku</i> lived at <i>Ar-k<u>o</u>l</i>. One day the people caught a turtle and brought it to the camp.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>Biliku</i> was sitting there. They asked her if she would eat some of it. She said 'No.' They put the meat in the roof of the hut and went away. When they had gone <i>Biliku</i> ate the whole turtle. Then she went to sleep. The people came back and found the turtle gone. They said '<i>Biliku</i> has eaten it.' They left the camp and all went to <i>Tebi-čiro</i>. They left <i>Biliku</i> asleep. Some of the people went to hunt for turtle. Their canoe passed near <i>Ar-k<u>o</u>l</i>. <i>Biliku</i> saw the people in the canoe. She called to them and asked to be taken with them. The people refused saying 'You ate up all the turtle.' <i>Biliku</i> had a round stone and several <i>be</i> shells (pearl shells). She threw the shells at the people in the canoe. The first shell did not hit them but came back and fell at her feet; and so also with the second. Then <i>Biliku</i> got very angry and threw a third time. The shell struck the canoe and killed all the people in it. The canoe and its occupants became a reef of rocks that is still there. The other people at <i>Tebi-čiro</i> called across to <i>Biliku</i> saying 'Come over here.' She answered 'Very well! I am coming.' She took the stone that she had and put it in the sea, and it floated. She got on to it to cross over. When she had got half way across <i>Biliku</i> and her stone sank in the sea. They became two big rocks that are there still." This legend refers to the west coast of the North Andaman. The pearl shells that <i>Biliku</i> throws seem to be lightning, and the round stone the one that she rolls about to make thunder.</p>  
 <p>A few other statements about <i>Biliku</i> and <i>Tarai</i> from the four tribes of the North Andaman are given below just as they were taken down in my note-books.</p>  
 <p>(1) "<i>Biliku</i> lived at <i>Pura-’ra-poŋ</i> in the time of the ancestors. Her husband was <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> and her children <i>Totaimo</i>, <i>Mite</i> (cicada) and <i>Tarai</i>. She made the sun and the moon. It was she who first invented all the things that are now made and used by women, such as baskets, nets, etc., and it was she who discovered fire, and who first discovered the use of edible roots such as <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> and <i>mino</i> (two species of <i>Dioscorea</i>)."</p>  
 <p>(2) "<i>Biliku</i> used to live at <i>Čaura</i>. She had a husband</p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Tarai</i> and a son <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i>, and a daughter Mite. She used to live only on certain vegetable foods, <i>l<u>o</u>ito</i>, <i>pata</i>, <i>bui</i>, <i>čo</i>, <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> and <i>mino</i> and others. It was <i>Biliku</i> who made the earth (the forest, <i>ti-miku</i>). She began at <i>Čaura</i>."</p>  
 <p>(3) "<i>Biliku</i> lived at <i>Ar-Kol</i> in the time of the ancestors. Her husband was <i>Tarai</i> and their children were the birds, <i>T<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>i</i>, <i>Taka</i>, <i>Čot<u>o</u>t</i>, <i>Poruatoko</i>, <i>Kelil</i>, <i>Mite</i>, <i>Č<u>o</u>pčura</i>, <i>Benye</i>, <i>Biratkoro</i>, <i>Čereo</i>, <i>Milidu</i>, <i>Bobelo</i>, <i>Kolo</i>, and <i>Teo</i>." (<i>Aka-J̌eru</i>.)</p>  
 <p>(4) "<i>Biliku</i> lived at Poroket. She was unmarried. She had a son <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i>, and her other children were <i>T<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>i</i>, <i>Čelene</i>, <i>Čot<u>o</u>t</i> and <i>Čerei</i>. (These four are the names of birds.) It was <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> who invented all the arts of the Andamanese such as their bows and arrows, etc." (<i>Aka-Bo</i>?.)</p>  
 <p>(5) "<i>Biliku</i> used to live at <i>Peč-meo</i> with her husband <i>T<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>i</i> (a bird). She used to eat <i>l<u>o</u>ito</i>, and when anyone else ate that root she was angry. <i>Tarai</i> lived at <i>Čaroŋa</i> with his wife <i>Kelil</i> (a bird). He ate only <i>mikulu</i>." (<i>Aka-K<u>o</u>ra</i>.)</p>  
 <p>(6) "<i>Tarai</i> has very long legs and a short body. He used to live on a small island beyond Interview Island, which is now submerged. When <i>Tarai</i> goes to sleep he breathes very heavily and this makes the wind."</p>  
 <p>The next is an <i>Aka-Kede</i> legend. "In the days of the ancestors <i>Bilika</i> lived at <i>Purum-at-čape</i> in the <i>Aka-Kede</i> country, with her husband <i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>kul</i>. One day <i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>kul</i> was out hunting. He returned with a pig that he had killed and came to the creek on the other side of which was his home (<i>C<u>o</u>ti-t<u>e</u>r-buli Buliu</i>). Laden as he was with the pig he could not swim across the creek. <i>Bilika</i> was sleeping, but her children were playing near and saw their father on the other side of the creek. They ran and told their mother that their father was coming but could not cross the creek. <i>Bilika</i> went and lay down on one bank of the creek and stretched out her leg so that it reached the other bank. <i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>kul</i> walked across her leg and so reached home."</p>  
 <p>While it is clear from this legend that <i>Bilika</i> was of super-human size, the same was also true of her husband, if we may judge from another legend. "<i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>kul</i> made for himself a bow (of the large southern pattern), with which to shoot pig. At</p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>this time the sky was low down near the earth, only just above the tops of the trees. When <i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>kul</i> had finished his bow he lifted it upright. The top of it struck the sky and lifted it up to its present position where it has remained ever since."</p>  
 <p>In another legend from another part of the <i>Aka-Kede</i> tribe <i>Bilika</i> is spoken of as being male. "<i>Bilika</i> lived at <i>P<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>ŋ-et-čo</i> with his wife Mite. They had a child. The ancestors ate <i>Bilika's</i> food, <i>l<u>o</u>ito</i> and <i>kata</i> and other plants. <i>Bilika</i> was very angry. He used to smell their mouths to see if they had eaten his food. When he found a man or woman who had done so he would cut his throat. The ancestors were very angry with <i>Bilika</i>, because he killed the men and women when they ate his foods. They all came together and killed <i>Bilika</i> and his wife <i>Mite</i>. <i>Maia Burto</i> (a species of fish) took the child (of <i>Bilika</i>) away to the north-east."</p>  
 <p>Owing to my lack of knowledge of the <i>Aka-Kede</i> language there are some points of the above legend that remain obscure. I think that the child of <i>Bilika</i> is also named <i>Bilika</i>, and that it is he (or she) who now lives in the north-east and sends the storms. The plants (<i>l<u>o</u>ito</i>, <i>kata</i>, etc.), called here the "food" of <i>Bilika</i>, are those mentioned in the last chapter as specially belonging to <i>Bilika</i>, who is angry when the natives eat them. As regards the name, <i>Mite</i>, of <i>Bilika's</i> wife, I do not know whether this is the name of the bronze-winged dove, or of the cicada. In some of the Andamanese languages the names of these two are very similar, the only difference being a very slight one in the way of pronouncing the two vowels.</p>  
 <p>The <i>A-Pučikwar</i> people who live on the east coast of Baratang Island say that in the beginning the ancestors lived at a place called <i>Wota-emi</i>, and <i>Bilik</i> lived opposite to them across the strait at a place called <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i>. In a rock at <i>Wota-emi</i> there is a large peculiarly shaped hollow. This is said to be where <i>Bilik</i> used to sit when he was on earth.</p>  
 <p>An <i>Akar-Bale</i> legend is as follows. "In the days of the ancestors <i>Puluga</i> lived at <i>J̌ila</i> off the east coast of Henry Lawrence Island and the ancestors lived at <i>Puluga</i> l'od-baraij (the village of <i>Puluga</i>) on the main island just opposite to <i>J̌ila</i>. <i>Puluga</i> was always getting angry with the ancestors,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p>because they dug up yams and ate <i>čakan</i> (<i>Entada scandens</i>) and <i>barata</i> (<i>Caryota sobolifera</i>). When he was angry he used to destroy their huts and property. So the people sent him out of the world, saying 'We do not want you here. You are always angry with us.' <i>Puluga</i> went away to the north-east."</p>  
 <p>It is worth while to note that <i>J̌ila</i> is north-east from <i>Puluga l’od-baraij</i>, just as <i>Tol-l’oko-tima</i> is north-east from <i>Wota-emi</i>. In both cases there is a narrow strait between the place where the ancestors lived and the home of <i>Puluga</i> or <i>Bilik</i>.</p>  
 <p>There are a number of different legends that relate how the ancestors first obtained fire <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a>. In many of these legends there is a reference to <i>Biliku</i> or <i>Puluga</i>. A common statement in the North Andaman is that "Fire was stolen from <i>Biliku</i> by <i>Maia Tiritmo</i> (Sir Kingfisher)." Some of the legends give further details. An <i>Aka-Čari</i> legend is as follows:</p>  
 <p>"<i>Biliku</i> had a red stone and a pearl shell (<i>be</i>). She struck them together and obtained fire. She collected firewood and made a fire. She went to sleep. <i>Mite</i> (the bronze-winged dove) came and stole fire. He made a fire for himself. He gave fire to all the people in the village. Afterwards fire was given to all the places. Each village had its own."</p>  
 <p>The next is an <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> version.</p>  
 <p>"In the days of the ancestors they had no fire. <i>Biliku</i> had fire. While <i>Biliku</i> slept <i>Maia Lirčitmo</i> (Sir Kingfisher) came and stole fire. As he was taking the fire <i>Biliku</i> awoke and saw him. <i>Lirčitmo</i> swallowed the fire. <i>Biliku</i> took a pearl shell (<i>be</i>) and threw it at <i>Lirčitmo</i> and cut off his head. The fire came out (of his neck). The ancestors got the fire. <i>Lirčitmo</i> became a bird."</p>  
 <p>The next is also, I believe, an <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> story. "<i>Maia Tiritmo</i> (Sir Kingfisher) lived at <i>Tolepar Buruin</i>. He had no fire. When he caught fish he had no fire with which to cook it. He went to the place where <i>Č<u>o</u>kčura</i> (heron) lived. There was no fire there. <i>Tiritmo</i> took some rotten wood of the <i>piń</i> </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>tree and hit it on a rock, and thus made fire. He gave fire to <i>Č<u>o</u>kčura</i>. <i>Č<u>o</u>kčura</i> gave fire to <i>Totemo</i> (a species of kingfisher). <i>Totemo</i> gave it to all the others.</p>  
 <p>A slightly different and less detailed version of the same story is as follows:</p>  
 <p>"<i>Tiritmo</i> made fire. <i>Totemo</i> stole fire (from <i>Tiritmo</i>) and gave it to <i>M<u>o</u>ičo</i> (Rail). <i>M<u>o</u>ičo</i> gave fire to all the people."</p>  
 <p>The next version, which was taken down in <i>Aka-J̌eru</i>, I did not fully understand.</p>  
 <p>"Some one shot an arrow. The arrow hit the hill of fire. <i>Tiriń</i> (a species of kingfisher) found the arrow. It was on fire. He took the fire to his camp. He would not give fire to any one. The others asked him. They went to their homes. At night they came to <i>Tiriń</i>'s hut and stole fire. They went away, each to his own place."</p>  
 <p>There is a certain amount of obscurity about two other versions, which are given in a translation as nearly literal as possible. "<i>Maia Dik</i> (Sir Prawn) made fire. Some <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> (yam) leaves caught fire, being dry. <i>Maia Dik</i> made a fire. <i>Maia Dik</i> slept. <i>Maia Totemo</i> (Sir Kingfisher) stole fire and ran away. <i>Maia Totemo</i> made a fire. He cooked fish. When he had eaten, he slept. <i>Maia Mite</i> (Sir Dove) stole fire (from <i>Totemo</i>) and ran away.</p>  
 <p>The other is as follows. "Piribi got fire from a stone. He threw fire at <i>Bilika</i>. It set some <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> (yam) leaves on fire. <i>Č<u>o</u>rolo</i> (Parrot) got fire (from the burning leaves). He gave it to the ancestors."</p>  
 <p>These two legends were taken down in <i>Aka-Čari</i>, but they are perhaps really <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>ra</i> or <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> stories. I have the word <i>piribi</i> in my notes as meaning a storm, but the translation is doubtful.</p>  
 <p>The next is an <i>Aka-Kede</i> version of what is the most widespread of the legends.</p>  
 <p>"The ancestors had no fire. <i>Bilika</i> had fire. The ancestors tried to steal fire from <i>Bilika</i>. <i>Lirtit</i> (Kingfisher) went one night while <i>Bilika</i> was sleeping and stole fire. <i>Bilika</i> awoke and saw him going away with the fire. She threw a pearl shell (<i>ba</i>) at him, which cut off his wings and his tail. <i>Lirtit</i> dived</p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>into the water and swam with the fire to <i>Bet-’ra-kudu</i> and gave it to <i>T<u>e</u>pe</i>. <i>T<u>e</u>pe</i> gave fire to <i>Mite</i> (the bronze-winged dove). <i>Mite</i> gave it to the others <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>An <i>Aka-Kede</i> legend of the origin of the sun may conveniently be given in this place, as it is connected with the possession of fire by <i>Bilika</i>. "<i>Bilika</i> made fire of <i>purum</i> wood. One day, when she was very angry, she started throwing fire about. One large fire-brand she threw into the sky, and there it became the sun." This legend explains the name of the place <i>Purum-at-čape</i>, at which <i>Bilika</i> is said to have lived when on earth. <i>Purum</i> is the name of a tree, not identified; at means either "fire" or "fire-wood," and <i>čape</i> means a village or a hut. The whole word therefore means "<i>Purum</i> fire village."</p>  
 <p>I did not obtain any legend of the origin of fire from the <i>Ok<u>o</u>-J̌uw<u>o</u>i</i> and <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> tribes, but a version from each of these tribes has been given by Mr Portman. A translation of Mr Portman's <i>Ok<u>o</u>-J̌uw<u>o</u>i</i> story is as follows <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">2</font></a>. "<i>M<u>o</u>m Mirit</i> <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">3</font></a> stole a fire-brand from <i>Kuro-t’on-mika</i> while <i>Bilik</i> was sleeping. He gave the brand to the late <i>Leč</i>, who then made fire at <i>Karat-tatak-emi</i>."</p>  
 <p>Mr Portman's <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> story is somewhat obscure. "<i>Bilik</i> was sleeping at <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i>. <i>Luratut</i> (Kingfisher) took away fire to <i>Oko-emi</i>. <i>K<u>o</u>lotat</i> went to <i>Min-t<u>o</u>ŋ-ta</i> (taking with him fire from <i>Oko-emi</i>). At <i>Min-t<u>o</u>ŋ-ta</i> the fire went out. <i>K<u>o</u>lotat</i> broke up the charred firewood and made fire again (by blowing up the embers). They (the people there) became alive. Owing to the fire they became alive. The ancestors (<i>Jaŋil</i>) thus got fire at <i>Min-t<u>o</u>ŋ-ta</i> village."</p>  
 <p>From the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe I only obtained one version of the fire legend. "When the ancestors lived at <i>Wota-emi</i>, <i>Bilik</i> lived at <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i> across the strait. In those days the ancestors had no fire. <i>Bilik</i> took some wood of the tree called <i>p<u>e</u>rat</i> and broke it and made fire for himself. <i>Luratut</i> (Kingfisher) came to <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i> while <i>Bilik</i> was sleeping and stole some fire. <i>Bilik</i> awoke and saw <i>Luratut</i>. He (<i>Bilik</i>) took</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>up a lighted brand and threw it at <i>Luratut</i>. It hit him in the back of the neck and burnt him. <i>Luratut</i> gave the fire to the people at <i>Wota-emi</i>. <i>Bilik</i> was very angry about this and went away to live in the sky."</p>  
 <p>The kingfisher of the story (<i>Alcedo beavani</i>?) has a patch of bright red feathers on its neck. This is where it was burnt by the brand thrown by <i>Bilik</i>.</p>  
 <p>Mr Portman gives a slightly different version from the same tribe <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">1</font></a>. "<i>Bilik</i> was sleeping at <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i>. <i>Luratut</i> went to bring fire. He caught hold of the fire, and in doing so burnt <i>Bilik</i>. <i>Bilik</i> awoke and seized some fire. He hit <i>Luratut</i> with the fire. Then he hit <i>Tarčal</i> (a fish) with the fire. <i>Čalter</i> (another species of kingfisher) caught hold of the fire. He gave it to the ancestors at <i>Wota-emi</i>. The ancestors made fires."</p>  
 <p>From the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe I obtained the following legend: "The people had no fire. <i>Dim-d<u>o</u>ri</i> (a fish) went and fetched fire from <i>J̌ereg-l’ar-mugu</i> (the place of departed spirits). He came back and threw the fire at the people and burnt them, and marked them all. The people ran into the sea and became fishes. <i>Dim-d<u>o</u>ri</i> went to shoot them with his bow and arrows, and he also became a fish." This story is supposed to account for the bright colouring of certain species of fish.</p>  
 <p>Mr Portman gives a somewhat similar version from the same tribe <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <i>Dim-d<u>o</u>ra</i> (a fish), a very long time ago, at <i>Keri-l’oŋ-tower</i>, was bringing fire from <i>Puluga's</i> platform (fire-place). He, taking the fire, burnt everybody with it. <i>Bolub</i> and <i>Tark<u>o</u>r</i> and <i>Biličau</i> fell into the sea and became fishes. They took the fire to <i>Rokwa-l’ar-toŋa</i> village and made fires there."</p>  
 <p>Another <i>Akar-Bale</i> legend is that fire was given to the first ancestors (<i>Da Duku</i> and <i>In Bain</i>) by <i>Puluga</i>. Still another is that fire was obtained by the ancestors from <i>Aga</i>, the skink (<i>Mabuia tytleri</i>). The mist that is often seen hanging over the jungle in small patches, after rain or at dawn, is said to be the smoke of <i>Aga's</i> fire. An island in the Archipelago is called <i>Aga l’od-baraij</i>, <i>Aga's</i> village.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>Mr Portman gives an <i>Aka-Bea</i> legend, which, however, relates that the events took place at <i>Wota-emi</i> in the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> country <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Puluga</i> was asleep at <i>Tol-l’oko-tima</i>. <i>Luratut</i> came, stealing fire. The fire burnt <i>Puluga</i>. <i>Puluga</i> awoke. <i>Puluga</i> seized some fire. Taking the fire he burnt <i>Luratut</i> with it. <i>Luratut</i> took the fire. He burnt <i>Tar-čeker</i> (another kind of kingfisher) with it in <i>Wota-emi</i> village. The ancestors lit fires. They (the ancestors) were the <i>Tomo-la</i>."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man gives three different versions of legends as to the origin of fire. According to the first of these, <i>Puluga</i>, after he had made the first man, <i>Tomo</i>, gave him fire and taught him its use. <i>Puluga</i> obtained fire by stacking in alternate layers two kinds of wood known as <i>c<u>o</u>r</i> and <i>ber</i>, and then bidding the sun to come and sit on or near the pile until she ignited it, after which she returned to her place in the sky <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The second version is that <i>Puluga</i> came to <i>Tomo</i> with a spirit named <i>Lači Puŋa Ablola</i> to instruct <i>Tomo</i>, who at his direction, prepared a pyre and then struck it, on which the fire was kindled and <i>Puŋa Ablola</i> proceeded to teach him how to cook food <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">3</font></a>. This legend contains an obvious contradiction. <i>Lači Puŋa Ablola</i>, as is shown by the name itself (<i>Lači</i> = the late), is the name of some one who is supposed to have lived and died and so become a spirit. Yet at the same time <i>Tomo</i> is supposed to have been the first of the Andamanese. There is the possibility, however, that this inconsistency is due not to the natives themselves, but to Mr Man's transcription. It is possible that the legend is that fire was discovered and was given to the ancestors (the <i>Tomo</i>) by a person who, being dead, is now <i>Lači Puŋa Ablola</i>, but who was then alive and one of the ancestors (<i>Tomo</i>) themselves.</p>  
 <p>A third legend about fire given by Mr Man is associated by him with another legend about a flood that once overwhelmed the ancestors. According to Mr Man's version the fires were all extinguished by the flood, so that the few survivors were left without fire. "At this juncture one of their recently deceased</p>

 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>friends appeared in their midst in the form of a bird named <i>Luratut</i>. Seeing their distress he flew up to <i>M<u>o</u>ro</i>, the sky, where he discovered <i>Puluga</i> seated beside his fire; he thereupon seized and attempted to carry away in his beak a burning log, but the heat, or weight, or both, rendered the task impossible, and the blazing brand fell on <i>Puluga</i>, who, incensed with pain, hurled it at the intruder; happily for those concerned, the missile missed its mark and fell near the very spot where the survivors were deploring their condition. As <i>Luratut</i> alighted in their midst at the same moment, he gained the full credit for having removed the chief cause of their distress <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>We may now consider a group of legends that relate how a great catastrophe overwhelmed the ancestors. In many of the versions the legend relates how the ancestors were transformed into animals. Some of the legends are connected with <i>Biliku</i> or <i>Puluga</i> and others are connected with the first discovery of fire. Beginning with the North Andaman, the following is, I believe, an <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> version. "<i>Mimi Čara</i> once broke some firewood in the evening (while the cicada was singing). A great storm came and killed many people, who were turned into fishes and birds. The water rose up till it covered the trees. <i>Mimi Čara</i> and Mimi Kota took the fire and want up the hill to the cave <i>Ŋaram</i>. They carried the fire under a cooking-pot. They kept the fire alight in the cave, until the storm was over."</p>  
 <p>Another <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> legend was taken down hurriedly and the full details were not obtained. "The people made a noise in the evening when <i>Mite</i> (the cicada) was singing. <i>Mite</i> went to see her mother <i>Biliku</i>. Her mother saw her eyes and face. She looked bad. Her eyes were red (with weeping). <i>Biliku</i> was very angry. There was a big storm and heavy rain. <i>Biliku</i> threw her pearl shells (lightning). She went mad. She destroyed the whole world. <i>Biliku</i> went up to live in the sky. The earth was bare (literally, empty). One day <i>Biliku</i> dropped a <i>Dipterocarpus</i> seed from the sky. Out of this all the different kinds of tree grew, and the earth was again covered with</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>forest." There was more of the legend, which I was unable at the time to understand, and which I did not hear again. My informant added "It was on this occasion that <i>Maia Taolu</i> saved the fire."</p>  
 <p>An <i>Aka-Čari</i> legend relates how the birds and beasts and fishes arose. "<i>Maia Dik</i> (Sir Prawn) once got angry and threw fire at the people (the ancestors). They all turned into birds and fishes. The birds flew into the jungle. The fishes jumped into the sea. <i>Maia Dik</i> <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">1</font></a> himself became a large prawn which is still called by the same name." In connection with this legend it must be remembered that it was <i>Maia Dik</i>, according to one legend, who first discovered the use of fire. One version of the story said that he made fire by striking a piece of <i>paraŋo</i> wood. Then he threw the burning wood about amongst the ancestors and they turned into birds and fishes.</p>  
 <p>An <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> version is very similar. "The people were all asleep. Maia Kolo (Sir Sea-eagle) came and threw fire amongst them. They awoke in a fright and all ran in different directions. Some ran into the sea and became fishes and turtle; others ran into the jungle and became birds."</p>  
 <p>The <i>Aka-Kede</i> version of the catastrophe that overtook the ancestors is as follows. " It was at the place called <i>Čilpet</i>. The people collected a lot of honey. They refused to give any to <i>K<u>o</u>po-tera-wat</i> (a bird, not identified). The latter got very angry, and in the evening, when the cicadae were singing he made a great noise and disturbed their song. Then there arose a great storm, and it rained very heavily, and the sea rose over the land. It rose very rapidly till only the top of a big Dipterocarpus tree showed above the water. The people took refuge in the branches of this tree. <i>Mima Mite</i> (Lady Dove) managed to rescue some fire and keep it alight under a cooking pot. The waters at length subsided. Then the people did not know how to get down from the tree. <i>Mima Čarami-lebek</i> made a long piece of string and with this she lowered the people</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>safely to the ground." The <i>čarami-lebek</i>, which was not identified, is a species of bird that lives, so the natives say, only at the top of the very tallest trees of the forest.</p>  
 <p>An <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> version of the same legend is as follows: "At first there were no birds in the jungle and no fish in the sea. The ancestors were playing one evening and making a noise while the <i>peti</i> (cicada) was singing. Then <i>Bilik</i> got angry and sent a great cyclone. All the people were turned into birds and fishes and turtles and jungle beasts."</p>  
 <p>There is an <i>A-Pučikwar</i> legend that, in the days of the ancestors, there was a big cyclone. There was a flood at <i>Wota-emi</i> and the water rose up over the trees. Some of the ancestors climbed up into a big <i>Dipterocarpus</i> tree and remained there till the waters had subsided. I was not able to hear any more detailed version of the legend.</p>  
 <p>The following legend explaining how the ancestors were turned into animals was told me by an <i>A-Pučikwar</i> man, but it is probably really of <i>Akar-Bale</i> origin.</p>  
 <p>"It was in the days of the ancestors. <i>Ta K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> (Sir Tree-lizard) went over to a big meeting at <i>Teb-ǰuru</i> (in the Archipelago). There was a lot of dancing. <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> decided to give a big dancing party of his own. He invited everybody and they all came to his place. <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> danced a great deal. He began to get wild. All the people were afraid, because he was very strong. They caught hold of him by the arms. <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> got very angry. He threw the people from him. He threw them so violently that some fell in the sea and became fishes and turtle. Others fell on different islands and became birds and animals. No one could hold <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i>. At last <i>Berep</i> (a species of crab) caught hold of his arm and would not let go. And thus <i>Berep</i> stopped him. Before this there had been no birds in the jungles nor any fish in the sea."</p>  
 <p>A more complete version of this story was obtained from the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe. "<i>Da Tigbul</i> (Sir Dugong) took all the people to dance at <i>Kwaičo</i>. <i>In Bain</i> (Lady Civet-cat) told <i>Da Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> (Sir Tree-lizard) that people were coming from <i>Tar-mugu</i> to dance and that <i>Da Karami</i> <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">1</font></a> would quarrel with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>  
 <p>him. <i>Da Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> replied 'Oh! I don't care. I can fight all those people easily enough.' All the people came together for the dance and Karami quarrelled with <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i>. The latter got very angry. The people were afraid. <i>Tigbul</i> (Dugong) caught hold of <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> by the arm. <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> threw him from him with such force that Tigbul fell into the sea and became a dugong. Then <i>Kočurag-boa</i> caught hold of <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> and <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> threw him into the jungle <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> threw all the people into the sea or into the jungle and they became birds and beasts and fishes. No one could hold him. Da <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> went away to <i>Teb-ǰuru</i>. The people told <i>Da Berag</i> (Sir Crab) what had happened at <i>Kwaičo</i> and how no one could hold <i>Da Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i>. <i>Da Berag</i> went after him to <i>Teb-ǰuru</i>. <i>Da Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> had covered himself with <i>k<u>o</u>iob</i> (red paint) <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <i>Da Berag</i> pretended that he wanted some paint to put on his upper lip, saying that he was sick. There was no more red paint in the place, so <i>Da Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> said 'You had better come and take some off me.' <i>Da Berag</i> put his nose to <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l's</i> arm as though to get some paint, and bit deeply into <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l's</i> shoulder. <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> could not get loose, and so he died. The people at <i>Teb-ǰuru</i> attacked <i>Da Berag</i> and beat him. They could not kill him, because his skin was too hard, so they threw him into the sea. When <i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l's</i> mother, <i>Kegŋa</i>, came and found her son dead she was very angry. She wept for a long time. Then she went into the jungle and cut the plant <i>t<u>o</u>kul</i> which belongs to <i>Puluga</i>. <i>Puluga</i> was angry because the <i>t<u>o</u>kul</i> was cut and sent a big storm which killed <i>Kegŋa</i> and all the other people in that place."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man records another version of this legend.</p>  
 <p>"To explain the origin of certain fish, they say that one day before the Deluge, <i>Maia K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> went to visit an encampment of the <i>Tomola</i> situated in the Archipelago. While engaged in his song the women, through inattention to his instructions, marred the effect of the chorus, so, to punish them, he seized</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>his bow, whereupon the whole party in terror fled in all directions; some escaping into the sea were changed into dugongs, porpoises, sharks, and various other fish which till then had not been seen <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man gives still another version of the same story. "One day, at the commencement of the rainy season, a <i>tomola</i> named <i>Berebi</i> came to visit <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t's</i> mother, <i>Čana Erep</i>, with the express intention of seeing her son, of whom he was extremely jealous. When he appeared <i>Berebi</i> treacherously bit him in the arm, but his teeth became fixed in the flesh and he was therefore unable to detach himself from his victim, whose friends promptly avenged his murder, and disposed of the corpses by throwing them into the sea. (<i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i>, after death, was transformed into a species of tree-lizard, which is still named after him, and <i>Berebi</i> became a fish called <i>Koŋo</i>, which is armed with a row of poisonous barbs in its back.) The bereaved mother, in her rage, grief and despair, committed various acts, against which <i>Tomo</i> had been warned by <i>Puluga</i>, and while so doing incited others to follow her example by the following words:</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>e, e, e, dia ra-gumul l’ab-dala,<br> e, e, e, ŋul kaǰa piǰ pugatken,<br> e, e, e, ŋul čoaken toaiken,<br> e, e, e, ŋul boarato aga-kolaken,<br> e, e, e, ŋul gono boaŋken,<br> e, e, e, ŋul toŋ čoara boaŋken,<br> e, e, e, ŋig arlot pulaiǰoken</i>.</font></dir>  
 <p>The translation of which is:</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">e, e, e (sobbing)--My grown-up handsome son,<br>     "        "            Burn the wax,<br>     "        "            Grind the seed of the <i>čakan</i> (Entada),<br>     "        "            Destroy the <i>barata</i> (<i>Caryota</i>),<br>     "        "            Dig up the <i>gono</i> (yam),<br>     "        "            Dig up the <i>čati</i> (yam),<br>     "        "            Destroy everything."</font></dir>  
 <p>Thereupon Pu<i>luga</i> was exceeding wroth, and sent the flood, that which destroyed all living things with the exception of two men and two women.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>"This tradition is preserved in the following lines:</p>  
 <p></p><dir><dir><font size="-1"><i>Keledoat ibaji lar čora,<br> Ra gumul ab-gorga en ig-boadi<br> Ra gumul be liga koarna<br> Ra gumul ab-gorka<br> Toala arbo eb dagan čoarpo</i>.</font></dir></dir>  
 <p>The meaning of which is:</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Bring the boat to the beach<br> I will see your fine grown-up son,<br> The grown-up son who threw the youths (into the sea)<br> The fine grown-up son,<br> My adze is rusty, I will stain my lips with his blood.</font></dir>  
 <p>In this, as in all their songs and chants, a good deal is left to the imagination, but from their explanations which have been given by the aborigines, the following appear to afford some light on the subject:--<i>Berebi</i>, being jealous of the renown <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> had won for himself by his numerous accomplishments and great strength, took advantage of meeting him and his mother one day on the water to ask them to let him enter their boat. On their complying with his request, he provided himself with a rusty adze and hone, remarking on the rusty condition of the former; then taking <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> by the arm he sniffed it from the wrist to the shoulder as if admiring the development of the muscles; while doing so he muttered the threat of staining his lips with blood, which he shortly after fulfilled in the manner already described <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>As the songs given in this legend are in the <i>Akar-Bale</i> language (Southern dialect), it is probable that the legend is an <i>Akar-Bale</i> one. It is really another version of the legend already given.</p>  
 <p>Another <i>Akar-Bale</i> story tells how the first ancestors <i>Duku</i>, the monitor lizard, and <i>Bain</i> the civet-cat, managed to keep the fire alight when a flood overwhelmed them. "One day in the time of the ancestors there came a great storm, and the water rose over the land. The rain put out the fires. <i>Da Duku</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard) took a smouldering log and tried to climb up a tree with it. He could not climb with the fire in his hand. His wife <i>In Bain</i> (Lady Civet-cat) took the fire from him and took it</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p>up to the top of a hill and there kept it alight till the rain stopped and the water went away. The hill is called <i>Bain l’it-čapa</i> (Bain's fire) to the present day." The hill is a rather steep-sided hill of no great height in Havelock Island.</p>  
 <p>Mr Portman <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a> connects the story of the flood with the story of the dispersion of the ancestors over the islands. Referring to the names of the tribes he says, "The Andamanese state that these names were given to the different tribes by <i>Maia Tomo-la</i> when they were dispersed after a cataclysm. They have a tradition that this group of tribes was once all one tribe, and that the Andaman Islands were much larger than at present. Some great cataclysm occurred during which part of the islands subsided and many aborigines were drowned, the remainder being separated into different territories as at present by the orders of <i>Maia Tomo-la</i>, apparently the chief at that time of the collected tribe. (The above is of course a matter-of-fact version of the fanciful and impossible legends of the Andamanese.)"</p>  
 <p>The dispersion legend in the South Andaman is connected with the name of the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe. The name (of which the <i>Aka-Bea</i> equivalent is <i>Aka-Boǰig-yab</i>) means "those who talk the original language," it being believed that the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> language was the one originally spoken by the ancestors.</p>  
 <p>The only version of the dispersion legend that I heard was from the <i>Aka-Kede</i> tribe. It was to the effect that <i>Bilika</i> once seized all the ancestors and put them in a netted bag (such as the natives use for carrying small objects of various kinds). She (or he) took them out a few at a time and put them in different parts of the country, where their descendants have been ever since.</p>  
 <p>Mr Man speaks of a legend of how the tribes came to be dispersed over the islands. From his account it would seem that there were two different dispersions, one before the Deluge, and a second after it. Mr Man's account is as follows. "<i>Tomo</i> lived to a great age, but even before his death his offspring became so numerous that their home could no longer accommodate them. At <i>Puluga's</i> bidding they were furnished with all necessary weapons, implements, and fire, and then scattered in</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>pairs all over the country. When this exodus occurred <i>Puluga</i> provided each party with a distinct dialect. It would almost seem that, without straining the legend to suit facts, we might discern in this a faint echo of the Biblical account of the confusion of tongues and dispersion at Babel <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>"Consequent on the disappearance of <i>Tomo</i> and his wife, the duties of headship over the community at <i>Wota-emi</i> devolved on one of their grandchildren, named <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i>, who was distinguished by being the first to spear and catch turtles. The <i>tomola</i> remained on the islands long after <i>Tomo's</i> transformation, but after <i>K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t's</i> death, according to one legend, they grew disobedient, and as <i>Puluga</i> ceased to visit them, became more and more remiss in their observance of the commands given at the creation. At last <i>Puluga's</i> anger burst forth, and, without any warning, he sent a great flood that covered the whole land, and destroyed all living. Four persons (two men, <i>L<u>o</u>ra-lola</i> and <i>P<u>o</u>i-lola</i>, and two women, <i>Ka-lola</i> and <i>Rima-lola</i>), who happened to be in a canoe when the catastrophe occurred, were able to effect an escape. When the waters subsided, they found themselves near <i>Wota-emi</i>, where they landed and discovered that every living thing on earth had perished; but <i>Puluga</i> re-created the animals, birds, etc. <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>"When, for the second time in their history, their numbers had increased to so great an extent that it became impossible for them to remain together in one spot, an exodus, similar to the first, took place; each party being furnished with fire and every other essential, started in a different direction, and on settling down adopted a new and distinct dialect. They each received a tribal name, and from them have sprung the various tribes still existing on the islands <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">3</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>In the Southern tribes there is a legend to account for the origin of night. The following version was obtained from the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe. "In the early days of the world, in the time of the ancestors, there was no night; it was always day. <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard) went into the jungle to dig up yams. He found some yams. He also found some resin (<i>teki</i>), and a cicada (<i>r<u>o</u>to</i>). He brought them to the camp of the ancestors at</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>Wota-emi</i>. He sat down and the people came round him. <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> took the cicada and rubbed it between his hands and crushed it. As he did this the cicada uttered its cry. Then the day went away and it was dark. It remained dark for several days. The ancestors came together and tried to get back the day. They made torches of resin, and danced and sang songs. First <i>Kotare</i> (a bird) sang a song, but he could not get back the daylight. Then <i>Bumu</i> (a beetle?) sang, but the day would not come. Then <i>Pecer<u>o</u>l</i> (the bulbul, <i>Otocompsia emeria</i>) sang, and after him <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> (a bird), but both in vain. Then <i>K<u>o</u>ŋoro</i> (a species of ant) sang a song and morning came. After that, day and night followed one another alternately."</p>  
 <p>A similar legend was obtained from the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe. "<i>Da Teŋat</i> <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a> lived at <i>Golugma Bud</i>. He went fishing one day and got only one small fish of the kind called <i>čelau</i> (<i>Glyphidodon sordidus</i>?): He turned to go home, and as he went he shot his arrows before him into the jungle <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then he went after his arrows to find them again. As he went he spoke to the fruits of the jungle, asking them their names. In those days the ancestors did not know the names of the fruits and trees. First he asked the <i>puiam</i>, and then the <i>guluba</i>, and then the <i>čakli</i>, but none of them replied to him. Then he found his first arrow. It was stuck fast in a big yam (<i>gono</i>). He took the arrow and said to the yam 'What is your name?' At first the yam did not answer. <i>Teŋat</i> turned to go away. He had gone a few steps when the yam called him back, saying 'My name is <i>gono</i>.' <i>Teŋat</i> replied 'Oh! I did not know. Why did not you say so before?' He dug up the yam, which was a very big one. He went off to look for his second arrow. As he went he spoke to the stones of the jungle, asking their names, but none of them replied. Then he found his second arrow fixed in a large lump of resin (<i>tug</i>) <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He took the arrow, and as he was going away</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>the resin called him back, saying 'Here! my name is <i>tug</i>; you can take me along with you.' So <i>Teŋat</i> took the resin. Then <i>Teŋat</i> found a cicada (<i>rita</i>), and he took that also. When <i>Teŋat</i> got to the hut (<i>bud</i>), everyone came to look at the things he had brought. He showed them the yam. He told them its name and showed them how to cook it. This was the first time that the ancestors ate <i>gono</i>. Then <i>Teŋat</i> took in his hand the cicada and squashed it between his palms. As he killed it the cicada uttered its cry and the whole world became dark. When the people saw that it was dark they tried to bring back the daylight. <i>Teŋat</i> took some of the resin and made torches. He taught the people how to dance and sing. When <i>Da K<u>o</u>ŋoro</i> (Sir Ant) sang a song the day came back. After that the day and night came alternately."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man records a different version of this story.</p>  
 <p>"The manner in which the world was illuminated at the beginning is not clearly to be ascertained from theft legends, for one story states that the sun and moon were subsequently created at Tome's request, as he found that, under the then existing circumstances, it was impossible to catch fish by night or to hunt by day; while, in direct disagreement with this, another story tells us that night was a punishment brought upon mankind by certain individuals who angered <i>Puluga</i> by killing a caterpillar. The tale informs us that the sun, one day, burned so fiercely as to cause great distress. Two women named <i>Čana Limi</i> and <i>Čana J̌araŋud</i>, became exceedingly irritable, and while in this unhappy frame of mind they discovered a caterpillar (<i>gurug</i>) and a certain plant called <i>utura</i>. By way of venting their spleen, one crushed the helpless grub, and the other destroyed the plant. These wanton acts so displeased <i>Puluga</i> that he determined to punish them, and to teach them to appreciate the privilege of daylight, which they had hitherto uninterruptedly enjoyed. He accordingly visited the earth with a long-continued darkness, which caused every one much inconvenience and distress. At last their chief, <i>Maia K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i>, to whom reference has already been made, hit upon a happy expedient of inducing <i>Puluga</i> to restore the former state of things by trying to assure him that they were quite unconcerned, and could enjoy</p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>themselves in spite of light being withheld from them. To accomplish this, he invented the custom of dancing and singing, the result of which was that <i>Puluga</i>, finding that they had frustrated his intention, granted, as a first concession alternate periods of day and night, and subsequently, moved by the difficulties often occasioned by the latter, created the moon to mitigate their troubles. It is in this way that they account for the same word being used to denote a caterpillar and night <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>From the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe I obtained a legend about the origin of death. No other version of the same legend was obtained.</p>  
 <p>"At <i>J̌<u>o</u>ŋo-l’ar-b<u>o</u>ŋ</i> lived <i>In Kalwadi</i> with her sons <i>Yaramurud</i> and <i>Toau</i> <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <i>Yaramurud</i> went to hunt pig for his mother, but was unsuccessful. When he came home his mother brought him some pork that was in the hut. As he took his knife from the back of his neck to cut the meat with it, he cut himself <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Then his mother knew that he was dead. She said to him 'You are dead now. You had better go away. We do not want you here any more.' She took him up and carried him into the jungle and buried him, returning home. Very soon <i>Yaramurud</i> returned. His mother exclaimed 'Oh! I thought you had gone.' He replied 'Mother, I did not die. Why did you bury me?' But she knew he was dead, so she took him and buried him again. He came back again. This happened three times. Then <i>Kalwadi</i> took him into the jungle to a big <i>dumla</i> tree (<i>Pisonia excelsa</i>), in which there was a big hole. She kicked the tree with her foot and said 'You go in there.' <i>Yaramurud</i> went inside. 'Well! Have you gone?' his mother asked. He answered 'Yes!' 'Tell me how the spirits (<i>čauga</i>) talk' she asked him, and he replied '<i>T<u>o</u> kit</i> <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' Then his mother knew that he was with the spirits, and said 'Oh! my child, you are</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p>finished now. You will never come back again.' After a few days <i>Yaramurud</i> came back (as a spirit) to see his brother <i>Toau</i>. <i>Toau</i> was busy building a hut. When <i>Yaramurud</i> saw him he killed him. Before this there had been no death. But <i>In Kalwadi</i> told the people, saying 'You see what has happened; well, we shall all of us die like this, like these two have done'."</p>  
 <p>There is a widespread legend to account for the origin of creeks and islands. The following is an <i>A-Pučikwar</i> version.</p>  
 <p>"At first there was only one big island with the sea all round it. There were no small islands and no creeks. <i>Koŋoro</i> (a species of ant) made a turtle net and went fishing. He caught a very big fish of the kind called <i>k<u>o</u>ro-ŋiti-čau</i> in his net, and dived down and attached a rope to its tail. The fish got very angry and made furious plunges to get away, striking the land in its struggles, and each time knocking off a bit of the land or making a long split. This is the origin of the smaller islands and the creeks."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man records the same legend, but says it was <i>Tomo</i> who caught the fish <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a>. In an <i>Akar-Bale</i> version it was <i>Da Pečer<u>o</u>l</i> who caught the fish (<i>k<u>o</u>roŋadi</i>). <i>Pečer<u>o</u>l</i> is the bulbul (<i>Otocompsia emeria</i>). I have the name <i>k<u>o</u>roŋadi</i> in my notes as being <i>Sphyraena acutipinnis</i>, but the identification is a doubtful one. In the <i>Aka-Kede</i> tribe there is a version in which it is stated that one of the ancestors captured a fish called <i>talepo</i>. This does not seem to be the same species of fish as that called <i>koro-ŋiti-čau</i> or <i>k<u>o</u>roŋadi</i> in the South. In the North Andaman the legend is that <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i>, the son of <i>Biliku</i>, shot a large eel (<i>bol</i>) with an arrow, and in its endeavours to get free from the arrow the eel wriggled about till it made all the creeks.</p>  
 <p>In the Southern tribes there is a legend that relates how the pig first got its senses. A version from the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe is as follows.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Ta Mita</i> (Sir Dove) went into the jungle and found a lot of pigs. They did not run away when he came because they had no eyes to see him, no ears to hear, and no nostrils with which to smell. They had no mouths. <i>Mita</i> made mouths for them and gave them tusks which he made of <i>tobur</i> wood. He made</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>eyes and ears and nostrils in their heads and taught them how to grunt and how to sneeze <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>Another version from the same tribe is as follows.</p>  
 <p>"At first the pigs had neither nose nor ears nor eyes. They used to stand about at <i>Wota-emi</i> when the ancestors lived there. The people ate a great many of them. They were such a nuisance that <i>Mita</i> (Dove), the wife of <i>Tomo</i>, thought of a plan to get them out of the way. She bored holes in their heads, two for eyes, two for ears, and two for nostrils. The pigs ran off into the forest where they have been ever since."</p>  
 <p>I did not obtain any version of this legend from the Northern tribes. The <i>Aka-Kede</i> have a different legend about the pigs.</p>  
 <p>"At first there were no pigs. One of the ancestors, <i>Mimi Čau</i> (Lady Civet-cat), invented a new game, and made the ancestors run on all fours and grunt. Those playing were turned into pigs, and went to live in the jungle. <i>Mimi Čau</i> became a civet-cat (<i>čau</i>)."</p>  
 <p>In the North Andaman there is a legend connected with the pig which explains the origin of the dugong.</p>  
 <p>"<i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> was the first man to catch a pig. He went into the forest and found a pig. <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> was hungry. He caught the pig and took it home. The pig had no eyes nor ears nor mouth. <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> did not disembowel the pig, nor did he sever the joints of its legs <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He made a fire and put the pig on it. The pig swelled up in the heat of the fire and burst. This made holes in the pig's head, two for ears, two for eyes, two for nostrils. The pig perceived that it was being burnt. It jumped up from the fire and ran away. <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> threw a <i>kobo</i> (<i>Licuala</i>) leaf at it. The pig ran into the sea and became a dugong. The leaf became its flipper."</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Aka-Čari</i> tribe there is a legend describing the origin of turtles.</p>  
 <p>"At first there was only one big turtle. He came to the camp of the <i>Aka-Čari</i> people and called them, saying 'Bring your canoes and catch me.' They got into their canoes and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>followed the turtle. They could not catch him. The turtle swam away and the canoes followed. When the canoes were far from land the big turtle came and upset the canoes. The men were all turned into turtles of the same kind and size as those that are seen now. The canoes (and the big turtle?) were turned into a reef."</p>  
 <p>In the South Andaman it is supposed that the custom of scarifying the skin was invented by the first ancestor of the Andamanese, the monitor lizard. An <i>Akar-Bale</i> version of the story is as follows.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Duku</i> (Monitor Lizard) lived with his wife <i>Bain</i> (Civet-cat). <i>Duku</i> said 'I am going to scarify myself' His wife tried to dissuade him. He would not listen to her. He went into the jungle and found a piece of <i>t<u>o</u>lma</i> (quartz) and scarified himself all over. His wife was very angry and asked him why he had done it. <i>Duku</i> replied 'I look very well like this, and you will see, all the other people will do the same'."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man gives a version of the same legend.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Maia Duku</i>, who appears to be identical with <i>Tomo</i>, is said to have been the first to tattoo himself. One day, while out on a fishing expedition, he shot an arrow; missing its object it struck a hard substance which proved to be a piece of iron, the first ever found. With it <i>Duku</i> made an arrow-head and tattooed himself, after which he sang the ditty:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>Toŋ ma lir pireŋa? t<u>o</u>ŋ yitiken! t<u>o</u>ŋ yitiken!<br> t<u>o</u>ŋ ma pireŋa? t<u>o</u>ŋ yitiken</i>!</font></dir>  
 <p>the interpretation of which is</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">'What can now strike me?<br> I am tattooed, I am tattooed!' etc. (Da capo) <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</font></dir>  
 <p>It would seem that Mr Man, or else his informant, was not very clear about the details of the legend. In the South Andaman scarification is never performed with an arrow-head, nor with any instrument of iron, but with a flake of quartz or glass. It is only in the North and Middle Andaman that an arrow-head is used for such a purpose, and even then it is only so used to make the big scars on the back and chest, the ordinary scarification</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>being performed with a flake of stone or glass. The legend is certainly a Southern one, and the song given is in the <i>Aka-Bea</i> language. The accuracy of the transcription of the legend therefore seems very doubtful.</p>  
 <p>Yams and honey, being two of the most important foods of the Andaman Islanders, are the subject of several legends. A common belief about yams is that they were made, or their qualities were first discovered, by <i>Biliku</i> or <i>Puluga</i>. We have already seen that there is a special connection between <i>Biliku</i> (or <i>Puluga</i>) and the yams and other edible roots. There are also other legends, however, on the same subject. An account of the first discovery of the yam called gono is contained in the <i>Akar-Bale</i> legend of the origin of night, already given <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In the North Andaman the following tale is told about the discovery of one kind of yam.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Maia Dik</i> (Sir Prawn) discovered <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> (<i>Dioscorea</i> sp.). He was very hungry and went to look for something to eat. He found a very large <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i>. There was only one <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i>. He cooked it in the fire and ate as much as he could. He dashed the remainder on a rock, and the fragments scattered everywhere and grew into fresh plants. After this there were plenty of <i>k<u>o</u>nmo</i> everywhere."</p>  
 <p>A legend is also told in the North Andaman about the first discovery of another kind of yam.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Maia Pulimu</i> (Sir Fly) and <i>Maia M<u>o</u>ičo</i> (Sir Rail) went to hunt pig. They killed one pig. There was nothing to tie up the pig (to carry it home). <i>Maia Pulimu</i> went to look for a creeper (with which to tie up the pig). He caught hold of a creeper and pulled it and found it was a <i>mino</i> (<i>Dioscorea</i> sp.). <i>Maia Pulimu</i> was a long time away. <i>Maia M<u>o</u>ičo</i> went and found some creeper for himself and tied up the pig and carried it home. When <i>Maia Pulimu</i> came back he found that <i>Maia M<u>o</u>ičo</i> had gone and taken the pig. He followed him and went home. He showed the ancestors how to cook and eat <i>mino</i>."</p>  
 <p>I believe that there is a fuller version of this legend, which I was unable, however, to obtain. Another of my informants told me the story as follows.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>"<i>Mimi M<u>o</u>ičo</i> (Lady Rail) had a son <i>Pulimu</i> (Fly). <i>Pulimu</i> found a <i>mino</i> in the forest and brought it to his mother. They roasted it in the fire."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man gives a story from the South Andaman.</p>  
 <p>"Another of their antediluvian ancestors was famous for propagating yams. This was <i>Maia Bumroag</i>, who in shooting an arrow, struck the creeper belonging to the favourite variety called <i>gono</i>; his curiosity being excited he dug up the root, and tasted it: the result being satisfactory, he informed his friends of his discovery, and they all feasted upon it; when they had had sufficient, he scattered the remains in different directions; this apparent waste so angered his mother that, on pretence of shaving him, she split his head open with a flint. After his death it was found that the act for which he had suffered had tended to the spread of the plant which is now plentiful <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>In the North Andaman it is supposed that honey was discovered by <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> the son of <i>Biliku</i>.</p>  
 <p>"<i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> was the first to eat honey. One day he went to shoot fish. He saw a <i>nyuri</i> (<i>Plotosus</i> sp.). The <i>nyuri</i> disappeared amongst the roots of the mangrove trees. <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> was looking for the fish. There was a honeycomb in a mangrove tree. <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> saw its reflection in the water. He took some fire and tried to get the honey out of the water <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The water put out the fire. He could not get the honey. He went home and told his mother what he had been doing. She went with him and saw the honey. 'What a fool you are' she said, 'don't you see that it is in the trees.' <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> took some fire and smoked out the bees and took the honey. After that <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> used to go and collect honey. He ate it all himself. He did not tell the others (the ancestors) about it. <i>Maia P<u>o</u>rubi</i> (Sir Frog) found out that <i>P<u>e</u>rǰido</i> was getting honey and eating it. He went in to the forest to look for some. He found five or six combs. He ate them all and brought none home to his children. <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> (a smaller species of frog) was the child of <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i>. One day <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> said to his father 'Bring us some honey.' The children went with their father and showed him the combs in the trees.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i> went up the tree, and each time he ate the honey in the tree and did not bring any of it down for his children. Then <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> saw another honeycomb in a very tall tree. He pointed it out to his father. <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i> went up to get it. <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> cut the creeper up which his father had climbed <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a>. <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i> wrapped up the honeycomb to bring it down. <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> said 'Father, this creeper is bad. How will you come down?' <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i> replied 'How can it be bad, when I have just climbed up it?' <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> made some sharp stakes of cone (Areca) wood, and put them round the tree. <i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i> jumped (or fell) from the tree on to the stakes and was killed. <i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i> took the honey and ran away home."</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Aka-Čari</i> tribe there is another legend connected with the frog (<i>p<u>o</u>rubi</i>) which may conveniently be given here.</p>  
 <p>"The ancestors were at enmity with <i>Maia P<u>o</u>rubi</i>. They went to kill him. They shot him with their arrows, but they could not kill him. <i>Maia P<u>o</u>rubi</i> caught hold of them all in his arms, and jumped into the sea. He jumped from the hill called <i>Čauanara</i>. He found a big round stone (boulder) and put the people under it and left them there. All the people turned into stone, and may be seen there now. The next night some more of the people went to hunt turtle near <i>Maia P<u>o</u>rubi's</i> place. They caught a turtle and shouted <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <i>Maia P<u>o</u>rubi</i> heard them shouting. 'They are coming again to kill me,' he said. While they were catching turtle he threw a round stone at them. The stone sank the canoe. The canoe and the people in it were turned to stone."</p>  
 <p>A story in which there is a connection between honey and a toad is given by Mr Man.</p>  
 <p>"Another curious fable is told to account for a drought from which their early ancestors suffered: it relates that once upon a time, in the dry season, a woodpecker discovered a black honey-comb in the hollow of a tree; while regaling himself on this dainty he observed a toad eyeing him wistfully from below, so he invited him to join in the feast; the toad gladly accepted, whereupon the woodpecker lowered a creeper, giving instructions to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>his guest to fasten his bucket (<i>dakar</i>) thereto, and then to seat himself in it, so that he might be drawn up. The toad complied with the directions and the woodpecker proceeded to haul him up; but just when he had brought him near the comb he mischievously let go the creeper, and his confiding and expectant guest experienced an unpleasant fall. The trick so exasperated him that he at once repaired to the streams far and near in the island and drained them, the result of which was that great distress was occasioned to all the birds, as well as to the rest of the animate creation. The success of his revenge so delighted the toad that, to show his satisfaction, and to add to the annoyance of his enemies, he thoughtlessly began to dance, whereupon all the water flowed from him, and the drought soon terminated <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>One of the incidents of the North Andaman story of the frog (<i>P<u>o</u>rubi</i>) and his son (<i>B<u>e</u>r<u>e</u>t</i>) appears in a different story from the South and Middle Andaman. The following is an <i>Aka-K<u>o</u>l</i> version of this legend.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Ta Mita</i> (Sir Dove) and <i>Ta K<u>o</u>io</i> (a species of small bird) went hunting together and got a great number of pigs. <i>Ta K<u>o</u>io</i> told <i>Ta Mita</i> to get some canes to tie up all the pigs. As soon as <i>Ta Mita</i> had gone to look for the cane, <i>Ta K<u>o</u>io</i> went up a big Dipterocarpus tree, taking half the pigs with him. He came down and took the rest of the pigs. He stayed up in the tree with the pigs. When <i>Ta Mita</i> came back he found that the pigs had disappeared. He was very angry and went home. As there was nothing to eat, <i>Mita</i> and his two children, <i>Čada</i> and <i>Čoda</i> (two species of fish) went fishing. <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> was still up the tree. He was cooking the pigs up there. <i>Mita</i> and his children passed under the tree and some burning resin <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">2</font></a> fell on them. In this way they discovered that <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> was in the tree. <i>Mita</i> planned to punish <i>K<u>o</u>io</i>. He cut a great number of sharp stakes of Areca wood and fixed them all round the tree, pointing upwards. <i>K<u>o</u>io</i> was asleep. Mita made the tree sink into the ground. As soon as it was low enough he took some water and threw it into the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>ear of the sleeping <i>K<u>o</u>io</i>, who awoke in a fright and jumped from the tree. He was impaled on the stakes of wood and so died."</p>  
 <p>Another version of the same tale was obtained from the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Da Bumu</i> (a species of bird) went hunting pig with <i>Da Berakwe</i> (another species of bird), and they got a large number of pigs. Then <i>Berakwe</i> said to <i>Bumu</i> 'We want some cane to tie up all these pigs. You go and get it.' When <i>Bumu</i> had gone <i>Berakwe</i> climbed up into a big <i>Dipterocarpus</i> tree, taking all the pigs with him, except one very small one which he left behind. When <i>Bumu</i> came back with the cane he found only one small pig, and he was very angry. He went home with the pig. <i>Bumu's</i> wife <i>Yakoŋ</i> (a species of fish) said 'I am very hungry. We will go and get some fish by night.' At night <i>Yakoŋ</i> went out to get some fish and she passed under the tree where <i>Berakwe</i> was cooking his pigs. Some burning resin fell on her and burnt her. She looked up and saw <i>Berakwe</i> and said 'Oh! there you are; you stole all my husband's pigs.' She went home and told <i>Bumu</i>. In the morning <i>Bumu</i> got up very early and cut a number of pointed stakes of <i>Areca</i> (<i>čam</i>) wood, and fixed them all round the tree where <i>Berakwe</i> was, with the sharp points upwards. Then <i>Bumu</i> made the tree sink gradually into the ground. <i>Berakwe</i> fell from the tree on to the stakes and so was killed. <i>Bumu</i> and his wife got the pigs."</p>  
 <p>Mr Man records a version of the same story.</p>  
 <p>"The legend regarding the origin of the evil spirits known as <i>Č<u>o</u>l</i> is as follows:--Their ancestor, <i>Maia Č<u>o</u>l</i>, one day stole a pig which had been captured by <i>Maia K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i>, and climbed up into a gurjon-tree with his prize. Now <i>Maia K<u>o</u>lw<u>o</u>t</i> was remarkable for his great strength, and being enraged, determined to revenge himself; he thereupon planted a number of spikes all round the tree in which the thief had taken refuge, and then proceeded to force it into the ground. On finding that if he remained where he was, he must inevitably be buried alive, <i>Maia Č<u>o</u>l</i> sprang off the tree, and thereby met a more terrible fate, for he was impaled on the spikes, and perished miserably. His disembodied spirit did not pass to <i>Čaitan</i> (Hades), but took up its abode on the invisible bridge, where, by <i>Puluga's</i> orders, numbers of his</p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>descendants were sent to join him, in the form of black birds with long tails <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>In reference to this version it may be noted that the Col are not "spirits" if that word is used to translate the native term <i>čauga</i> or <i>lau</i>. <i>Č<u>o</u>l</i> is the name of a species of bird, which I believe is the racket-tailed drongo. These birds, though according to Mr Man they live on the rainbow, are to be seen every day in the jungle, and may be heard calling <i>č<u>o</u>l</i>! <i>č<u>o</u>l</i>! <i>č<u>o</u>l</i>!</p>  
 <p>Throughout the Great Andaman there is a belief in a huge animal that haunts the jungles, or that haunted them in the days of the ancestors. In the North Andaman this beast is called <i>J̌irmu</i>. In the days of the ancestors it is supposed to have lived at <i>Ulibi-taŋ</i>, where it attacked and killed any men and women who came in its way. No detailed legend about the <i>J̌irmu</i> was obtained.</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Akar-Bale</i> language <i>Kočurag-boa</i> is the name of the same or a similar monster. In the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> language it is called <i>Uču</i>. This is the name applied to two rocks of limestone which are situated about two or three miles south of <i>Wota-emi</i>, one being in a mangrove swamp, and the other some little way out in the sea. The following legend is told about these rocks.</p>  
 <p>"In the early days of the Andamanese, <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> (Sir Monitor Lizard), the first ancestor, went into the jungle and found a <i>č<u>o</u>ti</i> tree, up which he climbed to eat the fruit. The other people (who lived with him at <i>Wota-emi</i>) came and found him, and <i>Ta P<u>e</u>tie</i> threw down some of the fruit to them, which they ate. The people began to bully <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> to make him throw down more of the fruit. <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> got angry and said 'If you bully me like that I will call the <i>Uču</i>, and they will kill you all.' The people only laughed at him. <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> called the <i>Uču</i>, calling '<i>Dire</i>! <i>dire</i>!' The <i>Uču</i> came, one male and one female. They caught all the people and ate them. Only <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> they did not eat because he was up in the high tree. The <i>Uču</i> went off to cross the strait to <i>T<u>o</u>l-l’oko-tima</i>. They had eaten so much that they were very heavy and stuck in the sand and mud at the edge of the man-grove swamp. When <i>P<u>e</u>tie</i> came down from the tree he found all the people gone. He said 'Hallo! the <i>Uču</i> must have eaten</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>them all.' He went to look. He found the <i>Uču</i> stuck fast at the edge of the mangrove swamp, so that they could not move. He cut open their bellies and all the people came out, for the <i>Uču</i> had swallowed them whole. The <i>Uču</i> are there to this day."</p>  
 <p>When elephants were first introduced into the Andamans for the use of the Forest Department, they were named <i>Uču</i> by the natives, and have ever since retained that name. Similarly the natives of the Northern tribes call them <i>J̌irmu</i>.</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe there is a legend to account for the origin of a rock standing in the sea at a place called <i>Kwaičo-bur</i>.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Ra-gumul Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> went fishing with his bow and arrows in the sea. His bow and arrows and he himself were turned into stone, and may be seen there to the present day."</p>  
 <p><i>Kw<u>o</u>k<u>o</u>l</i> is the common tree-lizard. <i>Ra-gumul</i> is the term applied to a youth or girl who has just passed through the pig-eating ceremony described in Chap. II. A youth is not permitted to handle a bow for some days after the ceremony in question. A version of the same legend is recorded by Mr Man.</p>  
 <p>"The story regarding certain Tomola who failed to observe the rules for neophytes, states that, on the day after they broke their fast of <i>reg-ǰiri</i> (kidney-fat of pig), they left the encampment without giving notice of their intention to their friends, and the result was that, when they were missed and searched for, it was found that they had gone to the shore to fish, and had there met a sad fate; the body of one was discovered adhering to a large boulder, and turned into stone, while the other, likewise in a state of petrifaction, was standing erect beside it <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>A reef on the east side of Ritchie's Archipelago is said to have originated as follows.</p>  
 <p>"The people of <i>Kwaičo</i> went to <i>J̌ila</i> to hunt turtle, taking two canoes. While they were away their wives made up a big fire in the evening at <i>Kwaičo</i>. The hunters and their canoes were turned to stone, and formed the reefs that are now there."</p>  
 <p>I believe that the explanation of this story is the belief that the moon is angry when a bright fire is visible at the time when he rises in the evening shortly after sunset <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p>There seems to be a legend relating to a large snake called <i><u>o</u>r-čubi</i> in the North Andaman, but I was not able to obtain a detailed version. The following was told me in <i>Aka-J̌eru</i>.</p>  
 <p>"At <i>Dalamio</i>, in the time of the ancestors, there used to be a big snake of the kind called <i><u>o</u>r-čubi</i>. He used to catch men and women when they were gathering honey, and kill them and eat them."</p>  
 <p>An <i>Akar-Bale</i> version is a little fuller.</p>  
 <p>"There was a man named <i>Biča</i> who went to look for honey in the jungle. He saw a big snake (<i>wara-ǰobo</i>) and from its neck was hanging a honeycomb. The snake was as big as a tree. 'Why don't you make your honey in the trees?' <i>Biča</i> said to the bees. He went home and called several of the men. They took their bows and arrows. They found the snake, and shot it with a great many arrows. They could not kill the snake, which ran away and was never seen again."</p>  
 <p>An <i>Akar-Bale</i> story relates how the first murder came to pass.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Da Ko</i> (Sir Crow) was the first of the Andamanese. He lived at <i>Kared-čar-buaro</i> with his wife <i>In Mud</i> (Lady Dove). He had a friend, <i>Badgi-beria</i> (Hawk). <i>Badgi-beria</i> had no wife and was jealous of <i>Da Ko</i> and wanted to get his wife. When <i>Da Ko</i> knew this he was very angry. He went into the jungle and hid himself. By and by he saw <i>Badgi-beria</i> and <i>Mud</i> coming along the path together. He took his bow and arrows and killed them."</p>  
 <p>Another <i>Akar-Bale</i> story about the dove is as follows. "<i>Mud</i> and <i>Kulal</i> were cooking pig and got very hot. They went to bathe and were turned into birds."</p>  
 <p><i>Mud</i> is the bronze-winged dove, <i>Chalcophaps indica</i>, and <i>kulal</i> is the teal, <i>Nettium albigulare</i>.</p>  
 <p>In the North Andaman there are tales about the sea-eagle (<i>k<u>o</u>lo</i>). One is to the effect that at first he used <i>k<u>o</u>bo</i> (<i>Licuala</i>) leaves to fly with. This was before he had wings of his own. Another story is as follows.</p>  
 <p>"<i>Maia K<u>o</u>lo</i> (Sir Sea-eagle) lived at <i>Čona</i> in <i>Tau-’ra-miku</i>. He had a hut in the top of a <i>t<u>o</u>r<u>o</u>ktato</i> tree. He was unmarried.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> When the men went fishing he used to steal their wives. He would only take good-looking girls. He would call out to a girl to come and catch hold of his foot, saying 'I have a fish for you.' If an old or ugly woman came, he would say 'No! not you; go away.' When a young woman came and caught hold of his foot he flew away with her to his hut in the tree."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_3"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_3">191:1</a> The suffix -<i>la</i> is added to personal names and to terms of address in order to express respect.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_4"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_4">192:1</a> The name seems to mean "alone."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_5"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_5">192:2</a> The giant bamboo does not grow in the Andamans, but pieces of it are often drifted ashore, having come from the coast of Burma. The natives pick up these drift-wood bamboos and make buckets of them. It is possible that the bamboo from which the first man was born was just such a piece drifted up from the sea. Unfortunately I neglected to enquire on this point when taking down the legend.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_6"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_6">193:1</a> The meaning of the name is "the cave of <i>Tarai</i>"; I believe that this is the name of a spot in the <i>Aka-J̌eru</i> country.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_7"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_7">193:2</a> The meaning of the name was not discovered.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_11"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_11">195:1</a> When an old man of the <i>A-Pučikwar</i> tribe was giving me the information repeated above, an Andamanese man was with us who had been brought up as a Christian and had some knowledge of the doctrines of that faith. He explained to me that <i>Tomo</i> is the equivalent of the Christian God. This man belonged to the <i>Akar-Bale</i> tribe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_12">196:1</a> These names are common personal names among the aborigines of the present day. Mr Portman derives <i>Nyali</i> from <i>nam-da</i>, the name of a tree, and <i>Irap</i> from <i>pira-da</i> meaning "scattered," but these derivations are far from being authenticated. (Portman, <i>Notes on the Languages of the South Andaman Group of Tribes</i>, p. 70.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_25"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_25">207:1</a> <i>Dik</i> was one of the ancestors. He was a giant and was so big that he could go into the deepest water and never needed a canoe. He used to shoot dugong and porpoise with his bow and arrow. (The natives shoot small fish with a bow and arrows, but large fish and dugong and porpoise they take with harpoons.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_35"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_35">214:1</a> This is the name of some creature that I did not identify, perhaps a kind of spider.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_36"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_36">214:2</a> An Andaman Islander will often, when walking along the shore, shoot his arrows before him, either aiming at some object, or trying to send each one as far as possible. I have never seen them do this in the jungle, for they might easily lose the arrows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_37"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_37">214:3</a> The Andamanese classify resin as a "stone" although they know its vegetable origin.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="tai04.htm#fr_52">223:2</a> The narrator said "resin." The <i>Dipterocarpus</i> tree does not produce resin, but a sort of oil. The marks on the two fishes owe their origin to this incident.</p>
