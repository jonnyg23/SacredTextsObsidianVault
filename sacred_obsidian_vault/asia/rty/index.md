 <h1 align="CENTER">An Inquiry into the Religious Tenets of the Yezeedees</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">by George Percy Badger</h2>

 This is a short extract from a book by a Christian missionary which
 gives some historical observations on the Yezidi people of northern
 Iraq.
 For more information on the Yezidi, refer to
 <a href="../sby/index.htm">Devil Worship:
 The Sacred Books and Traditions of the Yezidiz</a>, which references
 this article heavily.

 <p>
 The Rev. Badger didn't get as close to the Yezidi as Isya Joseph did.
 His access was limited because he was a missionary,
 rather than an anthropologist.
 However, there aren't too many first-hand accounts of the Yezidi during the
 mid-nineteenth century, (actually this is the only one I've discovered so far).
 This document gives another perspective on this fascinating culture
 and their unique religious beliefs.
