 <h3 align="center">14. (The Girls as Avengers.)</h3>
 
 <p> There was a hunter, a very good one, the only one in the village. He was killing ringed seals, large thong-seals. Five brothers, doers of violence, robbed the people of their food. Two daughters of the hunter grew up, and said, "Our father has fed us till we are full-grown. Shall we permit him to be robbed any more?" They pitied their father.</p>
 
 <p> So they began to exercise, became quite strong, and at last killed the violence-doers, with all their kin.</p>
