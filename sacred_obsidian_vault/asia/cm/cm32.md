 <h3 align="center">10. Incantation (used by) a Woman rejected by her Husband and Jealous of her Rival (Ê´wġan ñe´us·qätä uwä<sup>ɛ</sup>´qučitä ẹ´nku lị´nyo).<a name="page_136_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_136_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a></h3>
 
 <p> Then you are this woman! You have so much of my husband's love, that he begins to reject me. But you are not a human being. I make you into carrion lying on the pebbly shore, — old carrion inflated (with rottenness).</p>
 
 <p> I make my husband into a (male) bear. The bear comes from a distant land. He has been starving for a long time, he is very hungry. He sees the carrion. Seeing it, he eats of it. After a while he vomits it up. I make you into the stuff vomited. My husband sees it, and it is of no use to him. He rejects it on the mere seeing (of it).</p>

 <p> At the same time I make this body of mine into a young beaver that has just shed his hair. I make smooth every hair of mine. This woman, object of (my husband's) liking, he leaves her, and desires me, because she is repugnant to look upon.</p>
 
 <p> (She spits, and with the saliva smears her whole body from head to foot. Indeed, the husband begins to have liking for her.)</p>
 
 <p> I, who was neglected recently, I turn myself towards him, I make myself into a deadly pain for him. Let him be attracted by the smell from here, and have a desire for me. Though I reject him, let him be still more persistent.</p>
 
 <p> And really the husband leaves off his former love.</p>
