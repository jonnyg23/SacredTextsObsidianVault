 <h2 align="center">V. — PROVERBS, RIDDLES, SAYINGS.</h2>
 
 <p> The riddles contained in this section were collected among the River Chukchee living on the Middle Anadyr River. They probably arose under Russian influence. Some of them have even been translated from the Russian. On the whole, the Chukchee have no riddles. Of short productions of this kind, they have only a very few proverbs and brief sayings, some of which are given here, while others were published in my "Chukchee Materials." They have also some so-called "comic tales," and word-games, a few of which are given here.</p>
