 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Philippine Folklore Stories</i>, by John Maurice Miller, [1904], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE LIGHT OF THE FLY</h3>  
 <p>The firefly abounds everywhere in the Islands.</p>  
 <p align="center">I</p>  
 <p></p><dir>The King of the Air was in terrible rage,<br> For some one had stolen his ring;<br> And every one wondered whoever could dare<br> To do such a terrible thing.<br> He called all his subjects together and said,<br> "To him that shall find it I'll give<br> Whatever he asks, and this bounty of mine<br> Shall last while his family live."</dir>  
 <p align="center">II</p>  
 <p></p><dir>Away went his good loyal subjects to search,<br> And no one remained but a fly.<br> "Be off!" said the King, "go and join in the search;<br> Would you slight such a ruler as I?"<br> Then up spoke the fly with his little wee voice:<br> "The ring is not stolen," he said.<br> "It stuck to your crown when you put it away,<br> And now it's on top of your head."</dir>  
 <p align="center">III</p>  
 <p></p><dir>The King in surprise took the crown from his head,<br> And there, sure enough, was the ring.<br> "No wonder you saw it, with so many eyes;<br> But what is your wish?" said the King.<br> "O King," said the fly, "I work hard all the day,<br> And I never can go out at night.<br> I should like to go then and be gay with my friends,<br> So all that I wish is a light."</dir>  
 <p align="center">IV</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"You shall have it at once," said the gratified King,<br> And he fastened a light to the fly,<br> Who straightway returned to his home with the prize<br> That was worth more than money could buy.<br> So now you can see him at night with his light<br> And from him this lesson may learn:<br> To keep your eyes open and see the least thing,<br> And Fortune will come in its turn.</dir>
