 <h1 align="CENTER">5. Big-Raven and the Kamaks.</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>Raven-Big said, "I will slide down hill." [He slid down hill.] He went and found a mountain, which was the largest of all. From that mountain he slid down, and rolled into the porch of the house of the kamaks <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">1</font></a>. There he came in. Small kamaks went to the porch, and said, "Oh, human game has come to us of its own free will!"--"I am not human game, I am a man."

 <p>some soup for me!" She cooked some soup, and he ate all alone a large kettleful. Then he said to Miti', "Bring the big hammer! <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">1</font></a>" She gave him the hammer, and he swallowed it. He arrived at to the house of some kamaks, and vomited through the vent-hole. (He filled the whole house) and made them climb upward. The big kamak was standing in the middle of the house. Big-Raven struck him with the hammer. He killed him. Big-Raven came home. That is all.</p>
