 <h1 align="CENTER">14. Eme'mqut and Shellfish-Girl.</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>Dig-Raven lived with his people. Oh, Eme'mqut walked along the seashore, and found some shellfish. He detached one shellfish, and it began to whimper, "Iġiġi'!" He said, "Cease your crying! Yonder among the stone-pine bushes (lies) your detached hood."</p>
 <p>Oh, he went and looked for it! It had turned into a small house. He entered the house and married that Shellfish-Girl. Then he brought her home. They lived there. That is all.</p>
