 <h1 align="CENTER">7. Eme'mqut's Whale-Festival. <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a></h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>Eme'mqut and his people were living. They were hunting whales, and killed one whale. They took it home. Then they arranged a thanksgiving ceremonial. They gathered together all the reindeer-breeding people, also the Magpies (namely, Magpie-Women).</p>
 <p>"Magpie-Woman, you dance!"--"What shall I sing</p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>while dancing? I am unskilful. Vakikikikikiki'. My mother told me, 'Do not leave anything from the other people's wallets!' My grandmother said to me 'Leave something from the other people's wallets!' Vakikikikikiki'!"</p>
 <p>"So it is," said Kĭlu'. "When we come to find them, our wallets are (half-)eaten." Magpie-Woman had nothing to say, so she felt ashamed and flew away.</p>
 <p>"Oh, you Fox-Woman! it is your turn to dance." She grew excited and sang, "My brother, Pilferer, made a knife with a well-ornamented handle. But with what shall I eat the whale-skin? I forgot it. He wanted to strap it to my thigh. With what shall I eat the whale-skin, eh?"</p>

 <p>The old man Big-Raven said, "Ah, ah! they are singing about their feeding at other people's expense." <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a> Still another Fox-Woman began to sing. She also grew excited. "I am she who eats hard excrements. I am she who gnaws the snowshoe-strings."</p>
 <p>Ah, she was brought to shame by Eme'mqut. He said, "Yes, when we find them, the snowshoe- strings are gnawed through." She felt ashamed and went away.</p>
 <p>"O, Small-Magpie-Woman! it is your turn to dance."--"What, then, shall I sing? I feel ashamed. Vakikikikikiki'! On the gables of other people's storehouses, with her running and skipping foot, the magpie is striding and</p>

 <p>pecking at the food."--"Ah, ah! they are singing about their feeding at other people's expense.--O, Raven-Woman! it is your turn to dance."--"Caw, caw! my cousin's shadow passes on the water." [Raven-Woman began to dance (and sing) in this manner: "My cousin's shadow passes on the water."] "Caw, caw! Oh, I like you while you pass!"</p>
 <p>She finished her dance. Then Eme'mqut went out, and the two (Magpies) were sitting there. "O girl! use your voice! Abuse Eme'mqut!"--"He is feeding on dog's inner skin, on reindeer inner skin. (He is consuming) a reindeer-hoof!"--"Off! When have we fed on dog's inner skin? Even when wandering in the open we do not eat (reindeer) inner skin. Much less do we</p>
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>
 <p>eat dog's inner skin." Ah! they felt ashamed and flew away.</p>
 <p>Yini'a-ñawġut wanted to skin a dog. "Halloo! who will hold it for me?' Raven-Woman said, "I will hold it." They went out and began to skin the dog. Raven-Woman pecked out one of its eyes. "Who pecked out this eye here?"--"I do not know." She pecked at the coccyx. "Was it here?"</p>
 <p>Then she pierced the other eye, and the liquid squirted on Yini'a-ñawġut. "Are you now looking for this one? What of that! I only shut my mouth." But this carcass I will lay aside." She buried it in the ground under a steep river-bank.</p>

 <p>Then they finished the thanksgiving ceremonial with the food appointed for distribution. The reindeer-breeding people loaded their sledges quite largely with sole-leather cut out from the middle, and scraped clean of hair, also with thong of the same quality. They tied up their loads (and went away). That is the end.</p>
