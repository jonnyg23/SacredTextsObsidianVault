 <center><h1>62. The Katydid's Warning</h1></center>
 <p>Two hunters camping in the woods were preparing supper one night when a Katydid began singing near them. One of them said sneeringly, "<i>Kû!</i> It sings and don't know that it will die before the season ends." The Katydid answered: "<i>Kû! niwï</i> (onomatope); O, so you say; but you need not boast. You will die before to-morrow night." The next day they were surprised by the enemy and the hunter who had sneered at the Katydid was killed.</p>
