 <p>
 Among their other many cultural gifts to the world,
 Native Americans contributed the game
 which later became known as Lacrosse.
 <cite>The Cherokee Ball Play</cite> vividly describes the ethnography
 of this sport with particular attention
 to its ritual significance.</p>
 <p>
 This sport served as means of community social cohesion,
 an occasion for some big wagers,
 a surrogate for battle with other villages,
 and sounds like a great deal of fun.
 Many of the ceremonial aspects will be familiar to anyone
 involved with High School football.
 Some of the practices required a very high tolerance for pain.
 On a spiritual level the game is a magical battle between shamans,
 and the rituals and ceremonies used to gain
 advantage are of great interest.</p>
 
 <p>This monograph includes musical notation for some of the songs
 transcribed by none other than John Phillip Sousa.</p>
 
 <p>A short monograph about Ojibwa ball play which was
 in the same volume as the Mooney
 article is included as an appendix.</p>
