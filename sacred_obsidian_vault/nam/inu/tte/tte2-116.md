 <p class="indent">116. T<small>HE</small> K<small>UINASARINOOK</small>.—Uvnek, one of the last angakut at the firth of Godthaab, on one of his spirit-flights narrowly escaped being taken by an <i>amarsiniook</i>. After his return he once performed a conjuration and summoned the <i>amarsiniook</i>. A brightness was observed, and a voice was heard from above the house saying, "If thou hadst not happened to be an angakok thou wouldst never have escaped; it was I who killed the <i>kuinasarinook</i> (another monster, dwelling in certain mountains), because it had torn a man to pieces." The auditors then remembered how some time ago a man had been found dead, and his body terribly mutilated; but nobody had been able to make out how the murder was committed, till it was thus explained by Uvnek.</p>
