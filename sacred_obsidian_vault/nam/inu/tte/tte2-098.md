 <p class="indent">98. A<small>TARSUATSIAK</small> and his brothers were a set of fearful manslayers, living in the country about Upernivik (Greenland), who had their heads tattooed with a separate mark for each murder they had committed. On Atarsuatsiak these marks formed a whole row along his forehead from one side to the other. At last the people of the neighbouring places resolved upon having him killed at a place to which he used to resort in order to visit his concubine.</p>
