 <p class="indent">138. T<small>HE</small> B<small>LOODY</small> R<small>OCK</small>.—At a certain wintering-place all the men successively disappeared on going out. Two young lads who were still left, while roaming about came to a mountain continually turning round, and on one side all bloody. One youth tried the bloody path, but fell down and perished. The other waited till the bloody side turned away from him, and climbing gained the summit, when he found a house, and a man who lived by hunting eider-ducks in a lake. After having stayed some time, and rendered assistance to this man, he returned home safely.</p>
