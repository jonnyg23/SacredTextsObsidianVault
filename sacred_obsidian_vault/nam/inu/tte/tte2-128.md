 <p class="indent">128. T<small>HE</small> I<small>NHABITANTS OF</small> A<small>KILINEK</small>.—Iviangersook, while travelling far and wide for some time, settled down in Akilinek, leaving descendants there. Many years after, some people from the farthest north, in crossing the ice, came to a crevice far off the coast, and had some talk with people who appeared on the opposite side and announced themselves as Iviangersook's descendants in Akilinek. The countrymen from each side alternately enumerated all the products of their homesteads.</p>
