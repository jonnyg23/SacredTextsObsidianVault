 <p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="oll18.htm#fr_83">404:2</a> My former translation, and those of Barranca and Tschudi, treated <i>puma</i> and <i>amaru</i> (snake) as epithets applied to <i>Mama Ccacca</i>. Zegarra considers that the puma and snake were intended to be actually in the dungeon, and I believe he is right. The puma would not have hurt his fellow-prisoner. Unpleasant animals were occasionally put into the prisons of criminals. The Incas kept <i>pumas</i> as pets.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="oll18.htm#fr_84">405:1</a> The early Incas never married their sisters or relations. Pachacuti's mother was daughter of the chief of Anta. His wife, <i>Anahuarqui</i>, was no relation. But the wife of Tupac Yupanqui was his sister Mama Ocllo.</p>
