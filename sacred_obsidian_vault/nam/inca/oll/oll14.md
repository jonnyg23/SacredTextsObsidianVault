 </i><p>The great terrace entrance to Ollantay-tampu. On R. <i>a long masonry wall with recesses at intervals. At back a great entrance doorway. On</i> L. t<i>erraces descend, with view of valley and mountains</i>.</p> 
 <p>(<i>Guards discovered at entrance doorway. To them enter</i> RUMI-ÑAUI <i>in rags, his face cut and slashed with wounds, and covered with blood</i>.)</p> 
 <p>  <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Will no one here have pity on me?<br>   <i>One of the Guards</i>. Who art thou, man?<br> Who has ill-treated thee?<br> Thou comest in a frightful state,<br> Covered with blood and gaping wounds.<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Go quickly to thy king and say<br> That one he loves has come to him.<br>   <i>One of the Guards</i>. Thy name?<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. There is no need to give a name.<br>   <i>One of the Guards</i>. Wait here.</p>

 <p>  <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. A thousand times I thee salute,<br> Ollantay, great and puissant king!<br> Have pity on a fugitive<br> Who seeks a refuge here with thee.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Who art thou, man? Approach nearer.<br> Who has thus ill-treated thee?<br> Were such deep and fearful wounds<br> Caused by a fall, or what mishap?<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Thou knowest me, O mighty chief.<br> I am that stone that fell down once,<br> But now I fall before thy feet;<br> O Inca! mercy! Raise me up!</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Kneels</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i>. Art thou the noble Rumi-ñaui,<br> Great Chief and Lord of Hanan-suyu?<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Yes, I was that well-known Chief--<br> A bleeding fugitive to-day.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Rise, comrade mine. Let us embrace.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Rises</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Who has dared to treat thee thus,<br> And who has brought thee here to me<br> Within my fortress, on my hearth?</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>To attendants</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Bring new clothes for my oldest friend.</p> 
 <p align="RIGHT">[<i>Exit an attendant</i>.</p> 
 <p>How is it that thou art alone?<br> Camest thou not fearing death?<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. A new king reigns in Cuzco now--<br> Tupac Yupanqui is installed.<br> Against the universal wish,<br> He rose upon a wave of blood;<br> Safety he sees in headless trunks,</p>

Grieve not, old friend Rumi-ñaui,<br> Thy wounds before all must be cured;<br> I see in thee th' avenging knife,<br> To use against the tyrant's heart.<br> At Tampu now we celebrate<br> The Sun's great Raymi festival;<br> On that day all who love my name,<br> Throughout my realms hold festival.<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Those three days of festival<br> To me will be a time of joy,<br> Perhaps I may be healed by then,<br> So that my heart may pleasure seek.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. It will be so. For three whole nights<br> We drink and feast, to praise the Sun,<br> The better to cast all care aside<br> We shall be shut in Tampu fort.<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. The youths, as is their wont, will find<br> Their great delight in those three nights,<br> Then will they rest from all their toils,<br> And carry off the willing girls.</p>
