 <p>  <i>Yma Sumac</i>. A thousand strange presentiments<br> Crowd on me now, I scarce know what--<br> Perhaps I shall see that mournful one<br> Whose fate already breaks my heart.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(Pitu Salla <i>returns with a cup of water, a small covered vase containing food, and a torch which she gives to</i> Yma Sumac. <i>She leads</i> Yma Sumac <i>through bushes to the stone door, fixes the torch, presses something, and the door swings round</i>.)</p>

 <p>  <i>Yma Sumac</i>. Oh, my friend, what do I behold?<br> Is it a corpse that I must see?<br> Oh, horror! A dungeon for the dead!</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>She faints</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Pitu Salla</i>. What misfortune has now arrived?<br> O my Sumac, my dearest love,<br> O come to thyself without delay!<br> Arouse thee. Arise, my lovely flower.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(Yma Sumac <i>revives</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Fear not, my dove, my lovely friend,<br> 'Tis not a corpse. The princess lives,<br> Unhappy, forlorn, she lingers here.<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. Is she, then, still a living being?<br>   <i>Pitu Salla</i>. Approach nearer, and you can help.<br> She lives indeed. Look. Watch her now.<br> Give me the water and the food.</p><dir> <dir>

 <p>O fair princess, I bring thee food<br> And cooling water to refresh.<br> Try to sit up. I come with help.<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. Who art thou, my sweetest dove?<br> Why art thou shut in such a place?<br>   <i>Pitu Salla</i>. Take a little food, we pray.<br> Perchance without it You may die.<br>   <i>Cusi Coyllur</i>. How happy am I now to see,<br> After these long and dismal years,<br> The new and lovely face of one<br> Who comes with thee and gives me joy.<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. O my princess, my sister dear,<br> Sweet bird, with bosom of pure gold,<br> What crime can they accuse thee of,<br> That they can make thee suffer thus?<br> What cruel fate has placed thee here<br> With death on watch in serpent's form?</p>

 <p>  <i>Cusi Coyllur</i>. O charming child, the seed of love,<br> Sweet flower for my broken heart,<br> I have been thrust in this abyss.<br> I once was joined to a man<br> As pupil is part of the eye;<br> But alas! has he forgotten me?<br> The King know not that we were joined<br> By such indissoluble bonds,<br> And when he came to ask my hand,<br> That King dismissed him in a rage,<br> And cruelly confined me here.<br> Many years have passed since then,<br> Yet, as you see, I'm still alive;<br> No single soul have I beheld<br> For all those sad and dismal years,<br> Nor have I found relief nor hope.<br> But who art thou, my dear, my love,<br> So young, so fresh, so pitiful?<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. I too, like thee, am full of grief,<br> For long I've wished to see and love,<br> My poor forlorn and sad princess.<br> No father, no mother are mine,<br> And there are none to care for me.<br>   <i>Cusi Coyllur</i>. What age art thou?<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. I ought to number many years,<br> For I detest this dreadful house,<br> And as it is a dreary place,<br> The time in it seems very long.<br>   <i>Pitu Salla</i>. She ought to number just ten years<br> According to the account I've kept.<br>   <i>Cusi Coyllur</i>. And what is thy name?<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. They call me Yma Sumac now,<br> But to give it me is a mistake.<br>   <i>Cusi Coyllur</i>. O my daughter! O my lost love,</p>

 <p>Come to thy mother's yearning heart.</p><dir> <dir>

 <p>Thou art all my happiness,<br> My daughter, come, O come to me;<br> This joy quite inundates my soul,<br> <i>It is the name I gave to thee</i>.<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i>. O my mother, to find thee thus!<br> We must be parted never more.<br> Do not abandon me in grief.<br> To whom can I turn to free thee,<br> To whom can I appeal for right?<br>   <i>Pitu Salla</i>. Make no noise, my dearest friend.:<br> To find us thus would ruin me.<br> Let us go. I fear the Mothers.<br>   <i>Yma Sumac</i> (<i>to</i> Cusi Coyllur). Suffer a short time longer here,<br> Until I come to take thee hence,<br> Patience for a few more days.<br> Alas! my mother dear! I go,<br> But full of love, to seek for help.</p>
