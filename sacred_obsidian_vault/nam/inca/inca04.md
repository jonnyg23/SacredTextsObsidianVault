 <h1 align="CENTER">THREE INCA PRAYERS</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">From: Ancient Civilizations of the Andes by Philip Ainsworth Means, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931, pp. 437-439.</h3>
 <h2 align="CENTER">TO VIRACOCHA</h2>
 <p>Viracocha, Lord of the Universe!<br>
 Whether male or female,<br>
 at any rate commander of heat and reproduction,<br>
 being one who,<br>
 even with His spittle, can work sorcery,<br>
 Where art Thou?<br>
 Would that Thou wert not hidden from this son of Thine!<br>
 He may be above;<br>
 He may be below;<br>
 or, perchance, abroad in space.<br>
 Where is his mighty judgment-seat?<br>
 Hear me!<br>
 He may be spread abroad among the upper waters;<br>
 or, among the lower waters and their sands<br>
 He may be dwelling.<br>
 Creator of the world,<br>
 Creator of man,<br>
 great among my ancestors,<br>
 before Thee my eyes fail me,<br>
 though I long to see Thee;<br>
 for, seeing Thee,<br>
 knowing Thee,<br>
 learning from Thee,<br>
 understanding Thee,<br>
 I shall be seen by Thee,<br>
 and Thou wilt know me.<br>
 The Sun--the Moon;<br>
 The Day--the Night;<br>
 Summer--Winter;<br>
 not in vain,<br>
 in orderly succession,<br>
 do they march to their destined place,<br>
 to their goal.<br>
 They arrive<br>
 wherever<br>
 Thy royal staff<br>
 Thou bearest.<br>
 Oh! Harken to me,<br>
 listen to me,<br>
 let it not befall<br>
 that I grow weary<br>
 and die.</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">TO VIRACOCHA</h2>
 <p>O conquering Viracocha!<br>
 Ever-present Viracocha!<br>
 Thou who art without equal upon the earth!<br>
 Thou who art from the beginnings of the world until its end!<br>
 Thou gavest life and valour to men, saying,<br>
 "Let this be a man."<br>
 And to woman, saying,<br>
 "Let this be a woman."<br>
 Thou madest them and gavest them being.<br>
 Watch over them, that they may live in health and in peace.<br>
 Thou who art in the highest heavens,<br>
 and among the clouds of the tempest,<br>
 grant them long life,<br>
 and accept this our sacrifice,<br>
 O Creator.</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">TO PACHACAMAC</h2>
 <p>O Pachacamac!<br>
 Thou who hast existed from the beginning,<br>
 Thou who shalt exist until the end,<br>
 powerful but merciful,<br>
 Who didst create man by saying,<br>
 "Let man be,"<br>
 Who defendest us from evil,<br>
 and preservest our life and our health,<br>
 art Thou in the sky or upon the earth?<br>
 In the clouds or in the deeps?<br>
 Hear the voice of him who implores Thee,<br>
 and grant him his petitions.<br>
 Give us life everlasting,<br>
 preserve us, and accept this our sacrifice.</p></body>
