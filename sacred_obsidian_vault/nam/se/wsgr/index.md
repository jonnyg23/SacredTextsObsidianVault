 This is a collection of Native American lore from Texas.
 It is focused on the Tejas, a Caddoan group which called itself the Hasinai.
 The term 'Tejas' is from a Caddoan word which means 'friend,'
 and it gave us the name of Texas.
 The Tejas lived between the Sabine and Trinity rivers,
 in modern south-east Texas.
 They were the furthest west of the Southeastern native groups, in close
 contact with the Plains tribes, so their folklore reflects both regions.
 </p>
 Written in a simple declarative style to appeal to young readers,
 <cite>When the Storm God Rides</cite> is not a work of ethnology,
 but is based on genuine traditional folklore from the region.
 The material has been romanticized by the author, and sometimes softened
 for the audience, although not to the point of becoming maudlin as
 often occurs in this kind of book.
 However, since there is a paucity of material on the southeastern Native
 Americans, and specifically those from the Texas area, this fills a gap.
