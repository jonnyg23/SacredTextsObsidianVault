 <h3 align="CENTER">36. HOW THE TERRAPIN'S BACK CAME TO BE IN CHECKS (53)</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">(SECOND VERSION)</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</p>
 <p>A Terrapin went hunting and met a woman. She accused him of having slandered her. He denied it, but when they passed a hollow tree into which he thought he could crawl, he said: "Yes; I did it; I am the man."</p>
 <p>He tried to crawl into the tree but his shot bag got caught and he stuck fast. The woman caught him and beat his back to pieces.</p>
 <p>By and by the ants came and he said:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I will give you my blood,<br>
 I will give you my fat,<br>
 If you will help me mend my back.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>They consented and brought him some tar with which he mended his shell, but it was always in checks, and he never afterwards had any fat, nor any blood.</p>
