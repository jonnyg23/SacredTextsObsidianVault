 <h3 align="CENTER">35. THE ALLIGATOR BENEFACTOR (31)</h3>
 <p>While a man who had set out to hunt was traveling about he saw an Alligator lying on the ground in the pine woods. The Alligator said, "Hunt for some water with me and put me into it and I will let you have whatever you want." So the man took him on his back and started off. Traveling on, he got to the water, and when he threw the Alligator down in it he went round and round blowing up bubbles. Then he came out and said, "What do you want?" and the man answered, "I want to be a good ball player and run fast." "What do you want next?" said the Alligator. "I want two wives." "I will grant you those things," replied the Alligator.</p>
 <p>And the man came to be a good ball player and could run fast. He also obtained two wives.</p>
