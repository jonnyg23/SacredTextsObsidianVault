 <h3 align="CENTER">42. THE WOMAN WHO TURNED INTO A SNAKE (35)</h3>
 <p>A woman got some bison grease and walked along with it. On the bank of a river she picked up some turtle and terrapin eggs and she fried them. Her husband told her not to fry the turtle and terrapin eggs together with the grease but she did so and ate them. Immediately her legs twisted together and became like the tail of a snake. She went down into the water, her husband's people following her, wailing. When they called four times to her she came out. She looked wholly like a snake. Then she went back into the water and stayed there and was never seen again.</p>
