 <h3 align="CENTER">69. HOW RABBIT GOT THE WIDOW'S DAUGHTER</h3>
 <p>An old woman had a beautiful daughter with whom Rabbit was in love. So he went to the old woman and asked to marry her. But the old woman made excuses, saying that the girl was not old enough, did not understand housework, etc. Rabbit thereupon went off and made a plan, which he proceeded to carry out. He took a cane and made a hole in the back of the fireplace so that the sound could come through the fire. Then one night he got behind the fire and spoke through his cane, saying: "Anyone who has a growing daughter and does not allow her to marry will surely die, will surely die." Then the old woman was frightened and said to her daughter: "Listen to this. When he comes back you had better marry him." And so Rabbit got the girl.</p>
