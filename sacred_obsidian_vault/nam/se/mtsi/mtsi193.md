 <h3 align="CENTER">57. THE TAR BABY (63)</h3>
 <p>Rabbit was stealing potatoes. Then the people made a tar image in the shape of a man and set it up near the potato field to scare him away. When Rabbit came near he asked it for potatoes, but it would not give him any. Then he said he would hit it with his fist, but his hand stuck to it. When he hit it with his other fist that stuck also. He kicked it and his foot stuck. The same thing happened to the other foot. Then they wrapped him up in it. They wrapped the tar round and round him and killed him.</p>
