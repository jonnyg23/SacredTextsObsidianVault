 <h3 align="CENTER">63. RABBIT FOOLS WILDCAT (69)</h3>
 <p>While traveling along Rabbit saw a wild horse lying asleep. For some time he sat looking at it. By and by Wildcat came there and Rabbit said, "See what I killed. When I have skinned it you can help me eat it." Wildcat wanted it and sat waiting, when Rabbit said, "You slip up and sit down on it." Wildcat sat on the horse lying asleep, whereupon it awoke, began to buck, and ran away with Wildcat sticking on his back.</p>
