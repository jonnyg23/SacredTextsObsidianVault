 <h3 align="CENTER">58. RABBIT AND THE DUCKS (56)</h3>
 <p>Once when Rabbit was traveling along he came to a lot of ducks swimming in a pond. Presently he went to them with a cord tied about his waist, dived under the place where the ducks were and, when he reached them, tied all of their legs together. When he had finished he came up in their midst and the ducks flew away; they carried Rabbit along hanging in the middle.</p>
 <p>Rabbit's grandmother had just been rubbing a pot smooth and had set it down when they flew over her. He called to his grandmother and she saw him. When he got just above her she threw the pot over him and it cut the string so that he fell down.</p>
