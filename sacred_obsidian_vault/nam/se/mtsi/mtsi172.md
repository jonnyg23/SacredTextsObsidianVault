 <h3 align="CENTER">36. THE ALLIGATOR BENEFACTOR (31)</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">(SECOND VERSION)</h3>
 <p>A man was out hunting. By and by he saw an Alligator lying on the ground. He was afraid and walked around it for a while but the Alligator said, "Do not fear me. Take me on your back and throw me into the water." The man said, "All right," and he took up the Alligator on his back, carried him to the water and threw him in. The Alligator was hungry so he dived into the water, went round and round, picked up some fish and ate many of them. Then he stopped and said to the man, "Ask me whatever you want and I will give it to you." The man asked for two wives and said he wanted to be a good deer hunter.</p>
