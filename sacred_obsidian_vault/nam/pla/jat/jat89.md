 <h3 align="CENTER">87. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>In olden times when anyone died they put on his moccasins, and leggings. If he had many relatives they brought from different places, personal property, such as shirts, leggings, blankets. With these, which were all of the best, they dressed the body. Many people came together and wailed. They painted the face red. The better and smaller pieces of property were placed inside the blanket in which the body was wrapped. The corpse was then placed on a horse which was led by two of his kinsmen. A third man accompanied them. A grave was dug and the body placed in it. Over the grave were placed sticks and stones. The horse was then killed and its head cut off. All the relatives of the deceased cut their hair. This was the way they did.</p>
