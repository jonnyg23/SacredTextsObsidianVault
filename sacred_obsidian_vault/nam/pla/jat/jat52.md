 <h3 align="CENTER">50. LEWIS WOODPECKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>"My name is Niji. My eyes shine. My beads are becoming to me and my coat is very black. I raise my children in a hole in a tree. My young like to live there. They feed upon grasshoppers and flies. I live with my children. My red breast is becoming to me. I shout every summer and the people like to hear me. They all know my voice. I do not eat much pitch but I like acorns." This way he spoke they say.</p>
