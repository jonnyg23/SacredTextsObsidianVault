They came toward each other, stood some distance apart and talked by the sign language. They motioned that they should come near to each other.

The Jicarilla held up his bow and put it on the ground. The enemy drew his knife, showed it to the Jicarilla, and placed it on the ground. The Jicarilla signed that he had no knife. Then they agreed to meet in the center and to make friends. Each said that he was without weapons. They met and commenced to talk by signs. Soon they were fighting with their fists. The Jicarilla was getting tired. The enemy picked him up and commenced to carry him where his weapons were lying. The Jicarilla had a knife suspended about his neck.
