 <h3 align="CENTER">13. NAIYENESGANI TAKES HIS LEAVE (Second Version).</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>Naiyenesgani came to the rock that was rolling over people. It rolled away from him and he could not overtake it to kill it. After trying for some time to pass it, he succeeded in getting ahead of it and shooting it. Before he killed it he said, "What shall I do with you who swallow people?" Killing it, he said, "This is what I do with bad people, I kill them." He did not go up to it nor did he cut it. <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
 <p>"Now I will go and look for other bad things," Naiyenesgani said. "Wait for me, my friend." Then four of them started away toward the east.

 <p>"Do you like it?" he asked the people. "I have killed for you all the monsters which were in the world. That is why my name is, 'Monsters-he-kills'. Are you all pleased?" "Yes," they replied. "I made these things which are on the earth so that you may like them. I have made everything that you will eat; the berries, amole fruit, and plums. Are you satisfied? I made all these for you when you were poor and had nothing. Are you pleased with all these fruits I have made for you." "They are very good, my grandson," she said. "You will eat them every summer. I do not wish that you shall live on these things all the time because I am not going to talk about them for you always."</p>
