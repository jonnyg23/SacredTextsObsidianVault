 <h3 align="CENTER">THE CONCEPT NI.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(By Sword.)</p>
 <p>A man's <i>Ni</i> is his life. It is the same as his breath and that which gives him his strength. It is the <i>Ni</i> which keeps the inside of a man clean. If the <i>Ni</i> is weak, he cannot perform this office and if it goes away the man dies. <i>Niya</i> is the ghost or spirit which is given to a man at birth and is that which causes the <i>Ni</i>. The Lakota have a ceremony which they call <i>Ini kaga</i> or <i>Inipi</i>. The white people call it taking a sweat bath. The idea of the Lakota is that the <i>Inipi</i> makes man's spirit strong so that it may cleanse all within the body and so that the <i>Ni</i> may drive from his body all that makes him tired or that causes disease or that causes him to have evil thoughts. The ceremony must be performed in a <i>ini ti</i> or what the white people call a sweatlodge. The <i>ini ti</i> must be made according to Lakota custom; otherwise, the ceremony would be of no avail.</p>
 <i></i><p>Wowihanble is the name for a supernatural communication. It is what the white people call a holy dream or vision. In former times, if a man wished to know the will of his god he sought a vision. The term for this is <i>ihanblapi</i>. To seek such a vision a Lakota must think about it all the time, but first strengthen his spirit by the <i>inikaga</i>.</p>
