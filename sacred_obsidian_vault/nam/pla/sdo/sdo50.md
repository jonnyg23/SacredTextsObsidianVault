 <h3 align="CENTER">WAKAN TANKA.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(By Sword.)</p>
 <p>When <i>Wakan Tanka</i> wishes one of mankind to do something he makes his wishes known either in a vision or through a shaman.. . . The shaman addresses <i>Wakan Tanka</i> as <i>Tobtob Kin</i>. This is part of the secret language of the shamans.. . . . <i>Tobtob Kin</i> are four times four gods while <i>Tob Kin</i> is only the four winds. The four winds is a god and is the <i>akicita</i> or messenger of all the other gods. The four times four are: <i>Wikan and Hanwikan</i>; <i>Taku Skanskan</i> and <i>Tatekan</i> and <i>Tob Kin</i> and <i>Yumnikan</i>; <i>Makakan</i> and <i>Wohpe</i>; <i>Inyankan</i> and <i>Wakinyan</i>; <i>Tatankakan</i>; <i>Hunonpakan</i>; <i>Wanagi</i>; <i>Waniya</i>; <i>Nagila; </i>and <i>Wasicunpi</i>. These are the names of the good Gods as they are known to the people.</p>
 <p>Wakan Tanka is like sixteen different persons; but each person is <i>kan</i>. Therefore, they are all only the same as one . . . . All the God persons have ton. Ton is the power to do supernatural things . . . . Half of the good Gods are <i>ton ton</i> (have physical properties) and half are <i>ton ton sni</i> (have no physical properties). Half of those who are <i>ton ton</i> are t<i>on ton yan</i> (visible), and half of those who are <i>ton ton sni</i> are <i>ton ton yan sni</i> (Invisible). All the other Gods are visible or invisible as they choose to be . . . . All the evil Gods are visible or invisible as they choose to be . . . . The invisible Gods never appear in a vision except to a Shaman . . . . Except for the Sun dance, the ceremonies for the visible and the invisible Gods differ. The Sun dance is a ceremony the same as if <i>Wikan</i> were both visible and invisible. This is because <i>Wi</i> is the chief of the Gods. . . .</p>
