 <p>Bálölöokong goes to Coyote's kiva, which he fills entirely, so that Coyote has to go outside. Coyote is angry and makes large artificial tail, which he fastens to his own. He visits Bálölöokong and tail fills kiva. Bálölöokong has to go outside and when Coyote leaves sets artificial tail on fire. Grain is set on fire and Coyote runs away and finally reaches Little Colorado River, in which he is drowned, as in No. 59, but here he jumps into river because fire on tail reaches his natural tail.</p>
