 <p>Coyote and Humming-bird both have children and are good friends. Coyote goes to place where is refuse of village to look for pieces of skin, and bird goes to place close by and buries himself, his bill only protruding. Coyote comes and thinks bill is needle and pulls at it. Bird says it is his bill and laughs at Coyote. They go to bird's house and converse. In evening Coyote goes home, inviting bird to visit him to-morrow. Next morning bird goes to Coyote's house, first hunting worms. Near house she sees something protruding from ground and thinks it is gourd jug. She pulls at it and Coyote says it is his snout. Coyote feeds friend on juniper berries, Coyote eating some. After talking awhile bird returns home.</p>
