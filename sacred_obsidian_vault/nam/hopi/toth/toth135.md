 <p>Bear kills people living at Mishóngnovi. Pö'okong lives with grandmother at Skeleton Katcina house. Chief makes bow and arrows and also buckskin ball for Pö'okong and báho for grandmother. He takes them to house and asks Pö'okong to kill bear. Pö'okong hunts bear and shoots him in throat and hits him with ball stick. He skins bear and fills skin with dry grass. Then he ties it to himself and drags it very fast, screaming. People see him and tell grandmother bear is following him. He ascends house and throws bear to grandmother, who is scared, and dies. Pö'okong wakes her up and she whips him for searing her. Chief happy, as bear stops killing people.</p>
