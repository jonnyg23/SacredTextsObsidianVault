 <p>While maiden is dipping out water at spring, Bálölöokong comes out, and by strong inhalations draws her towards him. He embraces her and disappears with her in water. Mother goes to look for her, and finds her tracks descending to water, and jug is standing there and old blanket. She tells father, who at once makes ball and arrow and takes them to house of Pö'okonghoya  and his brother. They are romping, but their grand mother, Spider Woman, makes them be quiet. She gives man small ball of hurúshiki, which increases as he eats from it. He gives bows to youths and eagle nakwákwosis to Spider Woman, who tells him what to do. He invites friends, and they make many nakwákwosis. Next morning Spider Woman and youths go to village, and brother of lost maiden is dressed up. Spider Woman instructs him, and they go to spring. Pö'okongs sing and brother dances. Bálölöokong comes out holding maiden in left arm. Brother approaches edge of spring and reaches for sister, but he begins to cry, and Bálölöokong disappears with her. They, try again, and when Bálölöokong again appears brother grasps maiden and strikes him on head with club. Serpent releases maiden, and only his skin is floating on water like sack. They put other clothes on maiden and lay red feather pû'hu on path. They throw tray with nakwákwosis into spring for price of maiden, and prayer-offerings that nothing further should befall her. Bálölöokong still seen there by women, who become sick. He is now small.</p>
