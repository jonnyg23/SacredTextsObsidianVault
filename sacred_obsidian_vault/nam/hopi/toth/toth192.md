 <p>Grasshopper and Coyote are great friends. Grasshopper has children and big field. At planting time he tells wife others are going too help him and she is to put up good deal of food. She prepares food and jug of water. These, with seeds, Grasshopper takes on back and goes to field. He waits in kísi he has built until nearly noon, but nobody comes. Then he eats food and goes to field and plants all alone. Afternoon is very hot. He returns to kísi, drinks, and lays down to rest, leaning feet against side. Coyote comes and asks why he is lying that way. Grasshopper says he is tired and he is afraid kísi will fall on him. Coyote lays down beside friend, also leaning his hind feet against booth. Grasshopper Jumps up and says he will get more water. He picks up jug and goes home, and, as he is planning mischief against his friend, he tells children to go to their uncle Deer. Coyote waits until he is tired. He jumps up without booth falling. Says Grasshopper has lied and that he will go and eat up his children. He goes to house of friend and finds it closed. He follows tracks to house of Deer and asks if grasshopper has come with his family. He wants Deer to get them out, but Deer tells Coyote to come in himself. He hesitates, but at last goes down ladder and sees two strong Deer standing. As he steps down into deeper portion of kiva, one Deer picks him up with horns and throws him towards hatchway. As he falls, other Deer does same, and so they keep it up until he is dead. Grasshoppers then go and scatter over country.</p>
