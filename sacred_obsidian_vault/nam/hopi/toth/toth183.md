 <p>On Coyote's returning from hunt one hot day, he finds his children very thirsty. They are still very young. He goes to Toríva for water, which he gets in his mouth. On returning he sees Eagle dancing on one leg. Coyote laughs and spills water. He runs back to spring and again fills mouth with water, which he again spills through laughing at dancing Eagle. He is angry and goes to cedar timber to get some pitch. He goes again to Toríva and, after drinking, fills his mouth and pastes it up with pitch. He again sees Eagle dancing and again laughs, but he does not spill water. He finds his children sleeping nicely and pours water into their mouths, but they do not awaken. They are dead. He is angry and goes to kill Eagle, who flies away, and shows that he has two legs.</p>
