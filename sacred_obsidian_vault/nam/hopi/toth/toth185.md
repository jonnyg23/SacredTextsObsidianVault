 <p>Coyote walking about sees Chíros dancing and singing. He wants to dance and Chíros give him feathers, making him wings and tail and putting small feathers into his body. They dance and sing again, Coyote with them, and then they fly upward very high. Now they crowd around Coyote and take away their feathers. Coyote falls to earth and dies. Chíros laugh at him and are pleased that he is dead.</p>
