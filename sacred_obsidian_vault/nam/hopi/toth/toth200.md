 <p>Little Gray Mice and Little Brown Mice are on very friendly terms. They go to village at night and whenever one finds corn, it invites others to come. They often visit and dance together and sing song about dawn. Gray Mouse finds something good to eat and tells Brown Mice. They all come from both places, but quarrel over food and there is great fight. Gray Mice go to Brown Mice again and sing different song. Then they rush back to their home. Brown Mice laugh and say others are afraid of them. Two kinds of mice have not been on good terms since.</p>
