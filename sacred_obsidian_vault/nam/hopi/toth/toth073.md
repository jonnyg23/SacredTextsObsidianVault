 <p>In Mishóngnovi the people were living. North of the village at the bluff Kwaná Vüvi lived the Red Eagle, and east of the village at Where-Coyotes'-Heads-are-put-in (Ishqöttangat) <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">3</font></a>, lived the Coyote. He had children. During the day it was very hot and he went to hunt something for them, but did not kill anything. So he returned to his children, who were very thirsty. They were living only a very short time. Now he went after water for them to Toríva, but he had no jug, so he got water in his mouth. When he arrived there he drank and drew out his mouth full of water. With his mouth full of water he ran to his children and now he arrived at Kwanávüvi, and there on the bluff sat the Red Eagle. He danced on one leg and sang as follows:</p>

 <p>Tipoki homponcholo<br> Yep nu (Here I)<br> Cholo, cholo, chololololo. <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="toth074.htm#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Coyote laughed at the Red Eagle and spilled the water. Now he ran back to the spring again, and again filled his mouth with water. Now he ran again, and again arrived at the Red Eagle, who was still dancing, and because he (the Coyote) laughed again, he again poured out the water. Now the Coyote was angry. "Why do you dance here that way?" he asked the Red Eagle. "Now let me go to the cedar timber and hunt some pitch," and he ran very fast to the timber, and there a piñon-tree had a great deal of pitch. He cut that off and carrying it, went home. Now he again descended to Toríva and drank there, very much, because he was very thirsty. When he had drank he filled his mouth and then pasted up his mouth with the pitch. Now he again came to the Red Eagle, who was again dancing. The Coyote again laughed, but his mouth was closed up tightly and he did not spill the water. Now at last he ran to his children very fast. When he arrived there they were sleeping nicely. When he had taken off the pitch he poured the water into their mouths, but they did not get awake. Why, they had died! Now because he was very angry he wanted to kill the Red Eagle, and went to him, very angry. When he arrived there the Red Eagle flew away. When he flew away he showed him his leg and, behold! he had two legs. The Coyote jumped at him but did not catch him, and thus he did not kill him.</p>
