 <p>Chief of Ants says that in four days they are going to have Katcina initiation. On fourth day three ants dress up as Katcinas. Some make sand picture in kiva and Ants bring in children to be initiated. Katcina priest relates story and four little Kóyemsis have performance. At signal Katcinas come running and after circling kiva several times, enter it. They flog little Ant children so hard that they almost cut through middle of body. When through, all Katcinas run away. That is why ants are now so thin in middle of bodies.</p>
