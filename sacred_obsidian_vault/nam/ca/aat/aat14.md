 <h1 align="CENTER">ACHOMAWI MYTHS</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">COLLECTED BY JEREMIAH CURTIN; EDITED BY ROLAND B. DIXON</h2>
 <p>[NOTE.--The following myths were collected by Jeremiah Curtin for the Bureau of American Ethnology. They were placed in my hands by the Editor for preparation for insertion in this Journal; and in so doing, I have made no changes other than to give the English names for the various characters, and to add a word or two here and there, where the original manuscript was obscure or imperfect because of hasty copying. One myth has been omitted from the series, as it is only a brief version of the Loon-Woman myth already published in this journal, vol. xxi, p. 165.--R. B. DIXON.]</p>
