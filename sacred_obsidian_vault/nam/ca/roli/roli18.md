 <p>Among the people living near El Toro, there was a boy who was always hunting rabbits, quail, and the like with bow and arrows. One day, near Santa Ana, he saw a rabbit which he tried to catch, but it ran into a hole in the ground. He got a stick and poked in the hole. He felt the rabbit, so he kept on digging, and went farther and farther down, every little while finding something, which, he would say, "I will take to my mother," "to my sister," and so on.</p>  
 <p>So he went on, and finally came to a place where those Chungichnish were living. They all said, "Witte,""Welcome"to him, and told him to sit down. Then they built a big fire, a very large fire.

 <p>This is the reason people dance in that way, jumping and moving about.</p>
