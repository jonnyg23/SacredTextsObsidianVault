 <p>There is a wonderful little knoll, near Bonsall, the Spanish name of it Mora, the Indian name Katuta; <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">287</font></a> and when there was a flood that killed all the people, some stayed on this hill and were not drowned. All the high mountains were covered, but this little hill remained above the water. One can see heaps of seashells and seaweed upon it, and ashes where those people cooked their food, and stones set together, left as they used them for cooking; and the shells were those of shell-fish they caught to eat. <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">288</font></a></p>  
 <p>They stayed there till the water went down. From the top of this hill one can see that the high mountains are lower than it is. This hill was one of the First People. <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">289</font></a></p>
