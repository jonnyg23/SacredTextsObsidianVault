 <p>The Tamyush, sacred stone bowls, were never made. They were among the first people, born of the Earth-mother. If the chief in whose charge they are, does not take good care of them they go away.</p>  
 <p>They have been seen going along the road, and one can follow their track in the dust. It is like a rattlesnake track, but broader.</p>  
 <p>At Pichanga one lately came there. A raven was seen flying along above the road, and every now and then he swooped down as if following some object. A man went to see what was there, and found the Tamyush. It had been coming along the road to Pichanga. He took it to his home and they had a big ceremony over it. The man is dead now.</p>
