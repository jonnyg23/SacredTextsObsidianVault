 <p>The wood most used for fire making is that of <i>Baccharis Douglasii</i>. A flat stick of this, as dry as possible, is obtained and a shallow hole made in it, from which a small notch is cut to the edge of the stick. The drill, a short piece of wood with the lower end trimmed to fit the hole, is then placed in it and twirled rapidly between the palms with a downward pressure. This causes a fine dust to be ground from the stick. This dust runs out to one side through the notch, and if conditions are favorable, after a time ignites, no tinder being used. But if the wood is not thoroughly dry, or if the air is moist, it is exceedingly difficult to kindle a fire by this method.</p>
