 <p>The chief article of clothing was a cape-like garment of fur covering the upper part of the body and reaching almost to the knees, but this was probably only worn in the coldest weather. During most of the year the men are said to have worn no clothing at all. The capes were sometimes made of rabbit skins, cut</p>

 <p>into strips and woven with a woof of twine. Others were made of deer-skins, and some of sea-otter skins. These latter were the most highly prized, but were not common, except perhaps on the coast.</p>  
 <p>Another article of dress was an apron, pishkwut, generally of net-work, made from the twine obtained from dogbane, <i>Apocynum cannabinum</i>, or the milkweed, <i>Asclepias eriocarpa</i>. Another apron, shehevish, was made of the inner bark of willow or cottonwood. This was worn behind, while the apron of network was worn in front. Both these, aprons were worn exclusively by women, who never went entirely unclothed.</p>  
 <p>A basket hat of coiled ware was worn by women, especially when they had a burden to carry, when it was used to protect the forehead, the cord of the carrying net resting on it. Men might also use this basket hat when they had a burden to carry. Another covering for the head was woven from rushes; this was used in the same manner as the coiled basket hat.</p>
