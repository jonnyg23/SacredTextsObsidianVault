 <p>Paiowa is the evening star. Wakara's most interesting daughters are always Halaia, or Halai Auna, and Paiowa. The first is the morning, the second the evening star.</p>  
 <p>Halaia's sister, Pahnino, in this myth became afterward a shell, or rather a creature which lives in a shell, as did also her mother. I do not know which kind of shell Pahnino is; it has bright colors.</p>  
 <p>The increase and decrease of food, the magic power of weapons, the jealousy and hostility of the husbands of other sisters, are usual in Yana myths of this kind.</p>
