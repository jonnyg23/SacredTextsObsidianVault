 <p>IN this, as in all Indian myths of the bringing of fire, it is procured by stealing. The pursuit in all cases is most strenuous.</p>  
 <p>In one myth relays are posted along the road at short intervals these deliver the fire to one another in great haste. At last the pursuers are very near, when the fire is given to him who afterward becomes the turtle; he places the treasure in his mouth and rolls into a deep river, where he hides till the baffled masters of fire turn homeward sorrowing.</p>
