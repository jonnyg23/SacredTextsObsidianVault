 <p>S*uwā'! <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">310</font></a> May you think about me to yourself! May you turn back to look! Would that I might stand before his face! I just cry to myself. Would that I might see him every day! I do just as you do. <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">311</font></a> Sometimes I dream of him, and I rise when it is daylight, and I look about. Now, as I see him, my heart flutters. I look at him without raising my eyes. He gives me trinkets, and I take them, and I wear them for some time, until they are worn out.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_134"></a><a href="yat19.htm#fr_138">198:310</a> Spells and more or less formulaic utterances in general are introduced by S*uwā', of unknown, if any, significance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_135"></a><a href="yat19.htm#fr_139">198:311</a> The implication is not clear. Perhaps it means, "May you love me as I love you!"</p>
