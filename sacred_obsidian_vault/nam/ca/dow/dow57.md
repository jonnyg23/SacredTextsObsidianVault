 <p><i>The Northern Mewuk say</i>:</p>  
 <p>The heart-spirits or Ghosts (<i>Soo-lek'-ko</i>) of good Indians turn into <i>Too-koo'-le</i> the Great Horned Owl; those of bad Indians into <i>Et-tā'-le</i> the Barn Owl, <i>Yu'-kal-loo</i> the Meadowlark, <i>O-lā'-choo</i> the Coyote, or <i>Choo'-moo-yah</i> the Gray Fox. <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">26</font></a> Whatever they turn into they continue to be forever--there is no change after that.</p>

 <p>NOTE. The Tribes of Midoo stock also believe in transmigration. <i>The No-to'-koi-yo</i> or Northeastern Midoo say that their ghosts go into the Great Horned Owl, while the <i>Pā'-we-nan</i> or Southwestern Midoo say that when a person dies his spirit (<i>oos</i>) may go into any one of a number of things: it may turn into an Owl or Coyote, a Snake or a Lizard; it may become a Whirlwind, or it may</p>
