 <p>AFTER <i>Wek'-wek</i> had sent his sister home he stayed near-the caves below <i>Koo-loo'-te</i> and dug holes in the sand and found roots and seeds that were good to eat. In digging he came to a very deep hole which led down under the world; he went down this hole and when he reached the underworld found other people there, and got a wife with a little boy. Besides his wife there were <i>To-to'-kon</i> the Sandhill Crane, <i>Wah'-ah</i> the Heron, <i>Cha-poo'-kah-lah</i> the Blackbird, and others.</p>  
 <p><i>To-to'-kon</i> the Sandhill Crane was chief. When he saw <i>Wek'-wek</i> he said, "What shall we do with this man; he is lost; we had better kill him."</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> saw a man make ready with his bow and arrow, and invited him to come and eat. The man came and ate, and when his belly was full went back.</p>  
 <p>Captain <i>To-to'-kon</i> said, "I didn't send you to eat, but to kill him." Then he sent another, and <i>Wek'-wek</i> asked him also to come and eat, and he did as the other had done. Then Captain <i>To-to'-kon</i> sent two men together to kill him, but <i>Wek'wek</i> called them both to come and eat) and they did so. Then <i>To-to'-kon</i> was angry; he sent no more</p>

 <p>men but went himself and took his bow and arrow. <i>Wek'-wek</i> said to him, "Come in," whereupon <i>To-to'-kon</i> shot his arrow but missed.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>Wek'-wek</i> came out and faced the people. They fired all their arrows but could not kill him. <i>Wek'-wek</i> said, "You can't kill me with arrows. Have you a pot big enough to hold me?"</p>  
 <p>"Yes," they answered.</p>  
 <p>"Then set it up and put me in it," he said.</p>  
 <p>And they did as they were told and put <i>Wek'wek</i> in the hot pot and put the cover on. When he was burned they took out the burnt bones and buried them in the ground.</p>  
 <p><i>Ah'-ut</i> the Crow missed his uncle and went to his uncle's partner, <i>Hoo-loo'-e</i>, who was in the hole crying, and asked where <i>Wek'-wek</i> was. <i>Hoo-loo'-e</i> pointed down the hole. <i>Ah'-ut</i> went down and found the rancheria of the underworld people and killed them all. He then asked <i>Wek'-wek's</i> wife where <i>Wek'-wek</i> was. She answered that the people had burned and buried him.</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> stayed in the ground five days and then came to life; he came out and asked his wife where the people were. She told him that <i>Ah'-ut</i> had come and killed them all. "That is too bad," he exclaimed, "I wanted to show them what kind of man I am." Then he said she should stay there and he would take the boy and go home.</p>  
 <p>She answered, "All right."</p>  
 <p>Then he shot his arrow up through the hole and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>caught hold of it, and held the boy also, and the arrow carried them both up to the upper world.</p>
