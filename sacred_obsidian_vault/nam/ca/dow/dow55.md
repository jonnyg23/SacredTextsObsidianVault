 <p><i>The Middle Mewuk of Tuolumne River say</i>:</p>  
 <p>When a person dies, <i>Oo'leus</i> the heart-spirit remains in the dead body for four days. During these four days everyone is quiet and the children are not allowed to run about or make a noise. On the morning of the fourth day the people sprinkle ashes on the ground over the buried basket of burnt bones--or over the grave if the corpse were buried instead of burned. On that day the heart spirit leaves the body in the invisible form of <i>Hinnan Soos</i> the Wind Spirit, or <i>Soo-les'-ko</i> the Ghost, and proceeds westward. That night it may come back in <i>Soo-koo'-me</i> the Owl, or in some other animal; so look out.</p>  
 <p>Some Ghosts are good, others bad. At last they all go to the ocean and cross over on a long pole to the Roundhouse of the dead, where they remain.</p>
