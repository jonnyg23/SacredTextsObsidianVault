 <p><i>The Middle Mewuk of Tuolumne River foothills say</i>:</p>  
 <p>When <i>Soo-koo'-me</i> the Great Horned Owl hoots, it means that someone is dying. He is himself the Ghosts of dead people. <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>[I was once asked by a Northern Mewuk if I had ever seen the broad belt of bony plates which surrounds the eyeball of the Great Horned Owl. On replying that I had, I was assured that these closely imbricating plates are the "finger nails all jammed tight together of the ghosts caught by the owl."]</p>
