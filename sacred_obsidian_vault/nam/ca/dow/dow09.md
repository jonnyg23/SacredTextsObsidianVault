 <p align="center">As told by the Chowchilla Mewuk</p>  
 <p>IN the long ago time the world was dark and there was no fire. The only light was the Morning, <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">8</font></a> and it was so far away in the high mountains of the east that the people could not see it; they lived in total darkness. The chief <i>We'-wis-sool</i>, the Golden Eagle, felt very badly because it was always dark and cried all the time.</p>  
 <p><i>Ah-hā'-le</i> the Coyote-man made up his mind to go and get the Morning in order that the people might have light. So he set out on the long journey to the east, up over the high mountains, saying, "I'm going to get the Morning."</p>  
 <p>Finally he came to <i>Ah-wahn'-dah</i> the Turtle. <i>Ah-wahn'-dah</i> was guardian of the Morning; he wore a big basket on his back. When <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> came close to <i>Ah-wahn'-dah</i> he was afraid something would catch him and carry him off. He said to himself, "I'm going to turn myself into a log of wood so I'll be too heavy to be carried off," and he turned into a big dry limb. <i>Ah-wahn'-dah</i> the Turtle put fire to the limb, but it would not burn; then he fell asleep.</p>

 <p>When the Guardian had gone to sleep <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> got up and said, "Now I'm going to get the Morning." So he changed back into his own form and put out his foot and touched the Morning, and it growled. He then caught hold of it and jumped quickly and ran away with it and brought it back to his people.</p>  
 <p>When he arrived he said to <i>We'-wis-sool</i> the Eagle, "How are you?"</p>  
 <p><i>We'-wis-sool</i> answered, "All right," but was still crying because it was dark.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> said, "Tomorrow morning it is going to be light," but <i>We'-wis-sool</i> did not believe him.</p>  
 <p>In the morning <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> gave the people the light. <i>We'-wis-sool</i> was very happy and asked <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> where he got it, and <i>Ah-hā'-le</i> told him. Then the people began to walk around and find things to eat, for now they could see.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_6"></a><a href="dow09.htm#fr_6">44:7</a> The word <i>We'-wis-sool</i> or <i>We'-wŭ-sool</i> is not of Mewan origin but is borrowed from the Yokut tribes immediately to the south--the Chuk-chan'-sy and Kosh-sho'-o. In the Mewuk language the Golden Eagle is called <i>We'-pi-ahk</i> or <i>We-pi-ah'-gah</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_7"></a><a href="dow09.htm#fr_7">45:8</a> Morning, in this story, is obviously synonymous with sun and light, and probably with fire also, as in the preceding story.</p>
