 <p>WEK'-WEK the Falcon-man and <i>O-lā'-nah</i> the Coyote-man lived a long time ago.</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> did not like <i>O-lā'-nah</i> because he was smart and always pretended that he could do everything. So one day <i>Wek'-wek</i> said to him, "Let's go and get wood; you are so smart and know so much and can do so many things, let's see you take that big oak tree and bring it home."</p>  
 <p><i>O-lā'-nah</i> answered, "All right, I can do it."</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> told him to go ahead and do it.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>O-lā'-nah</i> ran around and around the big oak tree and the roots cracked and made a noise, and the tree shook, but it did not fall; <i>O-lā'-nah</i> could not get it up; he made it shake four times but could not make it fall.</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i>, who was watching from the top of a sycamore tree, said, "Do that again; make the big oak tree shake again, the same as you did before, you are so strong."</p>  
 <p><i>O-lā'-nah</i> tried but could not do it.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>Wek'-wek</i> said: "What you said was not true; you bragged that you could do everything but</p>  
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></a></p>  
 <p>you can not do any thing; now I have beaten you, haven't I?"</p>  
 <p>"Yes," answered <i>O-lā'-nah</i>, "You have beaten me; I am going away." Then <i>O-lā'-nah</i> turned and howled as Coyotes howl and cried and said "<i>how-loo'-loo-e, how-loo'-loo-e, how-loo'-loo-e</i>," and turned into a real Coyote like the coyotes we have now. But he was angry and set upon <i>O-hul'-le</i>, his wife (<i>O-hul'-le</i> was the Badger-woman), and whipped her, and she ran away. <i>O-lā'-nah</i> followed and tried to hiring her back, but she refused and would not come.</p>  
 <p>After <i>Wek'-wek</i> had beaten <i>O-lā'-nah</i> he had to get fire. So he went up the Sacramento River to the place where trees grow, where the creeks come down from the mountains, and took a piece of wood and made a small hole in it and sprinkled in the hole some dry leaves of <i>Kutch'-um</i> the sage-herb, and took a stick of <i>Lap'-pah</i>, the elderberry tree, and whirled it between his hands, with one end in the hole in the wood, and fire came in the dry <i>Kutch'-um</i> leaves and he had fire.</p>
