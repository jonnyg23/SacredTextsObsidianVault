 <p>This is a collection of stories from the Isleta Pueblo people of New Mexico.
 Charles Lummis [1859-1928] was a pioneering writer,
 photographer, amateur anthropologist and adventurer who,
 according to himself, invented the term 'The Southwest'.
 In 1884, Lummis took a hike from Cincinnati to Los Angeles, which he later
 chronicled in his best-selling book, <i>A Tramp Across the Continent</i> (1892).
 In 1885, he became city editor for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and later
 covered the Apache wars in Arizona.
 In 1888, Lummis suffered a stroke.
 To convalesce, he moved to New Mexico, where he embedded himself in Pueblo
 culture and collected the stories in this book.
 This was originally
 published as <i>The Man Who Married the Moon</i> in 1894, and revised
 and enlarged as the present text in 1910.
 Lumis moved back to Los Angeles, where he made his home, <i>El Alisal</i>,
 and founded the Southwest Museum in 1914, at the foot of Mount Washington in
 East Los Angeles.
 He also helped restore the Spanish missions in California.
