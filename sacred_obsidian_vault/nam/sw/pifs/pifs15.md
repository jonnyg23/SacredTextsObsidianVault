 <h3 align="CENTER">THE COYOTE AND THE THUNDER-KNIFE</h3>
 <p>ANOTHER Isleta myth tells of an equally sad misadventure of the Coyote.</p>
 <p>Once upon a time an old Coyote-father took a walk away from home; for in that season of the year his babies were so peevish they would not let him sleep. It happened that a Locust was making pottery, under a tree; and every time she moved the molding-spoon around the soft clay jar, she sang a song. The Coyote, coming near and hearing, thought: "Now that is the very song I need to put my <i>óo-un</i> to sleep." And following the sound he came to the tree, and found Cheech-wée-deh at work. But she had stopped singing.</p>
 <p>"Locust-friend," said he, "come teach me that song, so that I can soothe my children to sleep." But the Locust did not move to answer; and he repeated:</p>
 <p>"Locust-friend, come teach me that song."</p>
 <p>Still she did not answer, and the Coyote, losing his patience, said:</p>
 <p>"Locust, if you don't teach me that song, I will eat you up!"</p>
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>
 <p>At that, the Locust showed him the song, and he sang with her until he knew how.</p>
 <p>"Now I know it, thank you," he said. "So I will go home and sing it to my children, and they will sleep."</p>
 <p>So he went. But as he came to a pool, halfway home, a flock of Afraids-of-the-Water <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">1</font></a> flew up at his very nose, and drove out his memory. He went looking around, turning over the stones and peeping in the grass; but he could not find the song anywhere. So he started back at last to get the Locust to teach him again.</p>
 <p>But while he was yet far, the Locust saw him, so she shed her skin, leaving a dry husk, as snakes do, and filled it with sand. Then she made it to sit up, and put the molding-spoon in its hands, and the clay jars in front of it; and she herself flew up into the tree.</p>
 <p>Coming, the Coyote said: "Friend Locust, show that song again; for I got scared, and the song was driven out of me." But there was no answer.</p>
 <p>"Hear, Locust! I will ask just once more; and if you do not show me the song, I'll swallow you!"</p>
 <p>Still she did not reply; and the Coyote, being angry, swallowed the stuffed skin, sand, spoon, and all, and started homeward, saying: "<i>Now</i> I think I have that song in me!"</p>
 <p>But when he was half-way home he stopped and struck himself, and said: "What a fool, truly! For now I am going home without a song. But if I had left the Locust alive, and bothered her long enough, she would have shown me. I think now <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>
 <p>I will take her out, to see if she will not sing for me."</p>
 <p>So he ran all around, hunting for a black thunder-knife, <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a> and singing:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p><font size="-1">Where can I find Shée-eh-fóon?<br>
 Where can I find Shée-eh-fóon?</font></p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>At last he found a large piece of the black-rock, and broke it until he got a knife. He made a mark on his breast with his finger, saying: "Here I will cut, and take her out."</p>
 <p>Then he cut. "Mercy!" said he, "but it bites!" He cut again, harder. "Goodness! but how it bites!" he cried, very loud. And cutting a third time, he fell down and died. So he did not learn the song of the pottery-making.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The Quères Pueblos have exactly the same folk-story, except that they make the Horned Toad, instead of the Locust, the music-teacher. In their version, the Horned Toad, after being swallowed, kills the Coyote by lifting its spines. Remembering what I have said of the maker of the thunder-knives, you will readily see the analogy between this and the obsidian splinter of the Tée-wahn story. It is, indeed, one of the most characteristic and instructive examples of the manner in which a folk-story becomes changed.</p>
