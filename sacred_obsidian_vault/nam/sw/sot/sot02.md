 <p>THIS LITTLE BOOK VOICES AN APPRECIATION OF THE ETHICS AND IDEALS OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN AS THESE ARE EXPRESSED IN HIS MOST ENDURING WORDS. I AM INDEBTED FOR ITS PUBLICATION AT THIS TIME TO THE EXPOSITION OF INDIAN TRIBAL ARTS INC., AN ORGANIZATION EFFECTED IN 1930 FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRESENTING THE ART OF THE FIRST AMERICANS AS FINE ART. ASIDE FROM EXPLANATORY COMMENT THE BOOK STANDS, THEN, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL EXHIBIT OF THE REDMAN'S AESTHETICS, GIVING EXAMPLES OF WOVEN AND COLORFUL PHRASES PROPER TO THE SPLENDID COMPANY OF HIS FINE TEXTILES, FINE CERAMICS AND EXQUISITE SIMPLICITIES IN PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.</p>  
 <p>NOW WHEN THE WHITE MAN'S INTRODUCED CIVILIZATION FALTERS BEFORE A GLUT OF FOOD AND A LAPSE OF ETHICS THE OLD AMERICAN CIVILIZATION OF PRE-COLUMBIAN DAYS HOLDS LESSONS NOT TO BE IGNORED. THE REDMAN'S SOCIAL RESTRAINTS KEPT THE RESOURCES OF THE NEW WORLD INTACT AGAINST OUR COMING. HIS DISTINGUISHED SKILL SET UP SOME OF THE BEST STANDARDS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP. HIS PATIENT HUSBANDRY WON FOR US OUR MOST IMPORTANT CROPS. BETTER STILL HE DEMONSTRATED THAT UPON A WISE USE OF LEISURE SAVED FROM THE PURSUIT OF FOOD AND MERE NECESSITIES REST THOSE INTELLECTUAL, ARTISTIC AND RELIGIOUS COMMONWEALTHS WHICH ARE THE CROWN AND GLORY OF MANKIND.</p>  
 <p>AFTER THE MANNER OF ANCIENT AMERICA OUR PRESENT SOCIETY SHOULD FIND AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF ITS MEMBERS ENGAGED IN CULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. YET TODAY, SUFFERING FROM TOO MUCH GOOD FORTUNE, WE CURTAIL ART, SCIENCE AND EDUCATION AND BEND EVERY EFFORT TO STIMULATE A SPENDTHRIFT DESTRUCTION OF NATURAL WEALTH IN THE NAME OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. OUR INDIANS OF THE PAST CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OF OUR SOCIAL PURPOSES.</p>
