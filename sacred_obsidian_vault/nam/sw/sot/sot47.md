 <p>Now round about I guess you are,<br> You enemy peoples of strange speech<br> Such as you O Utes, such as you, O Kiowas,<br> Such as you O Comanches, such as you O Cheyennes,<br> Such as you O Pawnees, where you are,<br> Such as you, O warring peoples all!</p>  
 <p>So now from here I think of you,<br> From here I call aloud your names,<br> With money to trade for your good work<br> Of aching backs and sweating brows.<br> And when your village we have reached,<br> And you have something not for sale,<br> Easily may it come into our hands!</p>  
 <p>That is what we wish and therefore<br> I speak now that this to us may happen!</p>
