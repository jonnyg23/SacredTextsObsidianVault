 <h3 align="CENTER">THE STORY OF NAHVAHCHOO</h3>
 <p>EE-EE-TOY was once wandering along when he found some moss that had been left there ever since the flood, and he stood and looked at it, wondering how he could make it into a human being. And while he watched it the sun breathed on it, and it became not a man, but a turtle.</p>
 <p>And he wandered on again and found some driftwood, and while he stood wondering how to make it into a human being, the sun breathed on it, and it became a man, but he could not see its face, which was covered as with a mask.</p>
 <p>And the turtle and the masked man, thus created, went westward, and came to a Blue Vahahkkee, and they went in and staid all night.</p>
 <p>In the morning, when the sun rose, they were frightened at the blue beams that shone thru the vahahkkee, and they left.</p>
 <p>And after going a little way they came to a Black Road, and Black Birds flew over them to keep them from being seen.</p>
 <p>And they came to a Black Night. In that night was a Black Bow, which stretched as if it were going to shoot them, so that they were afraid to lie down all night.</p>
 <p>And the next day they came to a Blue Road, and a flock of Blue Birds flew over them, and all around, striking them.</p>
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>
 <p>After a while they came to a Blue Night, and in the night was a Blue Bow, which stretched itself threateningly at them, as the Black Bow had done the night before.</p>
 <p>And they could not sleep for fear that night, either; and the next day they came to a White Road, and a flock of White Birds followed them, striking them.</p>
 <p>And they came to a White Night, and in that night was a White Bow, which threatened them as the others had done, so that again they could not sleep.</p>
 <p>And the next day they had a similar experience. only it was a Yellow Road, with Yellow Birds, and a Yellow Night with a Yellow Bow.</p>
 <p>The next day there was no danger any more, and they went on and came to a mountain, <i>Co-so-vah-taw-up-kih</i>, or Twisted Neck Mountain, and there the Nahvahchoo (masked man), having run ahead, left the turtle behind, and when evening came sat down and waited for the turtle to come up. But the turtle was too far behind, and when night came stopped where he was, and made a fire, and made corn and pumpkins, and roasted the corn and set the pumpkins around the fire, as the Indians do, to scorch them before putting them in the ashes.</p>
 <p>And Nahvahchoo heard the popping sound of the cooking, and came running back, and tried to steal a piece of the fire to have one of his own, but the turtle would net let him. And so the</p>
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Nahvahchoo went off and made a fire of his own, and corn and pumpkins of his own, and cooked them as the turtle had done.</p>
 <p>In the morning, after they had feasted on the pumpkin and corn, the turtle, <i>Wee-hee-kee-nee</i>, sank down and went under the earth to the ocean, and made that his home, and Nahvahchoo sank down and went in the same direction, but not so far, coming up on the sea shore.</p>
 <p>And Nahvahchoo went along the sea-shore, toward the east, till he came to a great deal of driftwood, and many flowers, and handled all these, and got their strength, and made his home in the east.</p>
 <p>One day Nahvahchoo heard the earth shaking, and ran out of his house to try and find where the shaking came from, and he went south and did not feel it, and went west and felt it a little, and went north and felt it more. And so he ran back and put on his mask, and took his bow, and went north. And the first time he stopped and listened he heard it somewhat, and the next time he heard it more, and the third time still more, and the fourth time he came to where many people were singing the song <i>Wah-hee-hee-vee</i>, and dancing the dance <i>Vee-pee-nim</i>, in which the dancers wear gourd masks, on their faces, pierced full of little holes to let the light thru.</p>
 <p>And they were dancing, too, the-dance <i>Kawk-spahk-kum</i>, in which the dancers wear a cloth mask, like Nahvahchoo, With a little gourd, full of holes, over the mouth-hole, to sing thru.</p>
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>
 <p>And they were dancing also the dance <i>Tawt-a-kum</i>, in which the dancer wears a bonnet of cloth, and a mask like Nahvahchoo does.</p>
 <p>And the people sitting around in these dances had little rods which they rubbed upon notched sticks, in time to the singing and the dancing.</p>
 <p>At first Nahvahchoo was greatly excited by all this dancing, for all these people seemed to do nothing else but sing and dance, and make the rods and notched sticks and stand them up in bunches; but after a few days he began to think of game, for he was a great hunter, and he went out and found the tracks of a deer.</p>
 <p>And measuring these with his arrow he laughed, covering his mouth with his hand, and said: "This deer will not run very fast, I could catch him myself." For a deer that measures a good way between his tracks is long-bodied, and cannot run fast, while a deer that measures short between tracks has a short body, and jumps quicker.</p>
 <p>And he followed the deer, which heard him coining, and began to run, end when Nahvahchoo saw by its tracks that it was running, he ran, too, and getting on a hill saw the dust of its running away off; and he ran after it, and when he came to the next hill it was close, and he ran down, and killed it, and took it back to the singers, and they fell ravenously upon it and ate it all up, not leaving him even the bones.</p>
 <p>Nahvahchoo sat off a little way and watched them, and one of their speakers addressed him,</p>
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>
 <p>and said: "We know you, who you are. You are a great doctor, and a great hunter, and a great farmer, and a powerful man every way. And maybe you expected us to join in your hunt and help you carry the game. But we want you to join us, and become a singer, and you will have plenty of corn and beans to eat, and you will find that such food will last, while, as you see, the game, when you bring it in, lasts but a little while."</p>
 <p>So Nahvahchoo staid with them and became a singer, and after a while the people told him to go to a certain vahahkkee, and said: "You will find something there with which you will be pleased. And then go to the opposite one, and you will find that with which you will be still more pleased.</p>
 <p>And one of these vahahkkees was called <i>See-pook</i> (Red-bird) Vahahkkee and the other was named <i>Wah-choo-kook-kee</i> (Oriole) Vahahkkee. But tho they told him to go to these they did not allow him to do so, but one day he slipped away, when they were not looking, and opened one, and saw in it many wonderful things, clouds forming and sprinkling all the time, and in the other it was the same.</p>
 <p>And one was covered with red flowers, and the other with yellow flowers, and where they came together the mingling of red and yellow was very pretty.</p>
 <p>At the door of each vahahkkee was a corn-mill.</p>
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> And he stole one of these and went west. But after a while he stopped and said: "I wonder what is going to happen, for the east is all green and the west is of the same color."</p>
 <p>But he ran on, and the clouds came over him, and it began to sprinkle, and then to rain, and then the water began to run, and get deeper and deeper, and he said: "This is happening to me because I stole this mill, but I am not going to let it go, I am going to keep it."</p>
 <p>And he ran on and came to where he had separated from Weeheekeenee, and went on and over Cosovahtawupkih, the Twisted Neck Mountain.</p>
 <p>And on that mountain he felt rather faint, and put his hand in his pouch and found a root and chewed it, the root <i>Cheek-kuh-pool-tak</i>, and breathed it out, and it stopped raining.</p>
 <p>And he went on to the Quojata Mountain, and sat there and took a smoke; and then on to Ahnnaykum; and then to Odchee, where he left the mill; and then to <i>Kee-ahk Toe-ahk</i>, where he also rested and took a smoke; and then he went home.</p>
 <p>And when Nahvahchoo arrived home he made a speech:</p>
 <p>"Where shall we hear the talk that will make us drunk and dizzy with the flowers of eloquence?</p>
 <p>There was near the water the driftwood lying, and from above the sun breathed down and a being was made.</p>
 <p>And it was the beautiful daybreak that I took and wiped its face with, and the remains of darkness that I painted its face with.</p>
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>
 <p>And there were all kinds of bird's feathers that I made a feather bonnet from.</p>
 <p>And there were joining wasps that came and flapped on the bonnet.</p>
 <p>And there were many butterflies that flapped their wings upon the bonnet, upon its feathers.</p>
 <p>And it was from the rainbow that I made its bow, and from the Milky Way that I made its arrow.</p>
 <p>From a red skin it was that I made its <i>saw-suh-buh</i>, to cover its arm for the bow-string not to injure it.</p>
 <p>And it was a red <i>kuess-kote</i> that I made and put in its hair to scratch with.</p>
 <p>And it was the gray fog that I fastened in its shoulders for its mantle.</p>
 <p>And the strong wind it was that I used for its girdle, around its waist.</p>
 <p>In the middle of the earth lay a square water moss, and the sun breathed on it and it turned into a creature, a turtle.</p>
 <p>And from there the Driftwood-Being went west with it.</p>
 <p>From there they went westward and watched the sun rise in the Blue Vahahkkee, and were frightened, and returned.</p>
 <p>From there they came to a Black Road, and Black Birds followed them, and to a Black Night wherein a Black Bow frightened them.</p>
 <p>And from there they came to a Blue Road, with Blue Birds following, and to a Blue Night with a Blue Bow to frighten them.</p>
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>
 <p>And from there they came to a White Road with White Birds following, and a White Night with a White Bow to threaten them.</p>
 <p>And the next day it was a Yellow Road and Yellow Birds, and after that a Yellow Night and a Yellow Bow.</p>
 <p>And there was a square water full of ice, and he went around it four times.</p>
 <p>And there he found Seepook Vahahkkee, with its red flowers, and Wahchookookkee Vahahkkee with its yellow flowers, and there he got the everlasting corn-mill, and went westward and strengthened himself four times.</p>
 <p>And as he went westward there came a wind which felt good and refreshed him, and pleasant clouds that sprinkled him with water, and then there was rain, and the rattling of running water, and he went on his road rejoicing.</p>
 <p>And he reached the Twisted Neck Mountain, and there he felt faint a little, and took from his pouch the root Cheekkuhpooltak, and chewed it, and breathed it out, and was refreshed and went on.</p>
 <p>And he refreshed himself four times and went on, and found Tonedum Vahahkkee, the Vahahkkee of Light, and there he gave his power to the people who were gathered together, and said: 'My relatives, I want you to think of this, that our country will be more beautiful and produce more, because you know our country will not hereafter be what it has been'."</p>
 <p>And he made another speech:</p>
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a></p>
 <p>"It was after the creation of the earth, and there was a mud vahahkkee, and inside of it lay a piece of wood burning at one end, and by it stood a cane-tube pipe, smoking, and we inhaled the smoke, and then we saw things clearer and talked about them.</p>
 <p>In the West there was a Black Mocking Bird, and from him I asked power, and he brought the news and spread it over all the earth, and to every' hill and every mountain and every tree, that the earth would stand still, but it did not, it still moved.</p>
 <p>(And you, Black Mocking Bird, take back your Black Winds, and your Black Clouds, and stay where you are, and your relatives may sometimes come to you for power.)</p>
 <p>And in the South there was a Blue Mocking Bird, and I asked it for power, and it stretched the news over all the earth, and over every hill and every mountain, and to every tree, that the earth stood still, but it did not, it still moved.</p>
 <p>In the East was a Mocking Bird of Light, and I asked it for power, and it stretched the news over all the earth, and to every hill, mountain and tree, that the earth stood still, but it still moved.</p>
 <p>And Above there was darkness, where lived the Feather Nested Doctor, who is famous for his power, and I asked him for power, and he spread the news, as the others had done, but the earth still moved.</p>
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>
 <p>And in the North lived a Yellow Spider, and I asked him for power, and he stretched his news, and made his web, and tied the earth up with it, and made a fringe like a blanket fringe at each corner, and laid his arrows over it.</p>
 <p>The fringe at the West corner he made black, and covered it with the Black Vahahkkee to hold it down; and he put the blue fringe at the South corner, and over it the Blue Vahahkkee to hold it down, and he put the black arrows over the Black Vahahkee, and the blue arrows over the Blue Vahahkee.</p>
 <p>And in the East he put the Vahahkee of Light over the fringe and the arrows of light over it.</p>
 <p>And after all this was done the earth stood still.</p>
 <p>And after this is done you are carried away like a child, and are set down facing the East, and your heart comes out towards it, and can be seen going up and down till it reaches it.</p>
 <p>And over the land your seed shall spring up and grow, and have good stalks and many flowers, and have good wide leaves and heads of good seeds.</p>
 <p>And after the seed is ripe they will take it and put it away and grind it with sunbeams, and the boys and girls shall eat and be happy, and all the old men and women shall eat it and lengthen their lives."</p>
