 <h3 align="CENTER">NOTES ON THE STORY OF NAHVAHCHOO</h3>
 <p>The story of Nahvahchoo was celebrated till lately among the Pimas by dancing games, resembling those described in this story, the players wearing masks and gourds, and rattling notched sticks, one of them impersonating Nahvahchoo himself.</p>
