 <h3 align="CENTER">THE LEGEND OF BLACKWATER</h3>
 <p>A little off from the road between Sacaton, and Casa Grande Ruins there is, or was in the old days, a mysterious pool of dark water, which the Indians regarded with superstitious awe.</p>
 <p>They said it was of fathomless depth, that it communicated with the ocean, and that strange, monstrous animals at times appeared in it. There are Indians still living who declare they have seen them with their own eyes.</p>
 <p>I visited this famous place once with my interpreter, Mr Wood. After galloping a while thru a mezquite forest we suddenly emerged upon its legendary shores Alas, for the prosaic quality of fact! It was but a commonplace water-hole, or spring-pond, a few rods across, with bogs and bulrushes in its center.</p>
 <p>The unkindness of irrigation ditches, withdrawing its waters, revealed that like most bottomless pools of story it was very shallow indeed.</p>
 <p>It was nearly dry.</p>
 <p>Its name of Blackwater has been given to the nearby <a href="errata.htm#40">surrounding</a> district.</p>
 <p>This was the only trace of the common Indian superstition of water monsters I found among the Pimas.</p>
