 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">West wind, blow from your prairie nest,<br> Blow from the mountains, blow from the west.<br> The sail is idle, the sailor too;<br> O! wind of the west, we wait for you.<br> Blow, blow!<br> I have wooed you so,<br> But never a favor you bestow.<br> You rock your cradle the hills between,<br> But scorn to notice my white lateen.  
 <p>I stow the sail, unship the mast:<br> I wooed you long but my wooing's past;<br> My paddle will lull you into rest.<br> O! drowsy wind of the drowsy west,<br> Sleep, sleep,<br> By your mountain steep,<br> Or down where the prairie grasses sweep!<br> Now fold in slumber your laggard wings,<br> For soft is the song my paddle sings.</p>  
 <p>August is laughing across the sky,<br> Laughing while paddle, canoe and I,<br> Drift, drift,</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Where the hills uplift<br> On either side of the current swift.<br> The river rolls in its rocky bed;<br> My paddle is plying its way ahead;<br> Dip, dip,<br> While the waters flip<br> In foam as over their breast we slip.  
 <p>And oh, the river runs swifter now;<br> The eddies circle about my bow.<br> Swirl, swirl!<br> How the ripples curl<br> In many a dangerous pool awhirl!</p>  
 <p>And forward far the rapids roar,<br> Fretting their margin for evermore.<br> Dash, dash,<br> With a mighty crash,<br> They seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.</p>  
 <p>Be strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe!<br> The reckless waves you must plunge into.<br> Reel, reel.<br> On your trembling keel,<br> But never a fear my craft will feel.</p>  
 <p>We've raced the rapid, we're far ahead!<br> The river slips through its silent bed.<br> Sway, sway,<br> As bubbles spray<br> And fall in tinkling tunes away.<br> And up on the hills against the sky,<br> A fir tree rocking its lullaby,<br> Swings, swings,<br> Its emerald wings,<br> Swelling the song that my paddle sings.</p></div>
