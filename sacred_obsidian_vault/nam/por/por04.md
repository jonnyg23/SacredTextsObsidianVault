 <p align="center"><b>THE MAN SINGS</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">My parents think they can separate me from the girl I love;<br> We have vowed to love each other while we live.<br> Their commands are vain: we shall see each other while the world lasts.<br> Yes! let them say or do what they like; we shall see each other while the rocks stand.</div>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE WOMAN SINGS</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Here I sit on this point, whence I can see the man that I love.<br> Our people think that they can sever us; but I shall see him while the world lasts.<br> Here shall I remain, in sight of the one I love.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Now I am left on this lonely island to die—<br> No one to hear the sound of my voice.<br> Who will bury me when I die?<br> Who will sing my death-song?</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">My false friends leave me here to die alone;<br> Like a wild beast, I am left on this island to die.<br> I wish the wind spirit would carry my cry to my love!<br> My love is swift as the deer; he would speed through the<br>     forest to find me.<br> Now I am left on this lonely island to die.<br> I wish the wind spirit would carry my cry to my love!<br> My love is as swift as the deer; he would speed through the<br>     forest to find me;<br> Now I am left on this lonely island to die.<br> I wish the spirit of air would carry my breath to my love.<br> My love's canoe, like sunlight, would shoot through the water<br>     to my side;<br> But I am left on this lonely island to die, with no one to pity<br>     me but the little birds.<br> My love is brave and strong; but, when he hears my fate, his<br>     heart will break.<br> And I am on this lonely island to die.<br> Now the night comes on, and all is silent but the owl.<br> He sings a mournful song to his mate, in pity for me.<br> I will try to sleep.<br> I wish the night spirit to hear my song; he will tell my love of<br>     my fate; and when I awake, I shall see the one I love.<br> I am on this lonely island to die.</div>

 <p align="center"><b>HER LOVER SEES HER IN A DREAM AND, GOING TO SEARCH FOR HER, SINGS</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Come, my beloved, let us go up that shining mountain, and<br>     sit together on that shining mountain; there we will watch<br>     the Sun go down in beauty from that shining place.<br> There we will sit, till the Night Traveler arises in beauty<br>     about the shining mountain; we will watch him as he<br>     climbs to the beautiful skies.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">We will also watch the little Stars following their chief.<br> We will also watch the Northern Lights playing their game of<br>     ball in their cold, glistening country.<br> There we will sit, on the beautiful mountain, and listen to the<br>     Thunder beating his drum.<br> We will see the flashes from the lit pipe of the Lightning.<br> We will see the great Whirlwind race with Squall.<br> There we will sit, until all creatures drowse.<br> There we will hear the great Owl sing his usual song: "Go-to-<br>     sleep-all," and see all animals obey his call.<br> There we will sit in beauty on the mountain, and watch the<br>     small Stars in their sleepless flight.<br> They do not mind the song, "go-to-sleep-all"; neither will we<br>     mind it, but sit more closely together, and think of<br>     nothing but ourselves, on the beautiful mountain.<br> Again, the "go-to-sleep-all" will be heard, and the Night<br>     Traveler will come closer to warn us that all are sleeping,<br>     except ourselves and the little Stars.<br> They and their chief are coursing along, and our minds go<br>     with them.<br> Then the Owl sleeps; no more is heard "go-to-sleep-all";<br>     the Lightnings flash afar; the great pipe is going out; the<br>     Thunder ceases beating his drum; and though our bodies<br>     urge us to be sleeping, we sit in beauty still upon the<br>     shining mountain.</div>
