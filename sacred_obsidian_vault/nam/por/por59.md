 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">What shall I sing to thee, Babe on my back?<br> Song of the Eagle that mates with the storm!<br> Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!<br> The wild gale is weeping, driven before him<br> To his nest on the black lone mast of the night;<br> Swinging, swinging, far out, high out, over the sea!<br> Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!<br> Thy father is Eagle-Go-High, chief of thy tribe:<br> Fiercest in war, wisest in council, swiftest in hunting,<br> Harshest and fondest in the tent of his woman;<br> He is my mate!  
 <p>What shall I sing to thee, Babe on my back!<br> Song of the wind that is wanton forever!<br> Fleeing forever, luring and weeping, laughing and leaping forever;<br> Calling forever—calling—for the chase of swift wings,<br> For the drive and the smite of wild wings,<br> For the fold of strong wings,<br> For the sleep in warm wings.<br> OO-o-roo-o-rrr-ufffff-oo! Thy mother is Storm-Dancer, daughter of Winds.<br> What art thou, Little Chiefling, babe of my heart?</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The star that I plucked from the mast of the night,<br> When the wings of thy father outstrove me.<br> Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!<br> Eagle-Go-High, this is thy son,—<br> He falls asleep, smiling,<br> To the scream of thy nesting-call.<br> Hi-i-ri-i-ki! Ri-i-ki! Ri-eek!</div>
