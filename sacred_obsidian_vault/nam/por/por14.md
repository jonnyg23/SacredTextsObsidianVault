 <p>After the rushing waters had subsided<br> The Lenâpé of the Turtle were close together,<br> In hollow houses, living together there.<br> It freezes where they abode:<br> It snows where they abode:<br> It storms where they abode:<br> It is cold where they abode.<br> At this northern place they speak favorably<br> Of mild, cool lands<br> With many deer and buffaloes.<br> As they journeyed, some being strong,<br> Some being rich, they separated<br> Into house-builders and hunters:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the north:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the east:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the south:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the west.<br> In that ancient country, in that northern country,<br> In that Turtle country<br> The best of Lenâpé were the Turtle-men.<br> All the cabin fires of that land were disquieted<br> And all said, "Let us go."</p>

 <p>To the Snake land, to the east, they went<br> Going away, earnestly grieving.<br> Split asunder, weak, trembling, their land burned<br> They went, torn and broken, to Snake Island.<br> Those from the north being free, without care<br> Went forth from the land of snow in different directions.<br> The fathers of the Bald Eagle and the White Wolf remain<br> Along the sea, rich in fish and strength.<br> Floating up stream in their canoes<br> Our fathers were rich, they were in the light<br> When they were at those islands.<br> Head Beaver and Big Bird said:<br> "Let us go to Snake Island," they said.<br> All say they will go along<br> To destroy all the land.<br> Those of the north agreed,<br> Those of the east agreed,<br> Over the sea, the frozen sea,<br> They went to enjoy it.<br> On the wonderful slippery water,<br> On the stone-hard water all went,<br> On the great tidal sea, the muscle-bearing sea.<br> Ten thousand at night,<br> All in one night,<br> To the Snake Island, to the east, at night,<br> They walk and walk, all of them.<br> The men from the north, the east, the south:<br> The Eagle clan, the Beaver clan, the Wolf clan,<br> The best men, the rich men, the head men,<br> Those with wives, those with daughters, those with dogs.<br> They all come, they tarry at the land of the spruce-pines:<br> Those from the west come without hesitation,<br> Esteeming highly their old home at the Turtle land.<br> There was no rain and no corn<br> So they moved further seaward.<br> At the place of caves, in the Buffalo land,<br> They at last had food on a pleasant plain.</p>
