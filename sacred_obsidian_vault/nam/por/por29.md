 <p>"Tell me," I asked an Indian song-poet who had just taught me a song of his composing, "when you made your song, which came first, words or music?"</p>  
 <p>The Indian stared at me in puzzled surprise: "I made a song," he answered, "a song is words and music—all comes together."</p>  
 <p>Because Indian poems are therefore really songs, conceived as a very part of the iteration and intonation of music, I have endeavored in my translations to hold in minutest detail to the original rhythm and accent, believing that only thus can the Indian verse sing, through an alien tongue, in its true form.</p>
