 <p>    Here's good wind, here's sweet wind,<br> Here's good wind and my woman calls me!<br> Straight she stands there by the pine-tree,<br> Faithful waits she by the cedar,<br> She will smile and reach her hands<br> When she sees my thousand salmon!<br> Here's good wind and my woman calls me.</p>  
 <p>    Here's clear water, here's swift water,<br> Here's bright water and my woman waits me!<br> She will call me from the sea's mouth—<br> Sweet her pine-bed when the morning<br> Lights my canoe and the river ends!<br> Here's good wind, here's swift water,<br> Strong as love when my woman calls me!</p>
