 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    Death's first snows are drifting on my cheek,<br> Pale are my lips<br> As the kiss of Cin-Uza;<br> I lie low and still.<br> Near me crouch my silent kinsmen,<br> They hold the breath and wait the hour of wailing;<br> They have wrapped the scarlet mourning blanket<br> Round the shoulders of the oldest man;<br> He has taken their sorrow.<br> He droops at my door<br> Like a bleeding hawk where the eagles have battled.<br> He is so old he feels not any grief,<br> His heart is cold,<br> In his ears no sound is,<br> And in his eyes no light.<br> Therefore have my kinsmen given him their griefs—<br> Because the dawn leaps clear into their eyes,<br> Because the sound of women's feet<br> Rustling on the cedar mats when the torch is blown<br> Calls sweetly to their ears,<br> And their hearts are beating for the hunt.<br> They may not bear the sorrow of my passing,<br> We have known strong joys together!</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    I take your loves, my kinsmen,<br> I leave; with you no griefs!<br> Sing, my kinsmen, when ye swing me<br> To the topmost branches of the cedar.<br> Sweet-smelling arms of cedar, reach for me,<br> Tenderly receive me,<br> Hold me in the Last Caress under open sky!<br> Sing, my kinsmen, when the oldest man<br> Takes his lone trail through the forest.<br> He will wear no mourning-blanket when he comes again tomorrow!<br> He will say, "Rejoice—<br> I have borne your grief afar,<br> I have buried it deep,<br> The place is not known."<br> The wind of your singing shall rock me<br> In the arms of my mother, the cedar.<br> Yet there is a sweeter song, my kinsmen;<br> It is the Change-Song of Supreme One.<br> I hear it now,<br> He chants it to my heart;<br> Because pale death has crossed my threshold, and has clasped my hand.<br> "Fear not," sings Supreme One;<br> "I am making pure, making pure,<br> I destroy not life,<br> I am Life-maker!"</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    The oldest man has entered the forest,<br> Ah! Ah! my kinsmen are wailing;<br> They saw me depart with Death<br> Into the White Change.<br> But I go on—and on!<br> And I sing the Change-Song of Supreme One:<br> <i>Ha-eohos la no-ya ai-a me la-la<br> Q’ oalahag’ i-h-e-e la-wo!</i></div>
