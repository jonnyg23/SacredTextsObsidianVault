 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Plem-Salia-Kwi is the Hunter returning with plenty,<br> And the Fisher from the green sea.<br> His shoulders are heavy with deer's meat;<br> His great canoe is slow with salmon.<br> We listen to the nudge of its tall ghost-prow<br> In all our landing coves.<br> We hear the ground-wind of his moccasins<br> Rustling the forest-floors:<br> Swifter than joy they speed on the purple paths of the Fall—<br> Paths stained with fruitage, oozing odors.<br> He comes to us, his little brown blood-brothers by the sea:—<br> Through the dark silver-blue spruces, and the massed sea-green cedars,<br> Through the brown and crimson maples,<br> And the cottonwoods' dropping gold;<br> Through the pearl shimmer of the naked birches.<br> Plem-Salia-Kwi's blanket is the white, broidered, mist;<br> Its fringes are dew-bells<br> That tinkle little whispers down the mountain.<br> While he still slept,<br> Lake-Woman, Mother of Waters, wove him his blanket:<br> Wove it of the wool of the mist-herds<br> Drifting down from the cloud-ranges.<br> She patterned it in bead-drops, sun-colored—<br> A rainbow starts in the heart of each—<br> With blue ravelings from sky-patches,<br> With pink shells from the beaches of morning.<br> He bears the strong bent bow of the hills,<br> And the swift wind-arrows scarlet-shafted with dawn:<br> And the tall spear of falling light,<br> October light, the mystical weapon.<br> (Ah-h! Ahi! Ah-h! We sing to Kunaë<br> For the beauty and harvest of Plem-Salia-Kwi.)</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The little children,<br> In laughing, leaping, running, stumbling,<br> Pattering and creeping down to the beaches,<br> Give thanks for the harvest of sweet, dried berries<br> And the plenty of the breast.<br> They go down to converse with the swallows,<br> Who bathe in the small leaf-locked pools.<br> Ak-hi! the shrill joy of the children,<br> At the twirring and flashing of brown wings in bright water,<br> And the twittering of news from all the nests of the sea-coast!  
 <p>The pine-logs make a good smoke, blue, clear, sweet-smelling,<br> The cooking baskets bubble with water:<br> The women chant, while they heat stones for the baking,<br> Concerning the large baskets of food they have cooked,<br> And the racks of crimson, smoked salmon,<br> And the many trays of dried berries,<br> Sun-baked and jellied in long strips, packed in cool leaves.<br> They behold their men coming up from the caves<br> With hammers and copper, with silver and cunning shells;<br> And they clatter at their ears, saying:—<br> "Is not thy roof fragrant with cedar-trays of berries?<br> Have I not stored thy house full?<br> Hast thou not a little wayward son of thee at each of thy hands?<br> Is the cradle on my back—the cradle of thy despised little daughter—empty?<br> Where is another such wife?<br> Speak, O thou Hunter of Life,<br> That caughtest me unknowing in the pine shadows—<br> Ak-hi-i! Il-ak-il-ak!—<br> When I danced after Tem-Eyos-Kwi!"</p>  
 <p>The men answer not:<br> But in their eyes, behind their lashes, is a little smile,<br> Like light in the depths of a reedy pool.</p></div>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Early, ere their clattering women woke,<br> They went down to the caves with their axes.<br> They have digged copper and silver and brilliant shells<br> From a secret store.<br> Tink-tonk, tink-tonk, tink-tonk!<br> Through the forest rings the song of their hammers.<br> The silent men are hammering rings for their women:<br> Rings, bracelets, anklets, for their women,<br> Glad gifts for their women, their mates.  
 <p>For the silent men have seen<br> That Plem-Salia-Kwi walks not alone.<br> Through all his paths She follows him—his Woman, his Mate—<br> Sharing his blanket.<br> She has no other garment, her breast is bare,<br> She has given all to him she follows;<br> So comes he with plenty!<br> He tires not forever on his leagues of march,<br> Because her feet are set to his foot-prints,<br> And the gleam of her bare hand slants across his shoulder.<br> Therefore the silent men, the Hunters and Providers of Life,<br> Greet Plem-Salia-Kwi, the Harvest-Bringer, their Blood-Brother the Mated One,<br> With the tink-tonk, tink-tonk, tink-tonk of bright hammers,<br> Shaping gifts for their women:<br> Ringing their thanksgiving song for full joys—<br> Full baskets, full cradles, the full arms of sleep.</p></div>
