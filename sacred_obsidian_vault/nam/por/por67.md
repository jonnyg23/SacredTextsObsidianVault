 <p align="center"><b>FROM THE PAIUTE</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Now all my singing Dreams are gone<br> But none knows where they are fled<br> Nor by what trail they have left me.  
 <p>Return, O Dreams of my heart,<br> And sing in the summer twilight,<br> By the creek and the almond thicket<br> And the field that is bordered with lupins!</p>  
 <p>Now is my refuge to seek<br> In the hollow of friendly shoulders,<br> Since the singing is stopped in my pulse<br> And the earth and the sky refuse me;<br> Now must I hold by the eyes of a friend<br> When the high white stars are unfriendly.</p>  
 <p>Over sweet is the refuge of trusting;<br> Return and sing, O my Dreams,<br> In the dewy and palpitant pastures,<br> Till the love of living awakes<br> And the strength of the hills to uphold me.</p></div>
