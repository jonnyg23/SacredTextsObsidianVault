 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    In the dawn I gathered cedar-boughs<br> For the plaiting of thy whip.<br> They were wet with sweet drops;<br> They still thought of the night.<br>     All alone I shredded cedar-boughs,<br> Green boughs in the pale light,<br> Where the morning meets the sea,<br> And the great mountain stops.<br>     Earth was very still.  
 <p>    I heard no sound but the whisper of my knife,<br> My black flint knife.<br> It whispered among the white strands of the cedar,<br> Whispered in parting the sweet cords for thy whip.<br> O sweet-smelling juice of cedar—<br> Life-ooze of love!<br> My knife drips:<br> Its whisper is the only sound in all the world!</p>  
 <p>    Finer than young sea-lions' hairs<br> Are my cedar-strands:<br> They are fine as little roots deep down.<br> (O little roots of cedar<br> Far, far under the bosom of Tsa-Kumts!—<br> They have plaited her through with love.)<br> Now, into my love-gift<br> Closely, strongly, I will weave them—<br> Little strands of pain!</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Since I saw thee<br> Standing with thy torch in my doorway,<br> Their little roots are deep in me.  
 <p>    In the dawn I gathered cedar-boughs:<br> Sweet, sweet was their odor,<br> They were wet with tears.<br> The sweetness will not leave my hands,<br> No, not in salt sea-washings:<br> Tears will not wash away sweetness.<br> I shall have sweet hands for thy service.</p>  
 <p>    (Ah—sometimes—thou wilt be gentle?<br> Little roots of pain are deep, deep in me<br> Since I saw thee standing in my doorway.)</p>  
 <p>    I have quenched thy torch—<br> I have plaited thy whip.<br> I am thy Woman!</p></div>
