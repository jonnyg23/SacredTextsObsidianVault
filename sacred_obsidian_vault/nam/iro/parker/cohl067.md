 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"This happened when Gai'wiio` was new. It was the time when he dwelt at Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê`. <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>"A father and son appeared in Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê`. Now the name of the son was Gani'seoñ. They were on a hunting journey and came from Gadäges'käo<sup>n</sup> <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">2</font></a> with a horse and cart. Now they tarried in Diono<sup>n</sup>?'sodegê` for several nights before again taking up their journey.</p>
 <p>"It was during the hunting season that the news spread that some one had returned from the hunting grounds without a companion. It was the young man who had returned. So they questioned him and asked where his father was. He answered, 'My father is lost. I went about searching for my father a number of days. I walked and searched and signalled with gun discharges hoping to find him. I could not find him and became weary waiting for his return.' So he said."</p>

One of these things will move though not touched and he shall be the witness.' So the head men did as bidden and placed the objects as directed. In the middle of the floor they spread a blanket and put the articles upon it. Then they gathered around it and watched, and as they watched he spoke and the bullet moved. Thus it happened. Then spoke Ganio`dai'io`, 'This brings the confirmation of the rumor. Truly the youth has murdered his father, and furthermore I say that the crime was committed between Ga:nos' <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">3</font></a> and Hanênk'gaek. <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">4</font></a> On the south side of a mountain, where half way up an elm is broken, leaning over on the downhill side to the west lies the body buried in the leaves of the top branches.
