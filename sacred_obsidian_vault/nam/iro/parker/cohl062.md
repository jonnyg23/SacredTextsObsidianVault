 <p>"'Now another message to tell your people.</p>
 <p>"'The messengers have given the promise to the prophet that he will be able to judge diseases and prescribe remedies. <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a> So also he will be able to see far down into the earth as far as runs the elm's root. Then if any trouble comes and anyone asks the help of the prophet, he must give it freely, but they who ask must give an offering of tobacco. Now there will be some in your care who will be taken from your hands for other treatment. No wrong will be done and you must bear no ill will. It is said that the events of all our days are foreknown, so when the time comes for you to exercise your power we will tell you and then you may judge the earth and cure diseases.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
