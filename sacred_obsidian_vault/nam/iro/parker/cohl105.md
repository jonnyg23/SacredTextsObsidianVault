 <p>"So they proceeded on their journey and it happened that a vision appeared unto them. They seemed to be advancing toward an approaching man. Soon they met him and passed. Now when they were a distance apart they turned and he was facing them. So they greeted each other. Then said the man, 'Sedwa:go'wanê, I must ask you a question. Did you never hear your grandfathers say that once there was a certain man upon the earth across the great waters who was slain by his own people?' That was what he said when he spoke.</p>
 <p>"Then answered Sedwa:go'wanê, 'It is true. I have heard my grandparents say this.'</p>
 <p>"Then answered the man, 'I am he.' (Sega<sup>n</sup>'hedûs He who resurrects). And he turned his palms upward and they were scarred and his feet were likewise and his breast was pierced by a spear wound. It appeared that his hands and his feet were torn by iron nails.</p>
 <p>"All this was true. It could be seen and blood was fresh upon him.</p>

 <p>will all the people cry to me for succor, and when I come it will be in this wise: my face will be sober and I shall turn it to my people. Now let me ask how your people receive your teachings.'</p>
 <p>"He answered, 'It is my opinion that half my people are inclined to believe in me.'</p>
 <p>"Then answered he, 'You are more successful than I for some believe in you but none in me. I am inclined to believe that in the end it will also be so with you. Now it is rumored that you are but a talker with spirits (djîs'gä<sup>n</sup>dâtâha` <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a>). Now it is true that I am a spirit and the one of him who was murdered. Now tell your people that they will become lost when they follow the ways of the white man.'"</p>
 <p>So that is what he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
