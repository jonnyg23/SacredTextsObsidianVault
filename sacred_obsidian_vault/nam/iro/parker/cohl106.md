 <p>"So they proceeded on their journey and had not gone far when they came to a halt.</p>
 <p>"Then the messengers pointed out a certain spot and said, 'Watch attentively,' and beheld a man carrying loads of dirt and depositing them in a certain spot. He carried the earth in' a wheelbarrow and his task was a hard one. Then he knew that the name of the man was Sagoyewat'ha, a chief.</p>
 <p>"Then asked the messengers, 'What did you see?</p>
 <p>"He answered, 'I beheld a man carrying dirt in a wheelbarrow and that man had a laborious task. His name was Sagoyewat'ha, a chief.'</p>
 <p>"Then answered the messengers, 'You have spoken truly. Sagoyewat'ha is the name of the man who carries the dirt. It is true that his work is laborious and this is for a punishment for he was the one who first gave his consent to the sale of Indian reservations. It is said that there is hardship for those who part with their lands for money or trade. So now you have seen the doom of those who repent not. Their eternity will be one of punishment.'" <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="cohl106.htm#fr_83">68:2</a> The followers of the Gai'wiio` to this day mention the name of Red Jacket with contempt. While they acknowledge his mental superiority they have no other admiration for him. He was ever the enemy of Cornplanter and Ganiodaiio with whom he had frequent collision and recognized the sachem prophet only as an impostor. The teachings of Ganiodaiio have done much to prejudice the Iroquois against Red Jacket.</p>
