 <h3 align="CENTER">THE STRANGE DEATH OF THE SICK MAN</h3>
 <p>Now at this time the daughter of the sick man and her husband are sitting outside the house in the shed and the sick man is within alone. The door is ajar. Now the daughter and her husband are cleaning beans for the planting. Suddenly they hear the sick man exclaim, "Niio?!" <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">3</font></a> Then they hear him rising in his bed and they think how he is but yellow skin and dried bones from four years of sickness in bed. Now they hear him walking over the floor toward the door. Then the daughter looks up and sees her father coming out of doors. He totters and she rises quickly to catch him but he falls dying. Now they lift him up and carry him back within the house and dress him for burial.</p>
 <p>Now he is dead.</p>
