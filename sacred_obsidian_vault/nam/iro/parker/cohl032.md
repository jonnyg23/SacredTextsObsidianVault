 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'Now this is right.</p>
 <p>"'When a woman hears children playing near her lodge she must call them in and ask them to eat. The Creator says that this is right for some children are of poor parents and have little to eat. The Creator loves poor children and whosoever feeds the poor and unfortunate does right before him.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
