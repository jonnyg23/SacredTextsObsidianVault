 <p>"'Now another message for your people.</p>
 <p>"'Now when my relatives heard all this they said, 'This man must be a clairvoyant (hênne'yo<sup>n</sup>?). <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">2</font></a>"</p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>"The news spread and Gaiänt'wakâ came as a messenger. <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a> Now he came to Ganiodai'io` and said, 'Why, having the assurance of powers, do you not commence now. Come prophesy!' Now he had tobacco for an offering. Then he said, 'My daughter is very sick.'</p>
 <p>"Now the diviner of mysteries did not respond to his entreaty and so Gaiänt'wakâ went out but soon came running back. This second time he had the same request and plead more earnestly, but without avail.</p>
 <p>"Then it was said that he would not respond to the cry of a brother and had no hearing for the voice of a brother.</p>
 <p>"Again Gaiänt'wakâ returned and urged his brother.</p>
 <p>"Now the people said, 'Have we not something to say to you as well as the messengers of the Creator?'</p>
 <p>"Then he answered and said, 'Truly the people say that I will not reason. Verily I am true to my words. Now I can do nothing but try but I have not yet the permission of the messengers.'</p>
 <p>"Now he went into a deep sleep and when he awoke he told his vision. Now he said that O?gi'we <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">2</font></a> should be sung for the sick woman.</p>
 <p>"Now it is said that at that time the first song was in order but every part of the song was silent.</p>
 <p>"Now a rumor spread that after all it was not wrong to continue the ceremonial dances once forbidden. So many were sick because they had not observed the commanded method of closing the societies."</p>
 <p>This was so when Gai'wiio` was new. Eniaiehuk.</p>
