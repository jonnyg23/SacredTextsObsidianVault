 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'Now it is said that your fathers of old never reached the true lands of our Creator nor did they ever enter the house of the tormentor, Ganos'ge?. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> It is said that in some matters they did the will of the Creator and that in others they did not. They did both good and bad and none was either good or bad. They are therefore in a place separate and unknown to us, we think, enjoying themselves.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
