 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="cohl048.htm#fr_41">43:1</a> These deer are the sacred creations of the Great Ruler and as such no "pale invader" is permitted to see them, though a few of the faithful have at certain seasons seen them in the darkness fleeing from discovery. Cornplanter says these deer were killed by a jealous rival of the prophet while he yet lived, so defying the new command.</p>
