 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'Tell your people that the Creator is sad because of what they are doing.</p>
 <p>"'Some people live together well as man and wife and family, but the man of the family uses strong drink. Then when he comes home he lifts up his child to fondle it and he is drunk. Now we, the messengers of the Creator, say that this is not right for if a man filled with strong drink touches his child he burns its blood. Tell your people to heed this warning.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
