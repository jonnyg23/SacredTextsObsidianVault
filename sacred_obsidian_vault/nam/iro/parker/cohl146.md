 <p>I</p>
 <p>1 Dä'nondinônnio`' Êde:`kwa gää'kwa`, the Sun dance, is designed to honor the sun.</p>
 <p>2 This ceremony has no certain time for its celebration but may be called by anyone, at any time, who dreams it necessary for the welfare of the settlement.</p>
 <p>3 The ceremony begins at noon when arrows are shot up toward the sun while the populace shout their war cries.</p>
 <p>4 A fire is built outside and tobacco is thrown by a priest who chants the sun-rite.</p>
 <p>5 Three times during this ceremony a shower of arrows are shot up to the sun accompanied by a chorus of cries, intended to notify him that they are addressing him.</p>
 <p>6 Immediately afterward the Osto'wägowa is engaged in as the only fitting dance to perform before the mighty Sun.</p>
 <p>II</p>
 <p>1 Dä'nondinônnio`' Soi'ka gää'kwa`, the Moon Dance ceremony, is convened by anyone who dreams it necessary or by the advice of a clairvoyant.</p>

 <p>2 A thanksgiving speech is recited by a chief while he burns the tobacco offering to the moon.</p>
 <p>3 As the peach stone gambling game is thought especially pleasing to the moon, the company gambles away the evening.</p>
 <p>4 The distribution of the feast terminates the ceremony.</p>
 <p>III</p>
 <p>1 Wasaze, the Thunder Dance, is one designed to please the spirit of Thunder, Hi?'no<sup>n</sup>.</p>
 <p>2 A council is called when the first thunder of the year is heard and a time as immediate as possible set for the Wasaze.</p>
 <p>3 The dancers assemble without the council house, an opening address is made by a priest or chief and the dance immediately starts.</p>
 <p>4 The line of dancers dance into the long house.</p>
 <p>5 Hi?'no<sup>n</sup> is supposed to delight in war songs and these are sung to please him.</p>
 <p>6 Tobacco is burned and a thanksgiving speech made to Hi?'no<sup>n</sup>, for his services in the past and he is prayed to continue his favors.</p>
