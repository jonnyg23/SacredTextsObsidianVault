 <p>"In a loud voice the punisher cried to a certain person saying, 'Come hither.' The punisher held a drinking vessel in his hand and within it was molten metal and thrusting it in the hands of the man he had called he said, 'Now warm yourself again as was your custom while on the earth for you loved hot drink.' Now the man pleaded but the punisher compelled him to swallow the molten metal. Then the man screamed in a loud voice and fell prone upon the ground with vapor steaming from his throat. Now he cried no more.</p>
 <p>"Then said the four messengers, 'You have seen the manner of punishing those who persist in taking the fiery drink.'</p>
 <p>So they said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
