 <p>"'Now another message to tell your people.</p>
 <p>1 "'Now we are of the mind that the cold of winter will take life away. Many will be taken away because of the changing cold. Moreover some will freeze because they are filled with strong drink. Then again when the earth grows warm and the warm changes come, many will perish because of strong drink. Now the Creator never intended that variations of weather and season, warm and cold, should cause death.'"</p>
 <p>2 "'The Creator made the waters of the earth, the rivers and lakes. These too will cause death and some filled with strong drink will be swallowed up by the waters.'"</p>
 <p>3 "'And now more. The Creator made fire and this will also cause death and some filled with strong drink will be destroyed by the flames.'"</p>
 <p>"'Verily he has said and ordained that they who disobey Gai'wiio` should fall into hardships.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
