 <p>"Now he saw a certain nude woman coming out from a crowd and in all the hair of her body were writhing serpents. Her cheeks were parched to the bone where she had been wont to color them and likewise where her hair was parted there was no flesh. Now she was greatly ashamed but she could not cover her nakedness. So in this condition he saw her.</p>
 <p>"Then said the four messengers, 'Saw thou that woman? In life she was wont to give on'oityi'yênde, [secret powders] to men to attract them to her. So you have seen the punishment meted out to those who do this and do not repent.'</p>
 <p>So they said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
