 <h3 align="CENTER">102. THE SEA-LION HUNT</h3>
 <p>A canoe [load of people] came behind the sea lions at Cape Ommaney. And they camped behind them. In the morning they went out to the sea-lion island. They sharpened limbs on the ends to make the sea lions sneeze and pushed them into their noses. In that way they killed off all the sea lions.</p>
