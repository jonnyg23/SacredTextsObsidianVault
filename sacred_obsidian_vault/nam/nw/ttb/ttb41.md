 <p>This Totem Pole was the personal property of Charlie James (Yak-U-Las) master carver and; story-teller of the Kwakiutl Indians who live along the inlets adjacent to Alert Bay, British Columbia. The fourteen different symbols on the pole represent the secret societies to which he belonged—some were inherited, others he acquired through marriage or by giving potlatches (feasts). Behind each one there is a legend of the tribe's ancestors, the Myth People.</p>  
 <p>This talented Indian artist extended the arts of the tribes by his design, some of which have been used to illustrate this book. The originals were first painted on spruce boards and cottonwood veneer. Eight of the former now hang on the wall of the Lipsett Memorial at Hastings Park Exhibition Grounds and eight adorn the Vancouver City Museum. A twelve foot Thunderbird totem pole and some others were carved by Mr. James for the author of this work through the years of their friendship.</p>
