 <h1 align="CENTER">THE STONE AND THE ELDERBERRY BUSH</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">[Told by Moses]</p>
 <p>A little before the Stone gave birth to her child, the Elderberry Bush gave birth to her children. For that reason the Indians do not live many years. Because the Elderberry Bush gave birth to her children first, man dies quickly. If the Stone had first given birth to her children, this would not be so. Thus say the Indians. That is the story of the Elderberry Bush's children. The Indians are much troubled because the Stone did not give birth to her children first, for this is the reason that men die quickly.</p>
