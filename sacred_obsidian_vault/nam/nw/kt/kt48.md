 <p>Then (Greedy-One) looked about again where to get food. Greedy-One became hungry. Then he lay down on the beach. Hë, hë, I am sick, I am sick!" he said. "Come, take pity on this sick one!" Thus he said to Salmon. The Salmon came and jumped on his back. Then Greedy-One clubbed the Salmon and ate it.</p>
