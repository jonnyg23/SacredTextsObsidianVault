 <p align="CENTER">Tradition of Sî'sEnLê?, a Clan of the Nimkish.</p>
 <p>?nEmô'gwis travelled northward, coming from Seymour Narrows. He made war upon the people and destroyed many villages. Finally he went up Nimkish River, and came to the mountain Ts!Ex*ê'wak<sup>u</sup>. There he acquired supernatural power. A goose (nEla') came to live with him, assumed the form of a person, and became the ancestor of his tribe. They lived in Foundation (<u>X</u>ulk<sup>u</sup>). When the goose assumed the shape of a person, his wife also became a human being, and they had many children. They came to be a bad people. ?nEmô'gwis and the goose are the ancestors of the Sî'sEnLê?.</p>
 <p>?nEmx*â'likô is also given as the name of the ancestors of the Sî'sEnLê?.</p>
