 <p align="CENTER">(Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês, 1900.)</p>
 <p>He saw a salmon jumping. "Hayû'!" He said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I should come and jump inside of this tide-ripple." Then it came and jumped. Again he said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump outside of this kelp." Then it jumped there. Again he said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump in the middle of this kelp." It came and jumped. Again he said, Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump on the land side of this kelp." It came and jumped. Then again he said, "Hayû'! If I should jump, I should jump almost on the rocks."</p>
