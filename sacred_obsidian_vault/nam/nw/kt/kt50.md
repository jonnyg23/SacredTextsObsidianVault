 <p align="CENTER">(Dictated by Q!ô'mg*ilis, a ?naqE'mg*ilisala, 1894.)</p>
 <p>Then Ô'?mâ<strike>l</strike> started and asked the Grave, "Are there no twins (here)?" Thus he said. (The Grave replied,) "That one far away from me."--"Are there no twins among you?" Thus he said. (The Grave replied,) "We are twins."--"Come, let me marry you!" said Ô'?mâ<strike>l</strike> to them. Then he started with the one who had been buried. He married her. (The woman said,) "Come dip water, that I may wash my hands in it." Then she washed her hands. "Go on, and pour it into the water!" Thus she said to a child. Then (the child) poured it into the water. Then one salmon jumped up [and became a salmon]. Day came, and she washed her hands. Then (the water) was poured out into the sea, and two salmon were jumping. Then she told her tribe to go ahead and make a salmon-weir. The salmon-weir was finished. Then they obtained the salmon. There were many salmon, it is said. They dried the salmon. Ô'?mâ<strike>l</strike> went, and the backbone of the drying salmon hooked the top of his head. They stuck on his head. Then he scolded. "You hook on, you who come from the ghosts." Thus he said to them. Then the salmon went, and nothing was left in the house. He had spoiled it.</p>
