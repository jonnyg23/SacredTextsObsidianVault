 Stith Thompson, a Distinguished Professor of English
 and Folklore at Indiana University, anthologized these
 Native American tales from the ethnographic literature.
 His chief contribution to the field was his 'Motif-Index of
 Folk Literature', which is a cross-cultural index of themes
 that occur in folktales.</p>
 <p>
 Reading through the traditional folk stories of
 <a href="../../afr/index.htm">Africa</a>,
 <a href="../../neu/index.htm">Europe</a>,
 and 
 <a href="../../nam/index.htm">Native America</a>,
 it becomes obvious
 that there are a broad set of motifs that are appear
 across geographic boundaries.
 Is this evidence of diffusion or something buried deeper in our
 cultural matrix that goes back to our common origins?
 This is still a mystery.</p>
 <p>
 Stories where virtue is rewarded, evil step-relations plot
 against the rightful heir, anthropomorphic animals play
 out very human dramas, and so on, soon blur together.
 There are also stories with violent, brutal, bawdy or transgressive
 sexual elements.
 Not all folklore is suitable for children!</p>
 <p>
 Westerners have been schooled by Shakespeare and TV sitcoms
 to expect that all stories will conclude
 in the final act with all of the loose ends tied up.
 This isn't always the case in the dream-like landscape of the folktale.</p>
 <p>
 Some folklore stories seem to go nowhere, or end
 in a conclusion that seems unsatisfying, or have
 repetitive episodes that appear to be added just to fill out
 the story.
 In modern literature, a story must either be
 a tragedy or a comedy; most folklore has elements of both.
 Folklore often violates our modern expectations
 of how a story should be shaped, while keeping us riveted,
 wanting to hear more.
 In this way folklore is much closer to real life, where 'stuff' happens,
 at random and often without any apparent internal logic.</p>
 <p>
 Stith Thompson's contribution was to attempt to make sense of
 this mass of material.
 This seminal book, which appears on the Internet for the
 first time at Sacred Texts, is his take on the Native American
 folklore corpus.</p>

 This text is believed to be in the public domain in the United States.
 The book was originally published in 1929, and was not renewed
 in a timely fashion (per the <a href="https://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ccer/ccer.htm">Catalog of Copyright Renewals</a>).
 Hence it entered the public domain in 1957.
 This is reflected in the Midland paperback edition of 1966,
 which bears no copyright notice.  The text was scanned from the
 Midland paperback edition.
