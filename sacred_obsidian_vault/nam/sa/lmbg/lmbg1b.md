 Would pass us in their light canoe,<br>

 And there—while no sweet breeze above<br>
 Would stir the leaves and cheer the grove,<br>
 And water-lilies scarce could move—<br>
  Would wait the cool of day.<br></td></tr>

 Though helped by signs with head or hand!<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Time passed: he heard in his own tongue<br>
 Truths which to Christian faith belong.<br>

 And I from him their legends heard,<br>

 Of spirits good and bad he told;<br>
 Of sorcerers and warriors bold;<br>
 But chief, <i>this</i> legend, grave and old,<br>
  Of <i>HIM</i> who all things made.<br></td></tr>

 <h5 align="center">NOTE TO ARAWIDI.</h5>
 
 <p> One apparent object of the great chain of legends, to which this belongs, was to give a mythical origin to the peculiarities of the various animals of Guiana, in connection with the deeds of the heroic personages of their national folk-lore.</p>
 
 <p> In the foregoing tale of Arawidi, those of the <i>alligator's</i> personal
 
 <!------------------------page 29------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a>
 
 appearance are accounted for. In other legends, those of monkeys, jaguars, &amp;c., were treated of. The fragmentary tale of the "Royal Vultures," of which the following outline was told to the writer by the Arawâks of Tapacuma, will show how they dealt with <i>birds</i>—real or fictitious.</p>
 
 <p> "A bold young Arawâk hunter captures a beautiful royal vulture. She is the daughter of Anuanima, sovereign of a race which has its country above the sky. When at home there, they cease to be birds, and assume the form and habits of <i>human beings</i>. The captive, smitten with love for her handsome captor, lays aside her feathers, and appears before him as a beautiful girl. She becomes his wife, bears him above the clouds, and, after much trouble, persuades her father and family to receive him. All then goes well, until he expresses a wish to visit his aged mother, when they discard him, and set him on the top of a very high tree, the trunk of which is covered with formidable prickles. He appeals pathetically to all the living creatures around. Then spiders spin cords to help him, and fluttering birds ease his descent, so that at last he reaches the ground in safety."</p>
 
 <p> Then follow his efforts, extending over several years, to regain his wife, whom he tenderly loves. "Her family seek to destroy him, but by his strength and sagacity he is victorious in every encounter. The birds at length espouse his cause, assemble their forces, and bear him as their commander above the sky. He is at last slain by a valiant young warrior, resembling himself in person and features. It is <i>his own son</i>, born after his expulsion from the upper regions, and brought up there in ignorance of his father."</p>
 
 <p> The legend ends with the conflagration of the house of the royal vultures, who, "hemmed in by crowds of hostile birds, are unable to use their wings, and forced to fight and die in their human forms."</p>
 
 <p> The peculiarities of various birds common to the country are, in the episodes of this wild legend, whimsically accounted for. The following are instances:—</p>
 
 <p> The "kiskedee," though a valiant little bird, disliked the war, and bandaged his head with white cotton, pretending to be sick.
 
 <!------------------------page 30------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a>
 
 Being detected by more resolute warriors, as the hawk, &amp;c., he was sentenced to wear the bandage continually. In time it marked his plumage; and the white band is still conspicuous on the heads of his descendants, They are also noted for their hostility to hawks and other large birds, whom they attack incessantly when on the wing.</p>
 
 <p> The "warracobba" (trumpeter bird) and another quarrelled over the spoil, and knocked each other over into the ashes of the burnt house. The trumpeter arose with <i>patches of grey</i>, which are still seen on the plumage of his children. The other bird, which had been <i>rolled</i> in the ashes, became <i>grey all over</i>.</p>
 
 <p> The <i>owl</i> round among the spoil a package, done up with great care, which he thought would enrich him for life. It was a magical package, prepared by the foe for some emergency, and containing <i>darkness</i>. The darkness enveloped him as he opened it, and he has never since been able to endure the light of day!</p>
 
 <p> Thus—often whimsical and puerile, but displaying much fertility and boldness of invention, with here and there touches of romantic beauty—were the mythical tales of the Arawâk race in the days of yore. When the piai system began slowly to fade before Christianity, those legends, in their pure and connected shape, were no longer preserved. Their few remaining fragments are now distorted, intermixed, and in no two districts told alike.</p>

 They who oppressed our fathers here from Orinoco came,<br>
 Through Barima and Waiini, as we those rivers name.<br>
 Each year their painted warriors came, each year those rivers swept;<br>
 Poor captive women paddled them; and as they worked they wept.<br>
 Long time the Waraus, who lived there, their stern oppression felt;<br>
 Until they fled to "ita" swamps, where more secure they dwelt.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>The Caribs wasted all that land; then said, "We'll plunder find,<br>
 In those parts where Morūca and its tributaries wind."<br>
 They came; but war canoes, too large, could not from Waiini pass:<br>
 Too little water was there then to float them through the grass.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"O friends! ere next wet season comes we must for them prepare!"<br>

 To save their wives and children dear from violence and wrong.<br></td></tr>

 So to the river down they went, and there the captain made<br>
 A massive log of heavy wood, which in the stream he laid.<br>
 He fixed it tightly in each bank; the spot we now can show—<br>
 Just <i>there</i>—it near the surface crossed—not two hands'-breadth below.<br></td></tr>

 Slow winding through those narrow streams, came paddling along.<br></td></tr>

 As if yon Waramūri hill hurled back the hateful sound.<br>
 Onward they race until their "chase" is seen to disappear<br>
 Up this small stream; and, without pause, the Caribs enter here.<br>
 And here they have to wind about beneath the trees so high;<br>
 Yet still they onward rush and shout, nor think an ambush nigh.<br>
 The small craft slackens speed at length—it is not understood—<br>
 But they tear on with all their strength, and <i>strike the sunken wood</i>.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>That first canoe is broken: overthrown are all her crew!<br>
 And as they rise, with savage cries, keen arrows strike them through.<br>
 Their comrades hasten at their cry, that they may help afford;<br>

 Until we drew our foes again into an ambuscade.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Again we won the victory, again o'erthrew our foes,<br>
 As each side fought with deadly hate, no cry for mercy rose.<br>
 One champion on our side there was, Bohirasiri named<br>
 (In old times oft his praise was heard, for in our songs he's famed);<br>
 The Carib chieftain in the face with three-pronged shaft he shot;<br>
 Struck down his warriors all around, and dragged him from the spot.<br>
 The barbéd weapon from his face the wounded chieftain tore;<br>
 But cruel was the gash it made, and he could fight no more.<br></td></tr>

 <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a>
 
 <br>
 So warriors and elders grave in council met next day,<br>
 Where the old chieftain, wounded sore, was asked what he could say.<br>
 "Oh why have rou, these many years, vexed cruelly this land?"<br>
 To which he could no answer give, as most may understand.<br>
 But <i>this</i> he said, "Lo, here I stand!—Arise, some one, and slay!<br>
 I'm in your power. But if you spare, and let me go away,<br>
 My people all will grateful be, and, for their leader's sake,<br>
 Will not again invade your land, but peace for ever make."<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Our race is not bloodthirsty. They resolved, our old men say,<br>
 To take the Carib at his word, and let him go away.<br>
 Four of his men alone still lived, they were with him set free;<br>
 And their old chief the promise kept, which gained his liberty.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Perhaps those Orinoco Caribs found our swampy land<br>
 Was not so easy, as it seemed, to ravage and command;<br>
 Perhaps they learned what men can do who slaves will never be:<br>
 Rememb'ring, too, that o'er picked men we'd gained the victory!<br>
 But still that act of clemency, we think, availed us more<br>
 Than if we'd slain ten thousand warriors on that bloody shore.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Whatever cause may be assigned, we found their inroads cease,<br>
 And since those fights, of which I tell, this region has had peace.<br></td></tr>
