 <h1 align="CENTER">ZUÑI RITUAL POETRY</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">By RUTH L. BUNZEL</h3>
 <h2 align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF PRAYER</h3>
 <p>Spoken prayer in Zuñi is called t?ewusu p?ena:we, "prayer talk." This includes personal prayers, all the set prayers of rituals, chants, the origin myth in its ritual forms, the "talk" of komosono and other set speeches. It is also used for urgent requests. (t?ewusu p?eye?a--" he speaks prayers, i. e., begs, implores.")</p>
 <p>Prayer is never the spontaneous outpouring of the overburdened soul; it is more nearly a repetition of magical formulae. A good deal has already been said (p. 493) about the rôle of prayer in the ritual. The prayers constitute the very heart of a ceremony. Like fetishes, they are sacred and powerful in themselves. Their possession is a source of power; their loss or impairment a great danger. Zuñis will describe esoteric ceremonies fully and vividly, but there are two thing which they are equally reluctant to do--to exhibit sacred objects or to repeat the words of a prayer. There is much less reticence about songs, except for a few special, secret songs. Prayer frequently forms part of set rituals. Then whether publicly declaimed or muttered so as to be inaudible to profane ears, the efficacy of the prayer depends in no small measure on its correct rendition. The prayers for individual use, such as accompany offerings of prayer meal, food, or prayer sticks, requests for medical service, etc., are also fixed in form and content, although they are individually varied in degree of elaboration. "Some men who are smart, talk a long time, but some are just like babies." There are certain other occasions on which men can display their skill in handling the poetic medium when they are visited in their houses by the katcinas; when they are called upon to take part in the games of the Koyemci; when they are appointed to office; or otherwise signaled out for honor or blessing by the supernaturals. In such cases one must improvise quickly and handle correctly the ritual vocabulary, rhythms, characteristic long periods, and, above all, speak without any hesitation or fumbling and for as long as possible. There is no time limit, no admonitions to be brief and to the point.</p>
 <p>{p. 616}</p>
 <p>The set prayers must be formally learned--they are not just picked up. The most formal instruction is that connected with the transmission of the prayers of the Ca?lako. Each kiva has a Ca?lako wo?le, who, among his other duties, keeps the prayers. Immediately after the winter solstice the Ca?lako appointees come to him to be taught the necessary prayers. The wo?le meets with them for the four nights following each planting of prayer sticks, and as often besides as may be necessary. The Saiyataca party, whose ritual is the most elaborate, meets every night. Most of this time is given to the "long talk," the litany that is declaimed in the house of the host on the night of their final ceremonies. There are many other prayers that accompany all their activities-prayers for the making and planting of prayer sticks, for getting their mask from the people who keep it and returning it, for various stages in dressing and in their progress toward the village, for the dedication of the house, for blessing the food, for thanking the singers and the hosts, for going away. How ever, the "long talk" and the "morning talk" are chanted aloud in unison and must be letter perfect. The method of instruction is for the wo?le to intone the prayer, the pupils joining in as they can. One-half of the chant is taken each night. The phraseology of the prayers is so stereotyped that the principal difficulty in learning a long prayer is to keep the sequence. For this purpose certain cult groups have special mnemonic devices. The K^äklo "talk" recorded in text by Mrs. Stevenson is such a record. It is an outline naming in order the various personages called and the places visited, it being assumed that the performer can fill in the outline from his knowledge of the poetic forms. It takes the men appointed to impersonate the gods all of the year to learn their prayers. As the time for the ceremony approaches great concern is felt, and sometimes the ceremony is postponed because the men are not ready. On the night after the ceremony the men go once again to the wo?le and give the prayer back. They recite it for him. At the close he inhales, and they do not, and so he takes from them the spirit of the prayer.</p>
 <p>The instruction in prayers that are not publicly performed is less formal. Boys learn the a, b, c's of religious participation, including elementary prayers, from their fathers. After initiation into a medicine society a man goes at once to his ceremonial father to learn to make the prayer sticks of the society, and at the same time learn prayers for the making and offering of prayer sticks. He makes some payment to his father for this information--a shirt or a headband or a few pieces of turquoise. Women do not make their own prayer sticks, but they go similarly to their "fathers" to learn the required prayers. So every additional bit of knowledge is acquired. As more esoteric information is sought, the expense for instruction increases</p>
 <p>{p. 617}</p>
 <p>greatly. A certain old man in one of the priesthoods knew a particular prayer and the order of events in a rarely performed ceremony. He refused to teach these things to anyone. When he was very old and his death was expected his colleagues wished to learn this prayer from him. He was finally persuaded to teach them for a consideration. The woman member of the priesthood contributed a woman's shawl, the men things of greater value, to his fee. He taught the prayer but withheld the other information, and finally died without communicating it. Sometimes a man who is apt and curious and wealthy may collect prayers, the way men in other societies accumulate oil paintings or other works of art, and eventually turn them to profit. The cost of most information is not so excessive that a poor man can not, with the practice of a little thrift, acquire whatever he wishes to know.[1] He can, if he wishes, and if he has friends, learn the prayers of the Ne?we:kwe without actually joining their society. His ceremonial affiliations restrict his right to use these prayers, but many men go to expense to learn prayers they have no intention of using. The Saiyataca texts recorded in the following pages and many others were given me by a man who had never impersonated Saiyataca and never expected to. They were verified after the informant's death by the Saiyataca wo?le, who wondered how and why the informant had learned them. I myself heard the actual chant twice after recording the text and know it to be correct.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">ZUÑI POETIC STYLE</h3>
 <p>As might be expected, prayers are highly formalized in content and mode of expression. Nearly all prayers are requests accompanying offerings. They have three sections, which always appear in the same order: A statement of the occasion, a description of the offering, and the request. In long and important prayers the statement of the occasion is a synoptic review of ritual acts leading up to the present moment of a ceremony. Thus, Saiyataca's chant begins with a description of the winter solstice ceremony when the appointment was made and follows the Saiyataca party through all the minor ceremonies of the year, even enumerating the various shrines at which prayer sticks were offered. The prayers over novices at their initiation ceremony begin with a formal description of their illness and cure. In prayers which do not mark the culmination of long ceremonies the statement of the occasion may be no more than a statement of the time of day or the season of the year, and some veiled allusion to the special deities who are being invoked.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. In Zuñi a "poor man" is one who has no special knowledge or position in the ceremonial system. A "valuable" man has knowledge and prestige. "Knowledge" (anikwanan:e) is the word for supernatural power.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 618}</p>
 <p>There is always a formal request for all the regular blessings--long life, old age, rain, seeds, fecundity, riches, power, and "strong spirit." This formal request closes the prayer. Any special request, such as those for summer storms and winter snows, safety in war, rescue from disease, precede this. Requests that are strictly personal never figure in prayer. One prays always for "all good fortune," never for special and particular benefit. The only exceptions are in the case of prayers in sickness and the prayer of a widower to his dead wife with the request that she should not pursue him.</p>
 <p>Zuñi prayers are distinctly matter of fact. They deal with external events and conditions rather than inner states. Outside of the request, their content is limited to two fields: Natural phenomena, such as sunrise, sunset, dawn, night, the change of seasons, the phases of the moon, rainstorms, snowfall, the growth of corn; and ritual acts, especially the making of prayer sticks, setting up of altars, and transfer of authority. Rituals of a more intimate and personal character, such as fasting and abstinence, are never mentioned. In their prayers Zuñis do not humble themselves before the supernatural; they bargain with it.</p>
 <p>There are regular stereotyped phrases for all things commonly alluded to in prayer. The sun always "comes out standing to his sacred place," "night priests draw their dark curtain," the corn plants "stretch out their hands to all directions calling for rain," the meal painting on an altar is always "our house of massed clouds," prayer sticks are "clothed in our grandfather, turkey's, robe of cloud." Events are always described in terms of these stereotypes, which are often highly imaginative and poetic.[2] These fixed metaphors are the outstanding feature of Zuñi poetic style. There are not very many of them; they are used over and over again, the same imagery appearing repeatedly in one prayer. A prayer recorded by Cushing more than 50 years ago contains all of the same stereotypes and no turns of expression different from those in use to-day. A comparison of Cushing's texts[3] with mine shows a rigidity of style in oral tradition.</p>
 <p>The sentence structure is that of continued narrative in the hands of a particularly able story-teller. Zuñi is a language that is very sensitive to skillful handling. Oratory is a recognized art, and prayer is one of the occasions on which oratory is used. The best prayers run to long periods-the longer the better, since clarity of expression is not necessary, nor particularly desirable.</p>
 <p>Zuñi, like Latin, is a highly inflected language and can handle effectively involved sentences that can not be managed intelligibly in</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[2. Some of the most striking passages have been quoted. (See pp. 483-486.).</p>
 <p>3. Unfortunately Cushing has published only short texts which do not do justice to Zuñi style. One long text which he recorded is to be published in the Journal of American Folk-Lore with a parallel modern version.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 619}</p>
 <p>English. These features, which are difficult enough of translation in prose, are emphasized in the poetry. The long period is a characteristic feature. The typical Zuñi word order is subject, object, verb; the verb always holding the final position. The usual method of expressing temporal or causal subordination is by means of participial or gerundive clauses, fully inflected, preceding the principal proposition. These participial clauses are impossible in English. In the translation it has been necessary, therefore, to break up the original sentences. Thereby an important and effective stylistic feature is unavoidably lost. But the reader should think of the Zuñi sentences rolling on like the periods of a Ciceronian oration to their final close.</p>
 <p>Another difficulty of translation, which will be alluded to frequently in the following pages, is the impossibility of translating the word plays with which the texts abound. To quote one example: The root lhea: means, in its intransitive inflection, to wear or hold in the hand; in its transitive inflection, to clothe or to give into the hand. There the sentence li:lh ho? t?o? telik^inan a:lhea?u means both, "I here hand you these prayer sticks," or "I clothe you with these prayer sticks." Folk tales and religious beliefs utilize this double entendre. It is believed, for instance, that when people neglect to plant prayer sticks to the gods their clothing wears out. The passage where the word cipololon:e is used with the double meaning of "smoke" and "mist" is a striking example. The suppliant offers smoke of the sacred cigarette to the rain makers. They are conceived as taking the cigarette and smoking in turn. They "send forth their smoky breath," i. e., mist or fog.</p>
 <p>Word play is used with still greater subtlety in the description of the prayer-stick offering. Many Zuñi roots are neutral; i. e., can be inflected to form both nouns and verbs.[4] ikwi: is to tie something about something else; ikwin:e, literally a tying about, is the usual word for belt. To say, therefore, "I tie the cotton about it," is precisely the same as to say "I belt him with a cotton belt." So the whole image of the making of the prayer stick or the dressing of an idol is built up linguistically. It is very difficult to tell how much is word play, how much metaphor, and how much is actual personification. The Zuñi finds these ambiguities intriguing.</p>
 <p>This leads us to the third form of word play, the deliberate use of ambiguity, both verbal and grammatical. There are passages where subject and object are deliberately confounded, although there are excellent means for avoiding such ambiguity. These sentences are perfectly grammatical and can be correctly interpreted in two ways.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[4. This is not, strictly speaking, true in precisely these terms. As a matter of fact these stems are probably verbal, but a complete demonstration of their character would take us into linguistic subtleties beyond the scope of this paper.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 620}</p>
 <p>The use of obsolete or special words has occasioned some difficulty. The expression k^?acima t?apela for ladder is one case. Tapela, the Zuñis say, is an "old word" for ladder. T?apelan:e, however, was a load of wood tied up as it used to be in the days when wood was brought on foot. Wood is no longer brought in this way, but the word, fixed in metaphor, has survived. There are a number of similar examples. In such cases the old translation has been retained.</p>
 <p>It has been impossible, of course, to render the original rhythm. One characteristic feature, however, has been retained, namely, its irregularity, the unsymmetrical alternation of long and short lines. Cushing, in his commendable desire to render Zuñi verse into vivid and intelligible English verse, committed the inexcusable blunder of reducing the Zuñi line to regular short-line rhymed English stanzas. If one were to choose a familiar English verse form it should be the line of Milton or, better still, the free verse of the King James version of the psalms. I have tried to retain the sense in the original of the fluidity and variety of the verse form. In reading the translations one must be mindful of Zuñi methods of declamation. The short lines are declaimed slowly and with marked emphasis, the long lines are spoken rapidly, unaccented syllables are slurred or elided, and the word accents pile up on each other. The two types of line are like the booming of the surf and the rushing of the brook.</p>
 <p>Zuñi poetry has no feminine endings.[5] The heavy accent with noticeable lengthening on the final syllable can not be transferred to English. The translation therefore suffers greatly from loss of sonority and vigor. In the original every line is like the declaration of a creed--an effect which no translation can adequately render. It is interesting to note that although the natural cadence of Zuñi is trochaic, the poetic rhythm is predominantly iambic. The principal word accent in Zuñi is invariably on the first syllable, with a secondary accent, in words of four or more syllables, on the penult. The final syllable is always unaccented, yet the important poetic stress is always on the final syllable of the line, which gives the verse a curious syncopated quality, very difficult of reproduction. The final syllable is usually distinguished by prolongation and a high falling tone.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[5. Every line ends in a vowel. Most Zuñi words terminate in vowels, but words ending in consonants--for example, the participles in -nan and -ap take special forms -na or -nana and -ap?!a when occurring finally; -a is the most usual vocalic ending, but there is no true rhyming.]</p>

 <h1 align="CENTER">I. PRAYERS TO THE ANCIENTS</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">AN OFFERING OF FOOD TO THE ANCESTORS</h2>
 <p>The offering of food to the dead forms an important part of Zuñi household ritual. Cushing states that a bit of food is offered in the fire at each meal by all partaking, and that no child is weaned until he is able to make this offering with a suitable prayer. At the present time the practice is by no means universal. It is made, with very little ceremony, by priests and the female heads of their houses. The female heads of houses holding ceremonial objects make offerings to these objects before serving food. Each appointee to ceremonial office makes offerings at nightfall in the river, about a mile west of Zuñi. The food thus offered is carried by the river to the supernaturals at the village of the masked gods. Offerings of food are conspicuous at any ceremonial meal, and each man holding ceremonial office receives a package to be offered later in the river. With offerings in the house no prayer is spoken-at most only a few words are mumbled: "Eat; may our roads be fulfilled," or "May we be blessed with life. " With outdoor offerings, long prayers are spoken. Offerings, whether of food, corn meal, or prayer sticks, are never made specifically to one's own ancestors, but to <i>the</i> ancestors.</p>
 <p>After the crops are harvested in fall ghosts' day or grandmothers' day is announced by the sakisti (sacristan of the ancient mission church).[2] On this day large quantities of food are prepared, only products of that year's harvest being used, a lamb of that spring's lambing, bread made of new wheat and corn, and anything else that has been raised. The melons are gone by that time, but some are always saved for the grandmothers. Before eating the evening meal women make their offerings in the fire, a few ears of corn, a dish of lamb stew, a loaf of bread, a roll of paper bread. After dark the men take even greater quantities to the river. The following prayer is used, probably, with this special offering.</p>
 <p>This day my children,<br>
 For their fathers,<br>
 Their ancestors,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[3. In 1927 it fell on November 9. For the probable Catholic origin of the feast in All Souls' Day, see Parsons All Souls' Day at Zuñi, Acoma, and Laguna; Journal of American Folk Lore 30:495.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 622}</p>
 <p>5 For you who have attained the far off place of waters,[3]<br>
 This day<br>
 My children<br>
 Have prepared food for your rite.<br>
 10 Now our sun father<br>
 Has gone in to sit down at his sacred place.[4]<br>
 Taking the food my children have prepared at their fireplaces<br>
 (I have come out.)<br>
 15 Those who hold our roads,[5]<br>
 The night priests,[6]<br>
 Coming out rising to their sacred place<br>
 Will pass us on our roads.<br>
 20 This night<br>
 I add to your hearts.<br>
 With your supernatural wisdom<br>
 You will add to your hearts,<br>
 Let none of you be missing<br>
 25 But all add to your hearts.<br>
 Thus on all sides you will talk together.<br>
 From where you stay quietly<br>
 Your little wind-blown clouds,<br>
 Your fine wisps of cloud,<br>
 30 Your massed clouds you will send<br>
 forth to sit down with us;<br>
 With your fine rain caressing the earth,<br>
 With all your waters<br>
 You will pass to us on our roads.<br>
 With your great pile of waters,<br>
 35 With your fine rain caressing the earth,<br>
 With your heavy rain caressing the earth,<br>
 You will pass to us on our roads.<br>
 My fathers,<br>
 Add to your hearts.<br>
 40 Your waters,<br>
 Your seeds,<br>
 Your long life,[7]<br>
 Your old age<br>
 You will grant to us.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[3. That is, the dead.</p>
 <p>4. The sun has two resting places: One above, to which he "comes out standing" at sunrise; one below the world, to which he "goes in to sit down" at sunset.</p>

 <p>6. That is the night itself, anthropomorphically envisaged.</p>
 <p>7. Onaya:nak^ä--literally "road fulfilling."]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 623}</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">THE PREPARATION OF PRAYER STICKS AT THE WINTER SOLSTICE</h2>
 <p>Twice during the winter solstice ceremony each adult male makes prayer sticks. The first time he makes for himself offerings to the sun, and to the ancestors. For the grown women of the family he makes offerings for the moon and the ancestors; children offer to the ancestors. If he is a member of a society he makes the special offering appropriate to his rank in the society. These solstice offerings are quite different from monthly society offerings.</p>
 <p>The offerings of each family are deposited in an excavation in the family field, generally the cornfield, despite the fact that these are at greater distances from the village. After the offerings are made everyone is supposed to abstain from animal food, in addition to the usual requirement of sexual continence. Abstinence from meat is required because of the offering to the sun, which employs only downy feathers, which are especially potent and carry with thorn the pledge of abstinence. Among the younger people only those who belong to societies fast from meat. The others would consider it wrong to do so. "While we were away at school we ate meat, and it is a bad thing to break one's custom."</p>
 <p>On the fourth day each initiated male offers to the katcinas, and each male society member offers to the beast gods. These offerings are made in the cornfield or in the fields to the east of the village. That night, after dark, special offerings are made in the corrals for the increase of horses, cattle, and sheep, for clothing and ornaments, and for medicine. Each man uses a different kind of stick and guards this secret knowledge jealously.</p>
 <p>There are prayers to be said at each stage of the process of prayer stick making. Prayers are always offered to the trees before cutting the sticks. Corn meal is offered to the "lucky" tree. This is not cut, but another is taken. The rest of the prayers are generally</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[8. That is, human, the inhabitants of Zuñi.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 624}</p>
 <p>omitted until the stick is finished. Then the following brief prayer is spoken over it before it is set aside until the time comes to plant it:</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>
 Since our moon mother<br>
 Yonder in the west[9]<br>
 Appeared, still small;<br>
 When but a short space yet remained<br>
 Till she was fully grown,<br>
 Then out daylight father,[10]<br>

 When you have arrayed yourselves in these,<br>

 25 Your seeds<br>
 You will bless all my children.<br>
 All your good fortune<br>
 You will grant to them all.<br>
 To this end, my father,<br>

 May I finish my road;<br>
 May I grow old;<br>
 May you bless me with life.</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">A MONTHLY OFFERING OF PRAYER STICKS</h2>
 <p>At each full moon (in some societies at the new moon) each member of a society offers prayer sticks. In addition to special offerings prescribed by the society there are two to four short black sticks for the ancestors and, for males, one similar black stick, with the addition of a duck feather, for the katcinas. The sticks are buried in the corn field or at Red Earth, a point on the river bank east of the town. The prayer sticks are deposited with the following prayer, which was secured from one of the headmen of the Wood Society.</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYERS TO DEAD WIFE, WITH OFFERINGS OF PRAYER MEAL AND PRAYER STICKS</h2>
 <p>When a man's wife dies for four days he observes the most stringent taboos. He remains continent; he abstains from eating meat, grease, and salt. He sits alone, away from the fire, and must not be touched. He should not speak or be spoken to. Each morning at dawn he drinks an emetic and goes out on the eastern road to offer black corn meal to the dead spouse. He holds the black meal in the left hand, passes it four times over his head, and throws it away as rite of exorcism. Then, using the right hand, he scatters white meal, and prays. These taboos are the same as those offered by a warrior who has taken a scalp, and are directed to the same ends, the removal of contamination and the propitiation of the ghost. The ghost, who is lonely, will try to visit her husband in dreams. To prevent this he uses black corn meal, "to make the road dark" or "to forget."</p>
 <p>After the four days he plants prayer sticks and resumes normal life. For 12 months he should remain continent, lest the dead wife become jealous. During this period he is "dangerous." At the end of this period he has intercourse with a stranger to whom he gives a gift, the instrument for removing the contamination. She throws this away. Next day both plant prayer sticks. If he desires to shorten the period, he gets some man with esoteric knowledge to make him especially potent prayer sticks two or four sets-planted at intervals of four days, which are offered to the dead wife with the following prayer. These same rites are observed also by a widow and a warrior who has taken a scalp.</p>
 <p>This is the only example which has come to my knowledge of any offering made to an individual, and even in this the ancestors are included. This prayer is also used with offerings of prayer sticks to the dead, on the fourth day after death, the day in which the spirit is believed to reach the land of the dead.[21]</p>

 <p>On the eighth day of life an infant's head is washed by his "aunts"--that is, women of his father's clan, his most important ceremonial relatives. Corn meal is placed in his hand and he is taken outdoors, facing the east, at the moment of sunrise. Corn meal is sprinkled to the rising sun with the following prayer, spoken by the paternal grandmother:</p>
 <p>Now this is the day.<br>
 Our child,<br>
 Into the daylight<br>
 You will go out standing.<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">THE P?EKWIN SETS THE DATE FOR THE SUMMER SOLSTICE</h2>
 <p>Before the summer solstice the p?ekwin makes daily observations of the sunset from a shrine east of the village. When the sun sets behind a certain point in the mesa he begins to count days with offerings of prayer sticks. There are six such offerings according to Mrs. Stevenson.[1] At dawn of the morning following the last offering he announces from the highest housetop in Zuñi that the summer solstice will take place after eight days.</p>
 <p>Now that those who hold our roads,<br>
 Dawn ancients,<br>
 Youths,<br>
 Matrons,<br>
 5 Maidens,<br>
 Over their sacred place,<br>
 Have raised their curtain.<br>
 Here, on the corn priests' housetop<br>

 20 You shall pass the days.<br>
 I think it is this many days, eight days,<br>
 And then on the ninth day.<br>
 You will grant that all of us finish our roads.</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYER OF THE FIRE KEEPER AT THE WINTER SOLSTICE</h2>
 <p>The keeper of the New Year fire is appointed by the priests on the ninth day following the p?ekwin's announcement of the solstice. This is the day on which all people cut prayer sticks. During the day he collects wood from houses in the village and in the evening builds the New Year fire in he'?iwa kiva. On this evening the images of the gods of war are taken to the kiva for their all-night ceremony. The fire keeper must be a man of the Badger clan or a child of that clan. He is called tsu'pal-i'lona (the one who has the blood pudding; the fire is his tsu'palon:e, or blood pudding). During the ensuing ten days he must observe continence and eat no meat or other animal food. He sleeps and eats at his own house, but returns to the kiva to tend the fire, which must be kept burning throughout the period. He visits every house in the village to get wood for his fire.</p>
 <p>At sundown on the ninth day of the second period[2] he comes to the kiva. Here p?ekwin has made a meal painting and set up an altar. When all the priests have arrived p?ekwin goes to summon the impersonators of P?a'utiwa and the four Sa'yalhia. They come unmasked, their masks having been taken to the kiva earlier in the day.</p>
 <p>At sunset Ci'tsuk^a and Kwe'lele, gods from the east, enter the village from the east. They dance for a few minutes on the roof of the kiva and then go in. After brief prayers they go to the house of the Great Fire Society to eat. The masks belong to this society, and the impersonators must be chosen from the Great God order of the society.</p>
 <p>Late at night they are again summoned to the kiva. Here are the priests, the impersonators of P?a'utiwa and the Sa'yalhia, men of the Dogwood and Sun clans who dress P?a'utiwa, and singers from He'iwa kiva. With Ci'tsuk^a and Kwe'lele go the headmen of the Great Fire Society and a group of singers from that society. The two choirs sing alternately and Kwe'lele and Ci'tsuk^a dance. The fire keeper sits all night beside the fireplace, within a circle of meal across which he must not step.</p>
 <p>[2. See p. 535.]</p>
 <p>{p. 638}</p>
 <p>At the first sign of dawn P?a'utiwa dresses. When he is ready the chief of the Great Fire Society kindles fire with the ancient drill which Kwe'lele carries. As soon as the fire appears Kwe'lele lights his torch. The fire keeper takes a brand from his fire and, accompanied by Kwe'lele with his torch, p?ekwin, Ko'mosona, P?a'utiwa, and the four Sa'yalhia, goes out to the east. At a point well beyond the last house they pause. The fire keeper lays down his brand, and Kwe'lele extinguishes his torch. All pray and sprinkle meal. Then the party returns to the kiva.</p>
 <p>This is the sign to the village that the fire taboo is ended, and immediately everyone hastens to take out their fire and sweepings. When they return to the kiva the fire keeper and p?ekwin pray. Then the people go to their houses to take out the fire from their hearths. They return immediately, and the masked gods dance until daylight. At this time anyone may enter the kiva to receive the blessings of the gods.</p>
 <p>The following prayer is spoken by the fire keeper when he returns from the east in the morning. It was dictated by a member of the Great Fire Society.</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>
 Since the sun, who is our father,<br>
 Stood yonder beside his left hand sacred place.[3]<br>
 5 Then our fathers<br>
 Having prepared plume wands for the rite of their ancestors,<br>
 And having breathed their prayers upon the plume wands,<br>

 Eagerly we have awaited your day.<br>
 Now that all their days are at an end,<br>
 145 Eagerly waiting until another day shall come,<br>
 We shall pass our days.<br>
 Indeed it is so.<br>
 Far off someone will be my father,<br>
 The divine one,<br>
 150 He of the Badger clan.<br>
 Asking for his life-giving breath<br>
 His breath of old age,<br>
 His breath of waters,<br>
 His breath of seeds,<br>
 155 His breath of fecundity,<br>
 His breath of all good fortune,<br>
 Asking for his breath.<br>
 And into my warm body<br>
 Drawing his breath,<br>
 160 I shall add to your breath.<br>
 Do not despise the breath of your fathers,<br>
 But into your bodies<br>
 Draw his breath,</p>
 <p>{p. 642}</p>
 <p>165 That yonder to where the life-giving road of your sun father comes out<br>
 Your roads may reach;<br>
 That you may finish your roads;<br>
 For this I add to your breath.<br>
 170 To this end, my fathers,<br>
 My children,<br>
 May all of you be blessed with light.</p>

 <h1 align="CENTER">III. PRAYERS TO THE UWANAMMI</h1>
 <p>Four days after the summer solstice the priesthoods begin their series of retreats to pray for rain. Each set in turn goes in at the house where their sacred bundle is kept. The four chief priesthoods associated with the four cardinal points go in for eight days each. They are followed by the p?ekwin, who goes in for four days. He is followed by the bow priest, who observes a 4-day retreat, although he does not stay in his house. After these the minor priesthoods, "the darkness people," follow in fixed order. They go in for four days each. The last come out about the first week in September, which is near the end of the rainy season.</p>
 <p>Retreats always start in the evening, generally after sunset, and nights only are counted. They end at sunrise on the fourth or eighth morning following. The day before the retreat begins is spent by the priests in making prayer sticks. These are tied together in the after noon, and shortly before sunset the chief priest accompanied by an associate leaves to plant them in a distant spring. They return late at night. They go immediately into the inner room set aside for their retreat, where the other members have already assembled.. The chief priest sets up his altar--a meal painting, one or more feather-wrapped com fetishes, pots of black paint that have been brought from the underworld, stone knives, thunder stones, and finally the sacred bundle itself.</p>
 <p>The first of the two prayers below is said with the offering of corn meal when gathering willow sticks, the second on setting the sacred bundle on the altar. They were dictated by a former member of the priesthood of the water serpent, and have been verified by a priest of the priesthood of the south.</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYER OF A PRIEST ON GOING INTO RETREAT</h2>

 All you who in divine wisdom,<br>
 Stand here quietly,<br>
 Carrying your waters<br>
 You will go before<br>
 Thus to Itiwana<br>
 Our roads will go.<br>
 The water filled rooms of your daylight children<br>
 Your road will enter.<br>
 Sitting down quietly,<br>
 After a blessed night<br>
 With us, your children,<br>
 You will come to day.<br>
 To-morrow<br>
 When he who holds our roads,<br>
 Our sun father,<br>
 Coming out to stand at his sacred place<br>
 Passes our roads,<br>
 Then we shall pass one another on our roads.<br>
 The divine ones<br>
 From wherever they abide permanently<br>
 Will make their roads come forth.<br>
 They will come.<br>
 And where they sit down quietly<br>
 All of us shall pass one another on our roads.<br>
 For our fathers,<br>
 Our mothers,<br>
 Those who first had being,<br>
 And also for our fathers,<br>
 Rain maker priests,<br>
 Rain maker p?ekwins,<br>
 Rain maker bow priests<br>
 For their rite<br>
 We shall give our plume wands human form.<br>
 We have given our plume wands human form,<br>
 With the massed cloud wing<br>
 Of the one who is our grandfather,<br>
 The male turkey,<br>
 With eagle's thin cloud wings,<br>
 And with the striped cloud wings<br>
 And massed cloud tails<br>
 Of all the birds of summer;<br>
 And with the flesh of the one who is our mother<br>
 Cotton woman,<br>
 Even a rough cotton thread,<br>
 A soiled cotton thread<br>
 With this four times encircling our plume wands<br>
 And tying it about their bodies,<br>
 We have given our plume wands human form.<br>
 Then also with the flesh of our mother,<br>
 Black paint woman,<br>
 Covering them with flesh,<br>
 We have prepared our plume wands.<br>
 When our plume wands were ready,<br>
 Saying, "Let it be now."<br>
 Taking our plume wands,<br>
 Our plume wands which had been finished,<br>
 Rising, we came out of our house.<br>
 With prayers we made our roads come forth.<br>
 At the place called since the first beginning<br>
 Rock wedge,[2]<br>
 Where our fathers,<br>
 Rain maker priests,<br>
 In their rain-filled inner rooms[3]<br>
 Were all gathered together in beauty<br>
 To receive their plume wands,<br>
 There we passed them, on their roads.<br>
 Passing them on their roads<br>
 There we gave our fathers plume wands,<br>
 Our fathers,<br>
 By means of their divine wisdom<br>
 Laid hold of their plume wands.<br>
 On all sides<br>
 They will talk together, touching one another with the plume wands,[4]<br>
 Yonder at the north encircling ocean<br>
 You will hold discourse together touching each other with them.<br>

 Grasping your plume wands,<br>
 You will see your plume wands.<br>
 You will see whether they have been finished with precious paint,[6]<br>
 Or else are unfinished.<br>
 With your spittle,<br>
 With your flesh,<br>
 With your divine wisdom,<br>
 They will be made over afresh into human beings;<br>
 They will be strong.<br>
 From wherever you abide permanently<br>
 You will make your roads come forth.<br>
 Your little wind blown clouds,<br>
 Your thin wisps of clouds,<br>
 Your great masses of clouds<br>
 Replete with living waters,<br>

 Our mothers,<br>
 Our children,<br>
 All the different kinds of corn,<br>
 Nourishing themselves with their father's waters<br>
 Tenderly will bring forth their young.<br>
 Clasping their children[7]<br>
 All will finish their roads.<br>
 Then our children,<br>
 Our ladder-descending children,<br>
 Will gather you in.<br>
 Into all their houses.<br>
 You will make your roads enter.<br>
 To stay there quietly.<br>
 Then also tenderly<br>
 Their young will multiply<br>
 Multiplying our young,<br>
 Those toward whom our thoughts are bent,<br>
 You will live.<br>
 You will not think to hurry to some other place.[8]<br>
 Indeed, this shall not be.<br>
 But always in their houses<br>
 You will remain at rest.<br>
 In order that our children's thoughts may be bent to this,<br>
 For this you are our father,<br>
 You are our mother;<br>
 For this you who first had being,<br>
 Perpetuating your rite of the first beginning<br>
 Sit here quietly.<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">THE P?EKWIN GOES INTO RETREAT</h2>
 <p>The retreat of the p?ekwin follows next after the priests of the four directions. He is priest of the sun, and is associated, according to Mrs. Stevenson, with the zenith. This association, however, does not seem firmly fixed.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[15 The sacred bundle.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 659}</p>
 <p>The p?ekwin has no eton:e or priestly bundle. He has pots of black paint brought from the underworld and undoubtedly other ceremonial paraphernalia. But his altar lacks the water and seed-filled reeds which constitute the most sacred and potent possessions of the other priests. He is thought to be so pure in heart that he has no need of magic to make his prayers effective. Therefore, before going into retreat he plants his prayer sticks not at a spring, but in his corn field. He does not bring back a jug of the sacred water of some spring to place on his altar. For the first part of his retreat "he tries himself." He sits down before an altar consisting only of his paint pots on a painting of meal. It lacks even the bowl of medicine water. As soon as the first rain falls he may mix his medicine in the fresh rain water. If no rain falls, he must continue until the end without even this frail aid to prayer. He is tested at each retreat, and it is always a point of special note whether or not his days are blessed with rain.</p>
 <p>The following prayer is recited at the beginning of his retreat. The first part is spoken outside when he plants his prayer sticks, the latter half after he returns to his home.[16]</p>
 <p>This many are the days,<br>
 Since the new year,<br>
 The cycle of the months of our fathers,<br>
 The ones that first had being.<br>
 This many days<br>
 We have awaited our time.<br>
 It has come to summer.<br>
 My fathers,<br>
 My mothers,<br>
 10 The ones that first had being,<br>
 Your day goes on.<br>
 Not long ago,<br>
 At the middle of the year[17]<br>
 I made my fathers' days.[18]<br>
 15 This many were the days of the rain makers of all directions,<br>
 And now that my fathers' days are at an end,<br>
 20 Yonder, wherever the roads of the rain makers come forth,[19]<br>
 Where people pray to finish their roads,<br>
 There you stand at the borders of our land,<br>

 30 This day, my fathers,<br>
 You who here were p?ekwins,<br>
 You who used to take care of the world,<br>
 You who used to be chiefs of the downy feather,[21]<br>
 35 And furthermore, my sun father,<br>
 My child,<br>
 This day,<br>
 When you came out standing to your sacred place,<br>
 40 This day<br>
 In my house<br>
 For your rite<br>
 I fashioned plume wands in human form.<br>
 With the striped cloud wing of my father,<br>
 45 Male turkey,<br>
 With the striped cloud wing of oriole, p?ekwin priest,[22]<br>
 Arid blue jay, p?ekwin priest,<br>
 And the wings of all the different birds of summer,<br>
 With these four times<br>
 I gave my plume wands human form.<br>
 With the flesh of my mother,<br>
 My grandmother,<br>
 55 Yucca fiber,<br>

 Even a soiled cotton thread,<br>
 With these I gave my plume wands human form.<br>
 With the flesh of the one who is my mother,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[20. The willow sticks.</p>
 <p>21. Prayer sticks offered to the sun, the moon, and the rain makers are made with downy feathers of the eagle. After planting these sticks the suppliant must refrain from animal food for four days. The downy feather is considered the p?ekwin's because he always plants to the sun. The other priests use it when rain is urgently needed and thereafter must abstain from animal food. Prayer sticks to the ancestors, deceased members of societies or priesthoods, and the katcinas are made with turkey feathers. It is as guardian of the calendar that the p?ekwin "takes care of the world,"</p>
 <p>22. The bird associated with the north. The birds of the six directions are the p?ekwins or heralds of the directions. The p?ekwin, who is the herald of the sun, is frequently referred to as, "all the birds of summer, p?ekwins."

 Now that this is at an end<br>
 Your days are made.<br>
 After a little while<br>

 115 Send forth your massed clouds to stay with us,<br>

 With their hands a little burnt,<br>
 With their heads brown,<br>
 They stand poor at the borders of our land.<br>
 That these may be nourished with fresh water,<br>

 When the time of my days is at an end,<br>
 Though I say "my days are at an end,"<br>
 No--it is not so.<br>

 We shall pass the days.<br>

 Now I have fulfilled your thoughts.<br>
 This is all.</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">THE BOW PRIEST IN RETREAT IN SUMMER</h2>
 <p>On the day the p?ekwin comes out of retreat in summer the bow priest begins to count days. He is not a rain priest. He has no altar; he has no rain-making fetish; his sacred possessions are associated rather with war. Therefore, instead of remaining in meditation and prayer in his ceremonial house, he makes offerings at the various shrines of the gods of war on mountain tops around Zuñi. The first day he goes to the north, to Twin Mountains; the second day to the west--the place actually visited is a shrine to the south on a knoll near the road to the Salt Lake. The third day he goes to the south, Face Mountain, a shrine southeast of Zuñi; the fourth day to the east, a knoll near the Black Rock road. At each of these shrines he offers corn meal and turquoise with prayers for rain and fertility. He offers these in his capacity of priest rather than as warrior.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[26. The p?ekwin is severely criticized should it fail to rain during the days of his retreat. Criticism does not fall so heavily on other priests should they fail.]</p>

(Tsik^?ähiya means "quick moving hair.") A dirigible which flew over Zuñi some years ago was identified with K^?älhawani, who books "like an icicle " when he appears to mortals. K^?älhawani is sometimes impersonated in mask with a tablet headdress and long flowing hair reaching to his knees. The third supernatural usually mentioned with Tsik^?ähiya and K^?älhawani is Kupictaiya (cf. Keres Kopictaiya), called by Mrs. Stevenson lightning makers. There is some confusion in the minds of the Zuñi as to whether these are individuals or classes of supernaturals. The latter is more in keeping with Zuñi ideology.]</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYERS BEFORE GOING ON A WAR PARTY</h2>
 <p>Before going on the warpath the bow priests are summoned to their ceremonial house. The chief bow priest addresses them:</p>

 Our thoughts have been troubled;<br>
 5 Our appetite has failed.<br>
 This very day<br>

 We shall take the warpath.<br>
 Because of the enemy,<br>
 Because of their thoughts,<br>
 15 We wish in vain see one another,[5]<br>
 We can not see him of whom we think.<br>
 Because it is thus,<br>
 To be avenged<br>
 We have made up our minds.<br>
 20 My children,<br>
 You shall set your minds to be men.<br>
 You shall think to provide yourselves with good weapons.<br>
 Then, perhaps, we shall have the good fortune,<br>
 To get that which we wish,<br>
 25 That for which we ask--<br>
 Namely that with the enemies' flocks,<br>
 Their clothing,<br>
 Their precious stones,<br>
 Their good shell beads,<br>
 30 That with these our houses may obtain hearts,<br>
 For this we have sent forth our prayers.<br>
 Waiting anxiously until the appointed time shall come,<br>

 May you come to day.<br>
 And to-morrow<br>
 50 After a good day may you come to evening.<br>
 And as each day comes,<br>
 Eagerly may you wait their day.<br>
 55 May your thought not be vacillating.<br>

 95 And into my warm body drawing their breath,<br>
 I shall add to your breath.<br>
 To this end, my children:<br>
 May You be blessed with life.</p>
 <p>The date for starting is set. Any man who wishes to join the party tells the bow priests, and the destination is determined according to the size of the party. During the interval offerings are made by the bow priests at the various shrines referred to in the preceding prayer. The night before they leave all volunteers meet at the ceremonial house of the bow priests. Each man deposits prayer meal, corn pollen, and some precious material--shell, turquoise, red paint, or iridescent black paint--in each of four corn husks. These are immediately taken to four distant shrines, by the elder and younger brother bow priests, the war chief, and the society chief of the bow priesthood. On reaching the shrine the emissary says:</p>
 <p>How are you this evening?<br>
 (He answers himself, speaking in the person of the god:)<br>
 Happy. Have you come? Sit down.<br>
 Now, indeed, you have passed us on our roads.<br>

 Nevertheless, in spite of your speaking thus,<br>
 35 We can not part with you.<br>
 We have your plume wands,<br>
 We have your shells,<br>

 I have passed you on your road.<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYERS OF THE SCALP DANCE</h2>
 <p>Whenever an enemy is killed the slayer, if not already a member of the bow priesthood or one of the other two warrior societies, the Hunters (Saniak^?äkwe) or the Cactus Society (K?ocikwe), must immediately join the bow priesthood to protect himself from the malevolence of the slain enemy. The initiation takes place in the course of the scalp dance which is held to celebrate the victory. The purpose of the scalp dance is twofold. First, to purify the scalper from the contaminating contact with the dead and make him safe for human association and by placing him under the protection of the war gods, through membership in their cult, the bow priest hood, save him from pursuit by the ghost; the second purpose is to propitiate the dead enemy, strip him of his power for evil, and turn to good account his potentialities as a rain maker. This propitiation of the scalp is primarily the office of the scalp chief, who also retains guardianship of the scalps reposing in the scalp house.</p>
 <p>Accompanying these important secret rites of purification and propitiation are the great public festivities. Throughout the twelve days of the ceremony unrestrained merrymaking accompanied by sexual license is indulged in by young and old of both sexes. These three strands run side by side, all culminating in the great ceremonies of the final day.</p>
 <p>The order of events in this long and elaborate ritual has been described in the accounts by Mrs. Stevenson[10] and Doctor Parsons[11] with varying emphasis on the different aspects, according to the affiliation of the informants.</p>
 <p>For convenience in reading the following prayers the events may be briefly summarized.</p>
 <p>The returning war party camps overnight outside the village. At dawn four men chosen to announce their return ride toward the village uttering their war cry. They are met by the scalp chief, who inquires concerning the exploits of the war party.</p>
 <p>During the day the scalp chief secretes the scalp at a distance from the village in a diminutive shelter of brush. The scalper and his "elder brother," the member of the bow priesthood who has "caught " the novice, take turns in watching over it. Toward evening they go through a sham conflict and take the scalp, bringing it to a place on the plain where p?ekwin has prepared an altar. Here they are met</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[10. Twenty-third Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 578.</p>
 <p>11. Scalp Ceremonial at Zuñi.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 675}</p>
 <p>by men and women appointed to take part in the coming ceremonies, the priests, the scalp chief, the bow priesthood, the Ant Society, the guardians of war bundles, and the male populace. There is ceremonial smoking by all present. Prayer sticks are planted by the scalper in a near-by ant hill, and many songs are sung and prayers offered. Finally the scalp is placed on the foot of the aunt of the scalper, who kicks it four times. Encircling the village four times, in counterclockwise circuit, the party goes in. The scalp is set upon a tall pole in the plaza amid general rejoicings, and the period of festivity is announced first by p?ekwin and then by the bow priest.</p>
 <p>The scalper goes into retreat in the ceremonial house of the bow priests. For four days he eats no meat or grease or any hot food. He sits away from the fire, sleeps little, does not speak, and is untouchable. He drinks emetics and goes out each morning to pray for deliverance from the scalp. He must also observe the sexual taboos placed upon the widowed.[12] The woman who brought in the scalp must also observe all these taboos. The days are spent in preparation for the final ceremonies.</p>
 <p>On the fifth day the scalp is washed by two men appointed for this purpose. Thus is the enemy received into the company of the rain makers who Eve in the scalp house. Meanwhile the public festivities have begun. There are public dances each day, two selected groups performing on alternate days, while at night young and old of both sexes dance about the scalp pole.</p>
 <p>About the sixth day a man of the Deer clan and a man of the Bear clan start work on the images of the gods of war. On the twelfth night these and all their paraphernalia are taken into the house of the bow priests. Here, in an all-night ceremony, the novice is finally taken into their company to share their supernatural prerogatives, including the special protection of the gods of war.</p>
 <p>The following day is the "great dance." The images of the gods of war, the various war bundles, and the chief priestly bundles are set up on an altar in the plaza, behind which sit all the high officials of the Zuñi hierarchy. Throughout the day various dancers take turns in dancing before this altar. Toward evening the bow priests sing the songs given them at the institution of their society by the gods of war.</p>
 <p>After this the altar is demolished and the meal painting obliterated. The sacred bundles are returned to the houses where they are kept. The images of the gods of war are taken to their houses by members of the bow priesthood, and next day carried to appropriate shrines (not the ones that are visited during the winter solstice). Late at night the scalp is removed from the pole by the scalp chief and deposited by him in the scalp house, with special prayers for protection in his dangerous office.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[12. See p. 632.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 676}</p>
 <p>The following prayers represent but the least fragment of this complex ritual. They deal almost entirely with the office of scalp chief; that is, the propitiation of the scalp. They were dictated by an old man, a son of a former scalp chief, now deceased.</p>
 <p>At dawn the scalp chief meets four men who announce the return of the war party:[13]</p>
 <p>Now, neglecting your children,<br>

 (And one of the enemy)<br>
 Fought together. . . .</p>
 <p>(The account breaks off here. The informant lacked imagination to continue the narrative of the exploits of the war party.)</p>
 <p>In the evening the scalp is brought into the village.[14] At the close of the ceremonies on the plain the scalp chief deposits in an excavation between two mounds of bread which he collected earlier in the day at the houses of the priests. The offering is specifically to the slain Navaho.</p>

 Eagerly you shall await his day.<br>
 55 Whenever his days are made,<br>
 Throughout the days,<br>
 Throughout the nights,<br>
 Tirelessly, unwearied,<br>
 60 You shall live.<br>
 Indeed, even though you ache from singing,<br>
 Even though you fain would sleep,<br>
 In order to win the enemy's waters,<br>
 65 His seeds,<br>
 His wealth,<br>
 His power,<br>
 His strong spirit,<br>
 To win these.<br>
 70 Throughout the nights<br>
 Throughout the days,<br>
 Tirelessly, unwearied<br>
 You shall live.<br>
 Then indeed, if we are lucky,<br>
 To some little corner<br>
 Where the dust lies thick,<br>
 (You will steal away.)<br>
 In order to procreate sturdy[22] men<br>
 And sturdy women,<br>
 Tirelessly you will live.<br>
 To procreate strong males,<br>
 To procreate sturdy females,<br>
 85 To be the ones toward your thoughts may bend,<br>

 You will keep the days.<br>

 By virtue of the corn priests' rain prayers<br>
 (He becomes valuable;)<br>
 Indeed, the enemy,<br>
 Though in his life<br>
 95 He was a person given to falsehood,<br>
 He has become one to fortell<br>
 How the world will be,<br>
 How the days will be.<br>
 That during his time,<br>
 100 We may have good days,<br>
 Beautiful days,<br>
 Hoping for this,<br>
 We shall keep his days.<br>

 During the enemy's time<br>

 Heavy rain caressing the earth,<br>
 (We shall win.)<br>
 110 When the enemy's days are in progress,<br>
 The enemy's waters,<br>
 We shall win,<br>

 <p>The elder brother bow priest addresses the people in the same vein. Then the scalp chief offers to the scalp a handful of bread saved from his earlier offering.</p>
 <p>Now, this day<br>
 That you have been set up<br>
 In the corn priests' rain-filled court,<br>
 All the children of the corn priest<br>
 5 Will be dancing for you.<br>
 All the children of the corn priest<br>
 Will pass you on your road.<br>
 They will add to your heart.<br>
 10 Should anyone by mistake touch you<br>
 May no evil consequence befall him because of it.<br>
 With this fruit of the corn priests' labor<br>
 Add to your heart.<br>
 Your long life,<br>
 15 Your old age,<br>
 Your waters,<br>
 Your seeds.<br>
 Grant them.<br>
 To cleanse the thoughts<br>
 20 Of whoever has angry thoughts,<br>
 For this you will stand up here.</p>
 <p>After four days the scalp is washed at any spring outside the town or in the river. Care is taken that the water used for the washing does not flow back into the river to bring death to those who drink of it. The scalp washer bites the scalp to get the power of the beast gods. "He acts like an animal," and therefore he does not need, in order to save his life, to observe the taboos generally required by contaminating contact with the dead. Prayer sticks are planted before the ceremony. At the conclusion the bowl is broken and cast away</p>
 <p>{p. 682}</p>
 <p>and offerings of food are thrown about on the ground. During the ceremony of washing, the choir sings new songs made for the occasion and the scalp washer prays:</p>
 <p>Now this day<br>
 Our sun father,<br>
 Having come out standing<br>
 To his sacred place,<br>
 A little space yet remains<br>
 Ere he goes in to sit down at his other sacred place.<br>
 Now four times raising our niece,[21]<br>
 10 And making her stand up,<br>
 Her road going first,<br>
 Hither with prayers,<br>
 We have made our road come forth.<br>
 Here, near by, our fathers,<br>
 15 Rain maker bow priests,<br>
 Where your watery road comes forth,<br>
 Where you are waiting,<br>
 We have passed you on your road.<br>
 We have offered you plume wands.<br>
 20 Taking your plume wands,<br>
 With them you will take firm hold<br>
 Of the enemy's water-filled covering.<br>
 With your fresh water<br>
 25 You will sprinkle him.<br>
 Then again, if your hands go first,<br>

 We shall meet no evil consequence.[25]<br>

 <p>40 When into the corn priests' country<br>
 He has brought his road,<br>
 When in the corn priests' water-filled court<br>
 He has been set up,<br>
 All the corn priests' children<br>
 45 With the song sequences of the fathers,<br>
 Will be dancing for him.<br>
 And whenever all his days are past,<br>
 Then a good day,<br>
 50 A beautiful day,<br>
 A day filled with great shouting,<br>
 With great laughter,<br>
 A good day,<br>
 With us, your children,<br>
 55 You will pass.<br>
 Thus the corn priests, children<br>
 Winning your power,<br>
 Winning your strong spirit,<br>
 Will come to evening.<br>
 To this end, my fathers,<br>
 60 Now let us take hold of our niece.</p>
 <p>After the dancing of the last day the scalp chief takes down the scalp. He and his associates remain in hiding on the outskirts of the village until midnight. Then they proceed singing to the scalp house. Each has under his tongue several grains of black corn to prevent pursuit by the ghost.[26] The scalp chief places the scalp in the jar in the scalp house and prays:</p>
 <p>Now this many are the days<br>
 Since the enemy<br>
 Reached the end of his life.<br>
 Our fathers,<br>
 5 Those who hold the high places,<br>
 Beast bow priests,<br>

 His water-filled covering.<br>
 Into the corn priests' country,<br>
 They made his road enter.<br>
 10 And in the corn priests' water-filled court<br>
 Standing him up,<br>
 They made his days.<br>
 This many are the days.<br>

 had all been counted up,</p>

 Rain maker priests,<br>
 With their clear water<br>

 20 Again in the corn priests' court<br>
 Setting him up, they made his days.<br>
 This many days<br>
 The corn priests' children<br>
 25 With their fathers' song sequences<br>

 Those who are our fathers,<br>

 With their elder brothers' plume wands,<br>

 Holding their people fast,<br>
 Sitting down quietly,<br>
 With us their children<br>
 After a blessed night[30]<br>
 They came to day.<br>
 40 This very day<br>
 When he who is our sun father,<br>
 Coming out standing to his sacred place<br>
 Passed us on our roads,<br>
 45 Saying, let it be now,<br>
 Those who are our fathers,<br>

 Then our two fathers,<br>
 Those who hold the high places,<br>
 With their house chiefs,[31]<br>
 70 Their p?ekwins,<br>
 Holding all their sacred things<br>

 So that your people you may waft hither only,<br>
 So that you may speed them hither,<br>
 On this do not fail to fix your thoughts.[38]<br>
 This is all.</p>
 <p>He deposits the scalp in the scalp house, replaces the cover and comes back to the village. On his way back he mounts to four housetops, leaving on each a grain of black corn "to make his road dark." At his own house the ladder has been turned upside down. As soon as he has mounted it, it is righted so that the ghost can not follow him up. He comes into the house without speaking, hangs up his blanket and goes right out. Standing on the housetop facing the east, holding in his hands what yet remains of the black corn, he prays:</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>

 <p>Taking out the black corn, he passes it around four times in front of him. Reentering the house, he repeats the prayer, still holding the corn in his hand. At the end, he again passes it around counter clockwise before him, as a rite of exorcism, and sets it aside to be planted in spring. Then his aunts wash his head and bathe him. The following day he deposits prayer sticks at amitolan t?ep?o?ulikwi (where the rainbow bends over), a shrine to the gods of war, located in the canyon southwest of Zuñi. The prayer is similar.</p>
 <h1 align="CENTER">V. PRAYERS AND CHANTS OF THE PRIESTS OF THE<br>
 MASKED GODS. I</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">THE COMING OF K^ÄKLO</h2>
 <p>In former times the preliminary initiation of small children took place every fourth year. In these years the chief of the cult group in charge of the K^äklo ritual received from the priests at the winter solstice a prayer stick commanding his participation.</p>
 <p>The ceremony is held in March or April. Eight days before the actual whipping of the children K^äklo appears to announce the approaching ceremony and command those concerned to prepare for it. In each kiva he intones a long chant describing in great detail the mythological sanction of the, coming ceremony.[1] After visiting all the kivas he departs.</p>
 <p>After eight days he comes again. Again he visits each kiva, repeating his chant. At dawn he is ready to depart. As he leaves, the gods who perform the initiation ceremonies appear and enter the village.</p>
 <p>The following prayer is spoken by the impersonator of K^äklo at some time during his preparations for his ceremony, probably at the moment of taking out the mask before his second appearance.</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>
 Since the moon who is our mother<br>
 Yonder in the west a small thing<br>
 First became visible.<br>
 When she reached maturity<br>
 5 Then the one who is my father,<br>
 K^äklo, p?ekwin priest,<br>
 perpetuating his rite had since the first beginning--<br>
 Yonder from his perfect mountain<br>
 Made his road come forth.<br>
 10 He made his road come hither.<br>
 Into Itiwana his road entered,<br>
 There, wherever the roads of his children come forth<br>
 He made his road enter.<br>
 His words came forth.</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYER OF THE IMPERSONATOR OF P?A'UTIWA</h2>
 <p>P?autiwa is the katcina chief at Katcina village. It is he who determines the order of masked rituals and dances, and sends forth masked beings to dance for his daylight children at Zuñi. The great masked ceremonies are held expressly by his order. They can only be held when he commands them at the new year. In folklore he appears frequently in the rôle of the divine lover of mortal maidens.</p>
 <p>He appears three times annually at Zuñi--twice during the winter solstice, and at the mola:wia which closes the great masked festival of the late fall. He comes, therefore, at the beginning and end of the year. He is one of the most beautiful of all Zuñi impersonations. The mask is turquoise blue, elaborately adorned with the most precious feathers, in particular the priceless tail feathers of the macaw. He is fully clothed in rich clothing, including four embroidered white cotton blankets and innumerable, strings of the finest turquoise. His gait is slow and stately. He always goes sprinkling corn meal before him. It is altogether an impersonation of the greatest splendor and solemnity.[2]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[2. See pl. I and Twenty-third Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pl. xxviii.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 693}</p>
 <p>The winter solstice ceremonies and P?autiwa's part in them are described on pp. 535 and 908.</p>
 <p>After P?autiwa has visited all the kivas he goes out toward the West. After undressing, at a point on the river, he is met by men of the Sun clan who escort him to the house of the house chief. Here are assembled all priests of the council, and members of the Dogwood clan. On entering, the impersonator of Pautiwa offers a long prayer recounting the duties of his office and invoking a blessing on the people. The house chief replies, thanking him, and then asks him what be has seen in his rounds of the village. He then relates what omens have been observed in the four excavations. The following prayer recited when he enters the ceremonial room, was dictated by a member of the Dogwood clan:</p>
 <p>Now this many are the days<br>
 Since there yet remained a little space<br>
 Ere our sun father<br>
 Stood close beside his left hand sacred place,<br>

 15 When we had lived through the full number of his days,<br>
 And when all the days were past,<br>
 He thought of those said to be the bearers of messages<br>
 To all the different directions,<br>
 The forest beings,<br>
 20 The brush beings.<br>
 When for their sun father,<br>
 Their moon mother,<br>
 Our daylight children<br>
 Had counted up the days<br>
 And when we come to the middle division of the days,[3]<br>

 40 Offering prayer meal,<br>
 Shell,<br>
 Corn pollen,<br>
 Among their slender finger tips<br>

 Breaking off the young green shoots of some lucky one,<br>
 And drawing them toward him[4]<br>
 Even from where they abide quietly,<br>
 50 Holding their long life,<br>
 Holding their old age,<br>
 He brought them hither.<br>
 Now this many days<br>
 In our houses,<br>
 55 With us, their children,<br>
 They have stayed.<br>

 <h1 align="CENTER">VI. PRAYERS AND CHANTS OF THE PRIESTS OF THE<br>
 MASKED GODS. II</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYERS AND CHANTS OF THE CA?LAKO CEREMONIES</h2>
 <p>During the taboo period of the winter solstice[1] ceremony the priests select men who are to impersonate the priests of the masked gods during the coming year. They are notified of their appointment, and on the final day of the winter solstice are summoned to Hei'?wa kiva to receive their staves of office--the feathered staves which the impersonator of P?autiwa left there the night before.</p>
 <p>The men who are chosen must be known to be above reproach men of pure heart and kindly disposition, who will not neglect any of the taboos attaching to their office and who will be diligent in their prayers.</p>
 <p>Their duties begin the evening of the day on which they receive their sticks of office. Every day at sunrise they must offer meal to the sun with prayers for their people. They must go out of the village toward the cast for their prayer. Many Zuñis pray each morning, but on priests and impersonators of the gods this observance is obligatory. Every evening after dark they sacrifice food in the river to the west of the village.</p>
 <p>On their first evening following their appointment they start their nightly meetings with the trustees of their ritual to learn the long prayers and complicated rites connected with their office. These nightly meetings continue throughout the year until their days are fulfilled in November. The 10 Koyemci meet in the house of their father, the impersonators of the priests of the masked gods--Cula:witsi Sayataca, Hututu, the two Yamuhato meet in the house of the impersonator of Sayataca. The little boy Cula:witsi and his ceremonial father are required to attend only the four nights following the planting at the new moon. The Ca?lako impersonators meet formally only on these four nights each month, but hold informal meetings in between. The first prayer that is learned is the one that accompanies the monthly offerings of prayer sticks.</p>
 <p>At each full moon all the impersonators plant together at springs in the mountains south of Zuñi.</p>
 <p>On these days they gather early in the morning in their ceremonial houses to make their prayer sticks. Long prayers are recited at the conclusion of their work, Then after a feast they leave for the shrines, which lie to the south at a distance of 4 to 8 miles. The prayer sticks are deposited beside the spring in regular order, and</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. See p. 535]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 703}</p>
 <p>long prayers are offered. The impersonators of Sayataca recite the prayer, the others joining in according to the extent of their knowledge. Toward sunset the party approaches the village, marching in regular order across the plains, singing songs of the masked dancers.</p>
 <p>Throughout the year each group of impersonators must work for the household which is to entertain them a the great public festival. From midsummer on every day is spent in labor for their hosts. They do all the work of the fields and build the new home in which the gods are to be received.</p>
 <p>On the morning of the tenth planting, which takes place early in October, the impersonators of Sayataca and Molanhakto receive from the priest the two day counts--cotton strings containing 49 knots. One knot is untied each morning until the day of the great public ceremony. During this period there are plantings at intervals of 10 days at rock shrines to the southwest of the village.</p>
 <p>The public ceremonies start on the fortieth day,[2] with the arrival of the Koyemci in the evening. They come masked, visiting each of the four plazas to announce the coming of the gods in eight days. They then go into retreat in the house of their father, where they remain in seclusion, with the exception of appearances in the plaza, until the festival is concluded fifteen days later.</p>
 <p>Four days after the appearance of the Koyemci the Sayataca party come in in the evening and go into retreat in the house of the impersonator of Sayataca. On the same night the Ca?lako impersonators go into retreat in their respective houses.</p>
 <p>On the eighth day there is another planting of prayer sticks with elaborate ceremonies at which the gods are summoned from the village of the masked gods.</p>
 <p>After they are clothed and masked they approach the village. The giant Ca?lako gods wait on the south bank of the river but the priests of the masked gods--Cula:witsi, Sayataca, Hututu, two Yamuhakto, and two Salimopia--enter the village in mid afternoon. After planting prayer sticks in six excavations in the streets of the village they repair to the house where they are to be entertained for the night. This is always a new or at least a renovated house, and the visit of the gods is a blessing, a dedication. Prayer sticks are planted inside the threshold (formerly under the outside ladder) and in a decorated box suspended from the center of the ceiling. The walls of the house are marked with corn meal. In all excavations in the center of the floor seeds of all kinds are deposited. Similar rites are performed later in the evening by the six Ca?lako and the Koyemci in the houses where they are to be entertained.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[2. That is, if the ceremony is not postponed. However, almost without exception, a postponement of 10 days is necessary.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 704}</p>
 <p>After the blessing of the house the gods are seated by the p?ekwin, their masks raised. Reed cigarettes are brought and each god smokes with the person seated opposite him, exchanging with him the customary terms of relationship. Then the host (in the Sayataca house, the village chief serves as host) questions the gods concerning the circumstance of their coming. In the long recital that follows he reviews all the events leading up to the present moment, and invokes upon the house a the blessings of the gods, especially the blessing of fecundity.</p>
 <p>This litany chanted in unison by the four leaders (Cula:witsi is not required to learn it) takes about six hours to perform. It is chanted in loud tones and very slowly in monotone, except for the last syllable of each line, which is higher in pitch, heavily accented, and prolonged. The chants of the Ca?lako, which omit the recital of the 29 springs visited by the gods on their way to Zuñi and curtail other portions, take from one to two hours to perform.</p>
 <p>All are finished at about 11 o'clock at night, when an elaborate feast is served in all the houses. After this all the masked personages dance until day in the house of their hosts.</p>
 <p>At the first sign of approaching dawn Sayataca ascends to the roof of the house where he has spent the night, and facing the east, unties the last knot in his counting string while he intones another prayer. Returning to the house, he repeats the prayer. He then thanks the members of the society choir who furnished the music during the night. The dancing continues until sunrise, when the heads of all impersonators are washed by the women of the house where they were entertained, as a symbol of their permanent association with these houses.</p>
 <p>At about noon, after planting prayer sticks and performing magical ceremonies in a field on the south of the river, the Ca?lako gods and the Sayataca group depart for their home in the west. This closes their year, and the impersonators of the Sayataca group and the six Ca?lako are now free after the exacting period of service. The Koyemci, however, are not yet free. Throughout the year their duties have been heavier. They hold nightly meetings and participate in the monthly plantings of the other impersonators. Furthermore, at all of the dances of the summer series (six in all, lasting from one to eight days) they must come out and "play," observing all the usual taboos from the evening preceding the dance until the final departure. They may appear also in winter, and if they do must observe the same restrictions. If any extra dances are inserted into the calendar in the summer and fall, as frequently happens, the Koyemci are required to attend.</p>
 <p>For five nights following the departure of the Ca?lako gods, dancers from each of the six kivas are supposed to visit all the houses which have entertained the gods. Some of them dance in the plaza during</p>
 <p>{p. 705}</p>
 <p>the day. Throughout this period the Koyemci remain in strict retreat in the house where they were entertained. At night they dance in their house; during the day they "play" in the plaza and attend any dancers who appear there. These are days of great festivity.</p>
 <p>On the fifth evening they eat early and sparingly, and from this time on food and drink are taboo until the following night. Speech also is forbidden them, nor may they appear unmasked. After they enter upon this period the character of their dancing changes, becoming more solemn. They do not indulge in their usual obscenity. On the following morning they come out early and are taken to be washed in the house of the village chief. Here the women give them gifts of food. On coming out, they are taken by men of their fathers' clans to the houses of their fathers' sisters. Here they receive gifts from all members of the fathers' clan. Each impersonator will receive as many as thirty slaughtered sheep, as many baskets of corn or wheat flour, bread, melons, and miscellaneous gifts of clothing, frequently of great value. The gifts are brought to the plaza, where they remain until night. Meanwhile the Koyemci attend upon the various dancers until later at night.</p>
 <p>At nightfall the last of the dancers, the Molawia, have departed. Then the Koyemci, in pairs, visit every house in the village to invoke upon it the blessings of the gods. At each house they receive gifts of food from the female inhabitants. Returning to the plaza, they take their prayer sticks out to plant. They return to the house of their father late at night, and removing their masks for the first time all day give them to their father to return to the house where they are kept. When he comes back he thanks his children for their year of work and sets them free. Then for the first time since the preceding evening they drink, and after eating and bathing return to their homes. Their retreat, fifteen days, is the longest in Zuñi ritual.</p>
 <p>The following prayers are only a fragment of the whole ritual. In addition to those recorded there are long series of prayers spoken at the time, of appointment to office, for making prayer sticks, for offering corn meal to the sun (different in summer and winter) and food to the ancestors, for untying the knots of the day count, for each stage of dressing for the public ceremony, and for each offering of prayer sticks. In addition, the host and officials of the Katcina society have many long prayers.</p>
 <p>Each of the six Ca?lako impersonations has a different chant, and that of the Koyemci is again different.</p>

 We have now fulfilled their thoughts.<br>
 To this end: My fathers,<br>
 My mothers,<br>
 My children,<br>
 165 Always with one thought<br>
 May we live together.<br>
 With your waters,<br>
 Your seeds,<br>
 Your riches,<br>
 170 Your power,<br>
 Your strong spirit,<br>
 All your good fortune,<br>
 With all this may you bless us."</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">SAYATACA'S NIGHT CHANT</h2>
 <p>And now indeed it has come to pass.<br>
 When the sun who is our father<br>
 Had yet a little ways to go to reach his left-hand altar,[3]<br>
 Our daylight father,<br>
 P?ekwin of the Dogwood clan,<br>
 Desired the waters, the seeds<br>
 Of his fathers,<br>
 Priests of the masked gods.<br>
 Then our fathers,[4]<br>
 Sharing one another's desire, sat down together<br>
 In the rain-filled room<br>
 Of those that first came into being.[5]<br>
 Yonder following all the springs,<br>
 They sought those ordained to bring long life to man,[6]<br>
 Those that stand upright,<br>
 But (like the waters of the world),<br>
 Springing from one root, are joined together fast.[7]<br>
 At the feet of some fortunate one<br>
 Offering prayer meal,<br>
 Turquoise, corn pollen,<br>
 Breaking the straight young shoots,<br>
 With their warm human hands<br>
 They held them fast.<br>
 Taking the massed cloud robe of their grandfather, turkey man,<br>
 Eagle's mist garment,<br>
 The thin cloud wings and massed cloud tails<br>
 Of all the birds of summer,<br>
 With these four times clothing their plume wands,<br>
 They made the plume wands into living beings.<br>
 With the flesh of their mother,<br>
 Cotton woman,<br>
 Even a thread badly made,<br>
 A soiled cotton thread,[9]<br>
 Four times encircling their wand they made their belts;[10]<br>
 With rain-bringing prayer feathers<br>
 They made them into living beings.<br>
 With the flesh of their two mothers,<br>
 Black paint woman,<br>
 Clay woman,<br>
 Clothing their plume wands with flesh,<br>
 They made them into living beings.<br>
 When they said, "Let it be now,<br>
 The ones who are our fathers<br>
 Commissioned with prayers<br>
 The prayer wands that they had fashioned.<br>
 When the sun who is our father,<br>
 Had gone in to sit down at his ancient place,[11]<br>
 Then over toward the south,<br>
 Whence the earth is clothed anew,[12]<br>
 Our father, K^?äwulhia P?autiwa,[13]<br>
 Perpetuating what had been since the first beginning<br>
 Again assumed human form.[14]<br>
 Carrying his fathers' finished[15] plume wands<br>
 He made his road come hither.<br>
 Wherever he thought, "Let it be here,"<br>
 Into his fathers' rain-filled room,<br>
 He made his road to enter.<br>
 And when our sun father,<br>
 Had yet a little ways to go<br>
 To go in to sit down at his ancient place,<br>
 Yonder from all sides</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[3. I. e., the south, therefore, at the winter solstice.</p>

 <p>5. E'to:we, the fetishes of the priests.</p>
 <p>6. The red willow, the wood most commonly used for prayer sticks.</p>
 <p>7. According to Zuñi cosmology, springs are outlets of a system of underground waters. By analogy, a shrub whose shoots are joined to a common rootstock is used to bring rain.</p>
 <p>8. This one is not cut.</p>

 <p>13. Mrs. Stevenson calls him komosona (head of the masked god cult) of Kolhuwalawa. He is described as "the highest chief." None of the gods can come to Zuñi save by his order. The plans are made at the New Year, when he leaves the crooks for all the dancers.</p>
 <p>14. The impersonator dons the mask and becomes the god, and inversely the god assumes human form. As a matter of fact, in the evening the impersonator comes unmasked, the mask having previously been taken to the kiva.</p>

 From where he stays quietly,<br>
 Made his road come forth.<br>
 Making his road come hither,<br>
 Into his fathers' rain-filled room,<br>
 He made his road to enter.<br>
 With his wings,<br>
 His fathers' cloud house[17] he fashioned<br>
 Their bed of mist[17] he spread out,<br>
 Their life-giving road[18] Is of meal he sent forth<br>
 Their precious spring[19] he prepared.<br>
 When all was ready,<br>
 Our father, K^?äwulhia P?autiwa<br>
 Reaching his house chiefs,[20]<br>
 His p?ekwin<br>
 His bow priests,<br>
 He made his road to go in.<br>
 Following one road,<br>
 Sitting down quietly,<br>
 A blessed night<br>
 The divine ones<br>
 With us, their children, came to day.<br>
 Next day, when our sun father<br>
 Had come out standing to his sacred place,[21]<br>
 Saying, "Let it be now.<br>
 Over there to the south,<br>

 Our father, K^?äwulhia P?autiwa,<br>

 He made his road come forth.<br>
 He made his road come hither.<br>

 Four times he made his road encircle.[22]<br>
 Yonder wherever all his kiva children's rain-filled roads come out[23]<br>
 His precious plume wands<br>
 He laid down.<br>
 Then turning he went back to his own country.<br>
 My father picked up the prayer plume,<br>
 And with the precious prayer plume<br>
 Me he appointed.[24]<br>
 The moon, who is our mother,<br>

 And when standing fully grown against the eastern sky,[25]<br>
 She made her days,<br>
 For my fathers,<br>
 Rain maker priests,<br>
 Priests of the masked gods.<br>
 I fashioned prayer plumes into living beings.<br>
 My own common[26] prayer plume,<br>
 I fastened to the precious prayer plume of my fathers.<br>
 At the place since the first beginning called cotton hanging,<br>
 I brought my fathers[27] prayer plumes.<br>
 Drawing my prayer plumes toward them,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[16. An esoteric designation for the p?ekwin.</p>

 <p>20. The chief priesthood.</p>
 <p>21. Sunrise. P?autiwa enters the village just after sunset. in fact, by the time he has visited all the kivas. It is quite dark. However, the ceremonies on the plain, where he dresses, begin shortly after noon.</p>
 <p>22, P?autiwa in coming in at this time encircles the village four times in narrowing circles, symbolic of the search for the middle.</p>
 <p>33 At the hatchways of all the kivas; Pautiwa does not enter the kivas. He leaves the plume wands on the roofs. The description is of the leaving of the crooks for the six Ca?lako impersonations. The crooks for the Sayataca group and the Koyemci are brought to He'iwa kiva by the impersonator of Pautiwa when he comes unmasked for the night ceremonies of the New Year. They have already been distributed before his afternoon appearance with the Ca?lako crooks.</p>
 <p>34 The "Ca?lako crook" left by P?autiwa is taken by one of the kiva officials who is waiting in the kiva to receive it. He takes it home. Next evening members are summoned to his home for the ceremony of installation. The "crook" contains one long and two short sticks. The long stick and one short one are given to the man who volunteers to entertain the gods. The short stick is planted at the first full moon of the New Year. The long one is kept in the house until the last day of the Ca?lako festival, when it is given to the father of the Koyemci, who plants it with his own prayer sticks that night. The other short stick is given to the impersonator and is planted by him at the first full moon, as described in the following passage.</p>
 <p>35. At the full moon.</p>
 <p>36. Painted with common paint.</p>
 <p>37. His ancestors, the deceased impersonators of Sayataca, and the katcinas.]</p>

 <p>They spoke to those inside the place of our first beginning.[28]<br>
 Yonder following all the springs,<br>
 On all the mossy mountains,<br>
 In all the wooded places,<br>
 At the encircling ocean,<br>
 With my prayer plumes,<br>
 With my sacred meal,<br>
 With my sacred words,<br>
 They talked to those within.<br>
 Winter,<br>
 Summer,<br>
 Through the cycle of the months,<br>
 Though my prayer plumes were but poor ones,<br>
 There toward the south,<br>
 Wherever my fathers' roads come out[29]<br>
 I continued to give them prayer plumes.<br>
 And when the cycle of months was at an end<br>
 My fathers[30] made their rain roads come in<br>
 To their fathers,<br>
 Their mothers,<br>
 Those that first came into being.<br>
 Sharing one another's desire, they sat down together.<br>
 With the flesh of their mother,<br>
 Cotton woman,<br>
 Even a cord badly made,<br>
 A soiled cotton cord,<br>
 With this four times<br>
 They made the day counts[31] into living beings.<br>
 Saying, "Let it be now,"<br>
 They sent for me.<br>
 I came to my fathers,<br>
 Where they were waiting for me.<br>
 With their day count<br>
 They took hold of me fast.<br>
 Carrying their day count<br>
 I came back to my house.<br>
 Saying, "Let it be now,"<br>
 And carrying the prayer plumes which<br>
 I had prepared,<br>
 Yonder to the south<br>
 With prayers, I made my road go forth.<br>
 To the place ever since the first beginning called "Ants go in,"[32]<br>
 My road reached.<br>
 There where my fathers' water-filled roads come out,<br>
 I gave them plume wands;<br>
 I gave them prayer feathers;<br>
 There I asked for light for you.<br>
 That you may finish your roads,<br>
 That you may grow old,<br>
 That you may have corn,<br>
 That you may have beans,<br>
 That you may have squash,<br>
 That you may have wheat,<br>
 That you may kill game,<br>
 That you may be blessed with riches,<br>
 For all this I asked.<br>
 Then over toward the west[33]<br>
 Where the road of my fathers comes in,<br>
 I gave them plume wands.<br>
 And now, when all of their days were past,<br>
 Over toward the west,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[28. The rain makers.</p>
 <p>29. At various springs in the mountains south of Zuñi. At the present time these are visited in the following order: Uhanaa (snow hanging), January; Alhapatsi (rock wedge), February; At?sinakwi (painted rock), March; Picuk^?aia. (poison water weed spring), April; k^?änulha (mesa wall spring, lit., water against some thing), May; Toloknana, two plantings, in June and July; k^?ate:tci (evil smelling water), August; Opump?ia (sack of meal hanging), September; Ayayakya (bluebird), October (ko haito). The matter, however, is not so simple, and there are always arguments as to the dates and places of planting. The first planting need not be at the full moon. If the New Year is at the full moon the first planting maybe immediately after or delayed a month. If it takes place the end of January there is disagreement concerning the advisability of planting twice at Toloknana and as to whet tier the last planting at Ayayakya should be made at the full moon or the first quarter. The final decision rests with the personator of Sayataca. No matter when the plantings are made, it is always necessary at the end to postpone the festival because the houses are not ready. This is done after consultation with the p?ekwin, so that the dates may not conflict with his dates for the winter solstice.</p>
 <p>30. The priests.</p>
 <p>31. A cotton string containing 49 knots. Starting with the following morning, one knot is untied each morning, the last being untied at daybreak the morning the gods go out after their night of dancing in the houses. One such string is given to the Sayataca impersonator, one to the father of the Koyemci.</p>
 <p>32. Halon Kwaton, at the foot of Corn Mountain. M. C. Stevenson records ko haito as being made at this place. In 1927 and in preceding years this ceremony took place at Ayayakya, on the opposite side of the valley.</p>
 <p>33. Th plantings to the west are at intervals of 10 days They are not at springs.]</p>

 Where no one ever falls down,[35]<br>
 At the abiding place<br>
 Of those who are our children,[36]<br>
 There I met them on their roads.<br>
 There where the one who is my father<br>
 Had prepared my seat<br>
 Four times my father[37] sprinkled prayer meal.<br>
 On the crown of my head<br>
 Four times he sprinkled prayer meal.<br>
 And after he had sprinkled prayer meal on his rain seat,<br>
 Following him,<br>
 My prayer meal<br>
 Four times I sprinkled.<br>
 My father's rain seat<br>
 I stood beside.<br>
 My father took hold of me.<br>
 Presenting me to all the directions,[38] he made me sit down.<br>
 When I had sat down,<br>
 My father<br>
 Took his grandson,<br>
 Reed youth.<br>
 Within his body,<br>
 He bored a hole going through him.<br>
 Four times drawing toward him his bag of native tobacco<br>
 Into the palm of his hand<br>
 He measured out the tobacco.<br>
 Within his body<br>
 He placed mist.[39]<br>
 He took his grandmother[40] by the hand,<br>
 And made her sit down in the doorway.[41]<br>
 Having made her sit in the doorway,<br>
 Four times inhaling, he drew the mist through.<br>
 With the mist<br>
 He added to the hearts[42]<br>
 Of the rain maker priests of all directions.<br>
 It is well;<br>
 Praying that the rain makers<br>
 Might not withhold their misty breath,<br>
 With his prayers<br>
 He added to their hearts.<br>
 He handed it to me.<br>
 Four times inhaling,<br>
 Into my body<br>
 I made the mist pass through.<br>
 Then with the mist,<br>
 I added to the hearts of my fathers of all<br>
 the directions.<br>
 When this was at an end,<br>
 We greeted one another with terms of kinship:<br>
 Father,[43]<br>
 Son; elder brother, younger brother; uncle, nephew; grandfather, grand<br>
 son; ancestor, descendant.<br>
 With this many words we greeted one another.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 My father questioned me:<br>
 "Yes, now indeed<br>
 You have passed us on our roads.<br>
 Surely you will have something to say, some words that are not too long."<br>
 Thus he spoke to me.<br>
 "Yes, indeed it is so.<br>

 When I had spoken thus,<br>
 Hurriedly, without delay,<br>
 My father took hold of me.<br>
 From the very soles of my feet<br>
 Even to the crown of my head<br>
 He clothed me all over with all things needful.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 Then also with that which is called my belt,<br>

 He covered my navel.<br>
 With his bundle that covered it all over.<br>

 Having spoken thus,<br>
 He took hold of me.<br>
 Presenting me to all the directions he made me arise.<br>
 With his prayer meal<br>
 Four times he sprinkled his water filled ladder.<br>
 After him,<br>
 Four times I sprinkled my prayer meal.<br>
 Taking four steps,<br>
 Four times striding forward,<br>
 Standing, I came out.<br>
 [Having come out standing,<br>
 Yonder to all directions I looked;[51]<br>
 I looked toward the north,<br>
 I looked toward the west,<br>
 I looked toward the south,<br>
 I looked toward the east.<br>
 Hither, toward the place of dawn,<br>
 I saw four roads going side by side.<br>
 Along the middle road,<br>
 Four times my prayer meal I sprinkled.<br>
 There I made the sound of the water-filled breath of the priest of the north.[52]<br>
 Taking four steps,<br>
 Four times striding forward,<br>
 To the place known since the first beginning as Great Lake,[53]<br>
 My road came.<br>
 Where my father's road comes out<br>
 I stood in the doorway.<br>
 That which formed my belt,<br>
 My prayer meal,<br>
 Four times sprinkling inside,<br>
 I opened their curtain of scum.[54]<br>
 After that,<br>
 Four times sprinkling prayer meal inside<br>

 Four times sprinkling my prayer meal,<br>
 My father's rain seat<br>
 I stood beside.<br>
 As I stood up beside it<br>
 My father took hold of me,<br>
 Yonder to all the directions presenting me,<br>
 He made me sit down.<br>
 Having seated me<br>
 The one who is my father<br>
 Took the water bringing cigarettes which he had prepared.<br>
 Four times drawing it toward him,<br>
 He took his grandmother by the hand<br>
 And made her sit down in the doorway,<br>
 Four times inhaling, he drew the mist through.<br>
 With the mist<br>

 Rain maker priests.<br>
 Thus it is well; around,<br>

 Thus my father spoke.<br>
 When he had spoken thus,<br>
 He took hold of me.<br>
 Yonder to all the directions<br>
 Presenting me<br>
 He made me arise.<br>
 After he had made me arise<br>
 With his prayer meal<br>
 His water-filled ladder<br>
 He sprinkled.<br>
 After him sprinkling my prayer meal<br>
 Standing, I came out.][56]<br>
 Coming out standing<br>
 Yonder to all directions I looked.<br>
 I looked to the north,<br>
 I looked to the west,<br>
 I looked to the south,<br>
 I looked to the east,<br>
 Hither toward Itiwana [57] I saw four roads going side by side.<br>
 Along the middle road,<br>
 My prayer meal<br>
 Four times I sprinkled before me.<br>
 Then I made the sound of the rain-filled breath of the rain maker priest of the below.<br>
 Taking four steps,<br>
 Four times striding forward,<br>
 Where descends the watery road.<br>
 Of my daylight fathers,[58]<br>
 My daylight mothers,<br>
 I stood.<br>
 Then I consecrated[59] the place<br>
 Where my father's watery road descends.<br>
 That none of his children might fall from the ladder,[60]<br>
 Having still one rung left to go,<br>
 Having still two rungs left to go,<br>
 Having still three rungs left to go,<br>
 Having still four rungs left to go;<br>
 In order that none of his children should fall down<br>
 I consecrated the place where his watery road descends.<br>
 When all this was at an end<br>
 The one who is my father<br>
 On the crown of my head<br>
 Four times sprinkled prayer meal.<br>
 On his watery wood pile[61]</p>

 <p>Four times he threw prayer meal upward.<br>
 Then after him,<br>
 My prayer meal<br>
 Sprinkling before me,<br>
 Where my father's water-filled road ascends<br>
 I made my road ascend.<br>
 The one who is my father<br>
 Four times sprinkled prayer meal before him.<br>
 After him<br>
 Four times sprinkling prayer meal before me,<br>
 Standing, I came in.<br>
 As standing I came in<br>
 I could scarcely see all my fathers,<br>
 So full was his house.<br>
 Then my father's rain-filled room<br>
 I rooted at the north,[62]<br>
 I rooted at the west,<br>
 I rooted at the south,<br>
 I rooted at the east,<br>
 I rooted above,<br>
 Then in the middle of my father's roof,[63]<br>
 With two plume wands joined together,<br>
 I consecrated his roof.<br>
 This is well;<br>
 In order that my father's offspring may increase,<br>
 I consecrated the center of his roof.<br>
 And then also, the center of my father's floor,<br>
 With seeds of all kinds,<br>
 I consecrated the center of his floor.[64]<br>
 This is well;<br>
 In order that my father's fourth room<br>
 May be bursting with corn,<br>
 That even in his doorway,<br>
 The shelled corn may be scattered before the door,<br>
 The beans may be scattered before the door,<br>
 That his house may be full of little boys,<br>
 And little girls,<br>
 And people grown to maturity;<br>
 That in his house<br>
 Children may jostle one another in the doorway,<br>
 In order that it may be thus,<br>
 I have consecrated the rain-filled room<br>
 Of my daylight father,<br>
 My daylight mother.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 The one who is my father[65]<br>
 Four times sprinkled prayer meal<br>
 Where he had prepared my seat.<br>
 Following him,<br>
 Four times sprinkling prayer meal before me,<br>
 Where my father had prepared my seat,<br>
 I stood beside it.<br>
 My father took hold of me.<br>
 Presenting me to all the directions, he made me sit down.<br>
 After my father had seated me,<br>
 The rain invoking cigarette which he had prepared<br>
 My father drew toward him.<br>
 He took his grandmother by the hand<br>
 And made her sit in the doorway.<br>
 Having seated her in the doorway,<br>
 Four times inhaling he made the mist pass through;<br>
 Into his body<br>
 He drew the misty breath.<br>
 With the mist he added to the hearts of his fathers.<br>
 This is well:<br>
 That the rain makers may not withhold their misty breath,<br>
 With mist<br>
 He added to the hearts of his fathers.<br>

 This is well:<br>

 With mist I added to their hearts.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 We greeted one another with terms of kinship:<br>
 Father,<br>
 Son, elder brother, Younger brother; uncle, nephew; grandfather, grandson; ancestor, descendant.<br>
 With this many words we greeted one another.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 My daylight father questioned me:[66]<br>
 "Yes, now indeed<br>
 You have passed us on our roads,<br>
 The one whom all our fathers,<br>
 Desiring something,<br>
 Appointed at the New Year.<br>
 Yonder to the south<br>
 Wherever emerge the precious roads of our fathers,<br>
 Rain maker priests,<br>
 Rain maker P?ekwins,<br>
 Rain maker bow priests.<br>
 With your prayer plumes-poorly made though they were,<br>
 You have asked for light for us.<br>
 Now this day, the appointed time has come."<br>

 Now our fathers,<br>
 Cula:witsi, p?ekwin priest,[67]<br>
 Sayataca, bow priest,[68]<br>
 Hututu, bow priest,<br>
 The two Yamuhakto, bow priests,<br>
 Perpetuating their rite,<br>
 Have once more assumed human form.<br>
 Their seeds,<br>
 Their riches,<br>
 Their fecundity,<br>

 The seeds of the red corn,<br>
 The seeds of the white corn,<br>
 The seeds of the speckled corn,<br>
 The seeds of the black corn,<br>
 The seeds of the sweet corn,<br>
 All the clans of beans,<br>
 All the ancient round things,<br>
 The seeds of all the different trees,<br>
 The seeds of all the wild weeds,<br>
 I carry over my navel.<br>
 Those which we brought,<br>
 These seeds we now leave here<br>
 In the rain-filled rooms<br>
 Of our daylight fathers,<br>
 Our daylight mothers.<br>
 When in the spring,<br>
 Your earth mother is enriched with living waters,<br>
 Then in all your water-filled fields,<br>
 These, with which you will renew yourselves,<br>
 Your mothers,<br>
 All the different kinds of corn,<br>
 Within your earth mother<br>
 You will lay down.<br>
 With our earth mother's living waters<br>
 They will once more become living beings.<br>
 Into the daylight of our sun father<br>
 They will come out standing.<br>
 They will stand holding out their hand to all the directions,<br>
 Calling for water.<br>
 And from somewhere,<br>
 Our fathers with their fresh water<br>
 Will come to them.<br>
 Their fresh waters<br>
 They will drink in.<br>
 They will clasp their children in their arms;<br>
 Their young will finish their roads.<br>
 Into your house,<br>
 You will bring them,<br>
 To be your beloved ones.<br>

 Our fathers may meet their children;[69]<br>
 That going about, as they say,<br>

 (You may meet) antelope,<br>
 Mountain goats.<br>
 Does,<br>
 Bucks,<br>
 Jack rabbits,<br>
 Cottontails,<br>
 Wood rats,<br>

 With the flesh of these<br>
 You may satisfy your hunger.<br>

 In order that my daylight fathers' rain-filled rooms,<br>
 May be filled with all kinds of clothing,<br>
 That their house may have a heart,[70]<br>
 That even in his doorway<br>

 And men and women grown to maturity,<br>
 That in his house<br>

 Praying for whatever you wished,<br>
 Through the winter,<br>
 Through the summer,<br>

 I have prayed for light for you.<br>

 I have fulfilled their thoughts.<br>
 Perpetuating the rite of our father,<br>
 Sayataca, bow priest,<br>
 And giving him human form[71]<br>
 I have passed you on your roads.<br>
 My divine father's life-giving[72] breath,<br>

 His breath of seeds,<br>
 His breath of riches,<br>
 His breath of fecundity,[73]<br>
 His breath of power,<br>
 His breath of strong spirit,<br>
 His breath of all good fortune whatsoever,<br>

 And into my warm body<br>
 Drawing his breath,<br>
 I add to your breath now.<br>
 Let no one despise the breath of his fathers,<br>
 But into your bodies,<br>
 Draw their breath.<br>
 That yonder to where the road of our sun father comes out,<br>
 Your roads may reach;<br>
 That clasping hands,<br>
 Holding one another fast,<br>
 You may finish your roads,<br>
 To this end, I add to your breath now.<br>
 Verily, so long as we enjoy the light of day<br>
 May we greet one another with love;[74]<br>
 Verily, so long as we enjoy the light of day<br>
 May we wish one another well<br>
 Verily may we pray for one another.<br>
 To this end, my fathers,<br>
 My mothers,<br>
 My children:</p>

 <p>70. An empty house "has no heart." The heart of the house is anything which has been used by human beings.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">SAYATACA'S MORNING CHANT</h3>
 <p>And now indeed it has come to pass<br>
 This past day,<br>
 I stood beside the water-filled ladder<br>
 Of my daylight fathers,<br>
 My daylight mothers,<br>
 My daylight children.<br>
 8 We who had stood there,<br>
 In the rain-filled room<br>
 Of our daylight fathers,<br>
 Staying quietly we came to day.<br>
 12 Now our dawn fathers,<br>
 Dawn old men,<br>
 Dawn youths,<br>
 Dawn boys,<br>
 Dawn old women,<br>
 Dawn matrons,<br>
 Dawn maidens,<br>
 Dawn girls,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[79. At the first sign of dawn Sayataca with p?ekwin ascends to the roof of the house and unties the last knot in the counting string, as a sign that his year is ended. He chants the following prayer, stretching out the string at the end of each line. The prayer is afterwards repeated in the house.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 757}</p>
 <p>20 Rising, standing at their sacred place,<br>
 Have come to meet us now.<br>
 My children,[80]<br>
 There in the rain-filled rooms<br>
 Of your daylight fathers,<br>
 Your daylight mothers<br>
 You have stayed throughout the night.<br>
 27 Finally, my children,<br>
 Make haste now,<br>
 Get ready now.<br>
 30 Yesterday our daylight fathers,[81]<br>
 Whoever of them wished to grow old,<br>
 Working on plume wands came to evening;<br>
 Working on prayer feathers they came to evening.<br>
 And furthermore our mothers,[82]<br>
 35 Whoever of them wished to grow old,<br>
 In order to add to the hearts of their ancestors,<br>
 Their children,[83]<br>
 40 Sitting weary by the fireplaces,<br>
 They came to evening.<br>
 With aching knees,<br>
 With sweat running down their faces,<br>
 With burned fingers,<br>
 Sitting wearily they came to evening.<br>
 45 And whoever else wished to grow old,<br>
 Preparing prayer meal[84]<br>
 They gave it to us.<br>
 Taking only that,<br>
 The plume wands they gave us,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[80. The other impersonators, including the Ca?lako, but not the Koyemci, who do not leave for six days. As a matter of fact, the dancing continues in all the houses until broad daylight. In Mrs. Stevenson's day this prayer closed the ceremonies.</p>
 <p>81. The priests and the men of the house and their close relatives (in 1927 several members of the clan of the house) make prayer sticks for all members of the Sayataca party.</p>
 <p>82. The women who cook for the feast, the women of the house, their blood relatives, members of their clan.</p>
 <p>83. Before the food is eaten in the night each of the seven impersonators takes a bit from each dish. All go out together and bury the food at Wide River, as an offering to a:lhacina:we. (See M. C. Stevenson for a different account.) The food was not buried under the ladder in 1927.</p>
 <p>84 The gods are sprinkled with meal by all observers during their progress around the village in the afternoon of their entrance.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 758}</p>
 <p>50 The food[85] which they cooked for us, and gave us to take along.<br>
 Taking only that,<br>
 We shall make our roads descend.[86]<br>
 With the song cycles of our fathers,[87] yonder,<br>
 Life-giving priests,<br>
 55 Life-giving p?ekwins,<br>
 Life-giving bow priests,<br>
 We danced the night away.<br>
 Now at last, my children,<br>
 60 Hasten now,<br>
 Get ready now.<br>
 At the new year<br>
 All my fathers<br>
 With their precious plume wand<br>
 65 Appointed me.<br>
 There to the south<br>
 Following where come out the<br>
 roads of my fathers,<br>
 Rain-makers, priests,<br>
 70 Even with my own poorly made plume wands,<br>
 I continued to give my fathers plume wands.<br>
 And when all the cycle of their months was at an end,<br>
 75 At the place called since the first beginning Ayayak^a[88]<br>
 Meeting my fathers,<br>
 I gave them plume wands.<br>
 Their day count having been counted up,<br>
 80 There to the west,<br>
 Where my fathers' road comes in,<br>
 I continued to give them plume wands.<br>
 When all these days were past,<br>
 86 The one who is my father<br>
 Took hold of me;<br>
 Where he had laid a seat<br>
 Four times he sprinkled prayer meal upon it.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[85. The bowls of food from which the offerings are made during the night are immediately taken by the girls of the house to the houses of the impersonators, as a gift from the house. This is also done in the morning, when other gifts are also taken, a butchered sheep, piece of calico, and sometimes blankets.</p>
 <p>86. That is, go out. When they come in they "climb up" (the ladder).</p>

 Where his seat was laid<br>
 He took hold of me.<br>
 Presenting me to all the directions,<br>
 He made me sit down.<br>
 95 Taking his grandson,<br>
 Reed youth,<br>
 Within his body,<br>
 Four times he bored a hole going through.<br>
 Four times drawing toward him his bag of native tobacco.<br>
 100 He put his hand in.<br>
 Into the palm of his hand<br>
 Four times he measured out tobacco.<br>
 Into his body,<br>
 Four times he stuffed the mist.<br>
 105 He took his grandmother by the hand,<br>
 Four times inhaling he drew the mist through;<br>
 Into his body<br>
 He drew the misty breath,<br>
 Yonder on all sides<br>
 110 With mist he added to the hearts of his fathers.<br>
 He handed it to me.<br>
 Four times inhaling I made the mist pass through.<br>
 Into my body<br>
 I drew the mist.<br>
 115 Yonder on all sides.<br>
 With mist I added to the hearts of my fathers.<br>
 This is well:<br>
 120 That the rain makers may not withhold their misty breath,<br>
 With mist I added to their hearts.<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 Then we greeted one another with terms of kinship:<br>
 Father, son; elder brother, younger brother; uncle, nephew; grandfather, grandson, ancestor, descendant,</p>
 <p>{p. 760}</p>
 <p>125 With this many words we greeted one another.<br>
 When all this was at an end<br>
 My father questioned me:<br>
 Indeed now it seems you will have something to say, some word that is not too long<br>
 130 So finally, if you let me know it,<br>
 I shall know it for all time."<br>
 Thus my fathers spoke.<br>
 135 "Yes indeed it is so.<br>
 There to the south,<br>
 Following where my fathers' watery roads come forth<br>
 I have been asking for light for you.<br>
 140 Yesterday we reached the appointed time.<br>
 Perpetuating the rite of the one who is our father,<br>
 Sayataca, bow priest,<br>
 And once more giving him human form<br>
 145 I came out standing.<br>
 I looked to the north,<br>
 I looked to the west,<br>
 I looked to the south,<br>
 I looked to the east,<br>
 150 Hither, toward the place of dawn,<br>
 I saw four road going side by side.<br>
 Along the middle road.<br>
 Four times I sprinkled prayer meal.<br>
 155 Then I made the sound of the water-filled breath of the rain maker priest of the north.<br>
 Taking four steps,<br>
 Four times striding forward,<br>
 The water filled woodpile<br>
 Of my daylight father<br>
 160 I stood beside.<br>
 My father<br>
 Four times sprinkled my head with prayer meal.</p>
 <p>{p. 761}</p>
 <p>166 His rain filled woodpile,<br>
 He sprinkled with meal.<br>
 After him,<br>
 170 I sprinkled my prayer meal on it.<br>
 This night<br>
 The thoughts of all my fathers,<br>
 Whatever they wished<br>
 When they appointed me with their precious plume wand,<br>
 I have fulfilled.<br>
 The breath of my father,<br>
 Sayataca, bow priest,<br>
 180 His life-giving breath<br>
 His breath of old age<br>
 His breath of waters,<br>
 His breath of fecundity,<br>
 His breath of seeds,<br>
 185 His breath of riches,<br>
 His breath of power,<br>
 His breath of strong spirit,<br>
 His breath of all good fortune whatsoever,--<br>
 Asking for his breath,<br>
 190 And into my body<br>
 Drawing his breath.<br>
 I add to your breath now.<br>
 And furthermore, the yellow clothing bundle of the priest of the north,<br>
 The blue clothing bundle of the priest of the west,<br>
 195 The red clothing bundle of the priest of the south,<br>
 The white clothing bundle of the priest of the east,<br>

 The dark colored clothing bundle of the priest of the below,<br>
 All kinds of good fortune whatsoever,--<br>
 200 Asking for the breath of these,<br>
 And into my warm body<br>
 Inhaling their breath,<br>
 I add to your breath.<br>
 To this end, my children:<br>

 May your roads be fulfilled;<br>
 May you grow old;<br>

 <font size="2"><p>[92. The host sits opposite the impersonator, and together they smoke a cigarette of native tobacco, and passing the cigarette back and forth, exchange terms of relationship. There are certain peculiarities in the terms used. Talemo: tale, brother's son, any male whose father belongs to my clan, hence, "my son," man speaking. There is no term for son. tca'le, "child" is use in describing a relationship; tsawak^: "youth," in referring to a person. This is not a term of relationship. Alemo: used only in this connection. Ordinarily nana is used reciprocally for grandfather, grandson. Toclemo, uwak^ämo used only in this connection. There are no equivalents. Possibly these, and alemo, are obsolete terms. They do not always appear in the same order in the texts. (See pp. 713, 732.) The vocative suffix, too, is used only thus. A man, in receiving a present, always in receiving a gift of tobacco, will say tatcumo or papamo, to which the answer is talemo or suwemo. To a woman he sometimes says kukumo (elder sister). She answers hanimo (younger brother or sister) or ta'lemo (brother's son).]<br>

 Now, indeed, it has come to pass.<br>
 At the New Year<br>
 All my fathers[92]<br>
 Prepared precious plume wands.<br>

 With sacred words,<br>
 They commissioned them,<br>
 When our sun father<br>
 Had gone in to sit down at his ancient place,<br>
 10 After a blessed night<br>
 They came to day.<br>
 Next day<br>
 When our sun father<br>
 15 Coming out standing to his ancient place,<br>

 Four times drew toward them<br>

 Over to the south<br>
 He made his road go.<br>

 Perpetuating what has been since the first beginning,<br>
 Once more he assumed human form.<br>
 Carrying his father's plume wands<br>

 To his own country<br>
 45 He made his road go forth.<br>
 Then our fathers[95] <br>
 Drawing toward them their plume wands,<br>
 To their own houses<br>
 Made their roads return.<br>

 Eagerly they have awaited the time.<br>
 Among all their ladder descending children [96]<br>

 And though we were ignorant<br>
 (They sent for us [97])<br>
 55 Then those who are our fathers<br>
 Passed us on their roads.<br>

 Our fathers drew toward them<br>

 We made our roads go.<br>
 At the place called since the first beginning<br>
 Snow hanging,<br>
 85 We met our fathers on their roads.<br>
 Where their watery roads come forth[2]<br>
 We stood in the doorway.<br>
 90 There we gave our fathers plume wands,<br>
 We gave them prayer feathers,<br>
 We gave them rain-bringing cigarettes,<br>
 We gave them prayer meal.<br>

 Whenever the time came,<br>

 Prepared rain seats for us.<br>

 Took hold of us.<br>
 Presenting us to all the directions he made us sit down.<br>
 We sat quietly;<br>
 We waited for his words.<br>
 210 Our father four times drew toward him<br>
 The rain cigarette which he had prepared.<br>
 Taking his grandmother by the hand,<br>
 He made her sit in the doorway.<br>
 215 Four times the mist passed through.<br>
 With the mist,<br>
 We added to the hearts of our fathers,<br>
 Our beloved ones of all the directions,<br>
 Asking for the waters<br>
 Of our fathers of all the directions<br>
 When all this was at an end,<br>
 Into our bodies<br>
 We drew the misty breath.<br>
 225 Drawing in our breath<br>
 With the terms of kinship<br>
 We greeted one another:<br>
 Father, son; elder brother, younger brother; uncle, nephew; grandfather, grandson; great-grandfather, great-grandson,<br>
 Thus we greeted one another.</p>
 <p>{p. 769}</p>
 <p>When all this was at an end,<br>

 Questioned me:<br>
 "Yes, now, even now,<br>
 You have passed us on our roads.<br>
 Surely because of some words of our fathers,<br>
 Spoken at the New Year,<br>
 235 Because of some words of importance, some word that is not too long,<br>
 You have passed us on our roads.<br>
 So finally, if you let us know that,<br>
 Thinking always of that,<br>
 We shall pass our days."<br>
 240 Thus our father spoke to us, did he not?[8]<br>
 --Even so.--<br>
 "Yes, indeed it is true.<br>
 This many days<br>
 Throughout the winter,<br>
 245 Throughout the summer,<br>
 There to the south,<br>
 We brought you plume wands,<br>
 Wherever your roads come out,<br>
 Though our plume wands were but poorly made,<br>

 We brought you prayer feathers,<br>
 We brought you rain cigarettes.<br>

 Thus we said to our father, did we not?<br>
 --Even so.--<br>
 When we had spoken thus<br>
 (Our father spoke.)<br>
 260 "Indeed, these are your days.<br>
 Now that we have remembered your days<br>
 You have come to us,<br>
 My two children."<br>
 Saying this,<br>
 Our father took hold of us.<br>

 When he had made us ready Four times<br>
 With our cover of thin clouds[9] he fitted us.<br>
 When he had reached the end, (he spoke):<br>
 275 "This is all.<br>

 You have passed us on our road.<br>
 When our sun father<br>
 Has gone in to sit down at his ancient place,<br>
 And when our night fathers,<br>

 Have raised their dark curtain,<br>

 320 He made us arise.<br>

 Four times he sprinkled prayer meal,<br>
 325 On his rain-filled woodpile<br>
 He sprinkled prayer meal for us.<br>
 After him,<br>
 330 We sprinkled our prayer meal.<br>
 Then the one who is our father<br>

 He sprinkled for us.<br>
 Four times sprinkling prayer meal going out,<br>
 335 Stepping up four times,<br>
 We came out standing.<br>
 Yonder toward a directions we looked.<br>
 Hither toward Halona Itiwana,[10]<br>
 We saw four roads going side by side.<br>
 340 Along the middle path sprinkling prayer meal before us,<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">"WASHING" THE KOYEMCI</h2>
 <p>The Koyemci are actually bathed in the house of the priests, and each receives a gift of food from each of the women who participate in the ceremony, the wives and daughters of priests of the council. Later at the houses of their "aunts" they are also "washed." Here the rite is entirely symbolic. Corn meal is sprinkled on the head and gifts are presented. This, too, is called "washing." Ritual washing of the head is always the function of the paternal aunt.</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">DISMISSAL OF THE KOYEMCI</h2>
 <p>The Koyemci remain all day in the plaza in attendance on the various sets of dancers. At nightfall the last of the dancers, the Molawia, have departed. Then the Koyemci in pairs visit every house in the village, to invoke upon it the blessings of the gods. At each house they receive gifts of food from the female inhabitants. Returning to the plaza, they take their prayer sticks out to plant. They return to the house of their father late at night, and removing their masks for the first time all day give them to their father to return to the house where they are kept. When he comes back, he thanks his children for their year of work, and sets them free. Then for the first time since the preceding evening they drink, and after eating and bathing, return to their homes. Their retreat, fifteen days, is the longest in Zuñi ritual. The following is the prayer of the father of the Koyemci, setting them free.</p>

 <h1 align="CENTER">VII. PRAYERS OF THE MEDICINE CULT</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">THE GREAT FIRE SOCIETY CHIEF SETS UP HIS ALTAR</h2>
 <p>The Great Fire Society convenes for the first time in November at the full moon. Before sunset the male members assemble at their ceremonial house. The women bring food to the house and leave their sacred corn fetishes to be placed on the altar. The tablet altar has been set up against the west wall of the room. At sunset the choir begins to sing very softly a set of eight songs known as "For Pouring in the Water." At the beginning of the fourth song two men go out to offer food in the river. The society pekwin rises and makes the meal painting and sets up the corn fetishes. At the fifth song the society chief takes the bowl for the medicine water, at the sixth he mixes the medicine, at the seventh he puts in sacred colored pebbles, during the eighth he "smokes" the altar. The following prayer is spoken in a low voice by the society chief while performing these rites.</p>
 <p>The procedure is followed whenever the society altar is set up. It is followed by a rite of exorcism which leads into the main body of the ceremony. It is about the same for all societies. The peculiar style of the following prayer may be due to the fact that it is accompanied by song.</p>
 <p>This many are the days<br>
 Since our moon mother<br>
 Yonder in the west,<br>
 As a small thing became visible.<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">SUMMONING A SHAMAN</h2>
 <p>When anyone is sick and it is decided to call a shaman to cure him, the family decide whether or not they consider the case sufficiently serious to warrant summoning one of the societies to come as an organization to perform its curing ritual. This is done only when they believe death is threatened and it is felt that the full power of the society is needed to save the patient's life. In such cases the patient is given to the society, and the family undertakes to see that he is initiated within a reasonable time. This is a last resort, since the expense of initiation is very great.</p>
 <p>In less serious cases a shaman is summoned to practice as an individual. In such a case the shaman may ask assistance of some colleague who owns an especially potent song or medicine, but the society as a whole does not participate, nor is the patient initiated. However, at the following New Year he goes to the house of the society with which his doctor is affiliated and his head is washed at their altar,</p>
 <p>{p. 792}</p>
 <p>and he becomes their "child." Each year at the winter solstice his society father, the shaman, makes a prayer stick for him to plant.</p>
 <p>Before the physician is summoned the patient's relatives decide what they will offer him for his services. The gift is held ready. Then the patient's father or some other mature male relative prepares prayer meal, which he wraps in a corn husk. Into this he puts some bit of the gift for the physician--a thread from a robe, or a bit of the fringe if it is a shawl. This is for the Beast Gods, their "clothing." With this he goes to the house of the shaman. The two men sit down, remove their headbands and moccasins, clasping hands over the package of meal. The patient's father repeats the following prayer, to which the shaman replies in like spirit:[16]</p>
 <p>This day,<br>
 Because of the ill will of the foolish ones,[17]<br>
 Our child wears out his spirit.<br>
 5 Among all our fathers,<br>

 <font size="2"><p>[21. Sawanikä, weapons, also, abstractly, power. There is a double meaning to these lines. The shaman will actually remove from the patient's body foreign matter which the witch has injected, and which is the direct cause of the sickness. Also, by revealing the means the witch has employed, he strips him of his power. For this reason torture formerly was used to extract confessions from those suspected of witchcraft. If a witch once reveals the source of his power he becomes helpless. Any prayer or ritual loses its potency when it is told, the power passing to the new owner. See pp. 493-494.</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">THE SOCIETY FATHER SUMMONS THE NOVICE FOR HIS INITIATION</h2>
 <p>If the patient has been given to the society he is expected to complete his initiation as soon as economic obligations permit. Should he fail in this he is troubled with bad dreams as a warning of the fate that will overtake him. Initiation is in no sense a propitiatory rite; it is, rather, an access to power. The preliminary ceremonies held at his sick bed secured him a stay, but in order finally to triumph over the disease, the patient must place himself under the protection of the Beast Gods and receive from them a new heart. Should he not do this, he will be troubled in spirit until he sickens and dies. Worry is the most serious of all illnesses, it is the sickness of the spirit caused by supernatural agencies.</p>
 <p>Frequently many years elapse before a man is in a position to meet the expenses of initiation. Whenever he is ready his family notify the society father, who is the man who received him as a patient. At the first fall meeting of the society the date for the initiation is set at the full moon of the month at which that society customarily initiates.</p>
 <p>Four days before the full moon the ceremonial father goes after sunset to the house of the novice to notify him that the initiation ceremonies are about to begin. Here the boy's family are assembled and waiting for him. After formal greetings are exchanged, the man sits down, removes his head band and moccasins and prays.[24a]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[24. The house of the society. Had the man been offering the child for initiation into the society he would say instead of "at your house," "in your spring."</p>

 <p>This many are the days<br>
 Since some evil thing<br>
 Made our child sick.<br>
 His breath failed.<br>

 With prayers, I made my road go forth.<br>
 Where our fathers' road comes in[25]<br>

 Standing facing them,<br>
 I offered them prayer meal.<br>
 The divine ones' road preceded;<br>

 Following them<br>
 Hither with prayers.<br>
 We brought our roads<br>
 35 Into their daylight children's rain filled rooms,[26]<br>
 The divine ones brought their road.<br>
 They sat down quietly<br>
 And we of the daylight<br>
 40 Met one another.<br>
 Our prayer meal,<br>
 Shells,[27]<br>
 Riches,<br>
 On which I had breathed our prayers,</p>

 For the second time<br>
 With prayers<br>

 Where my father's life-giving road comes in<br>
 Standing facing them,<br>
 I offered them prayer meal.<br>
 65 Thus anxiously waiting,<br>
 We have passed our days.[29]<br>
 Then when all their days were past,[30]<br>
 After our moon mother,<br>
 At her sacred place,<br>
 70 Still small, appeared,<br>
 And now yonder in the east<br>

The ceremonies are held for four consecutive nights, and last from midnight until dawn.</p>
 <p>30 The days of waiting until the novice was ready to assume his obligations.</p>

From the time of the planting until the conclusion of the ceremonies he must do no work, especially lift no heavy weights. He eats and sleeps very little and is untouchable, like one who has had contact with the dead.

 <h2 align="CENTER">THE SOCIETY FATHER BLESSES THE NOVICE AT THE CLOSE OF HIS INITIATION</h2>
 <p>On the following morning the members of the society make prayer sticks at their society house. They plant late in the afternoon and go into retreat in their ceremonial room. The novice has prayer sticks made by his ceremonial father, with whom he goes to plant at Badger Place. He observes a strict retreat in his own house. Each night he is brought to the society room to practice dancing and to be purified for his initiation.</p>
 <p>Each member of the society makes prayer sticks for the novice to plant the last day. His father prepares his mi?le, the feathered ear of corn which will be his personal fetish, his medicine bag, and the eagle feathers that form part of his regalia. He makes or purchases the hand-woven blue breechcloth which forms his ceremonial costume. At the boy's house preparations for the feast are under way.</p>
 <p>On the fourth night he is summoned by his father. At the society house he is clothed and his face and body are painted with sacred paint. Then he is brought into the ceremonial room to meet his fathers, the Beast Gods. He dances all night with two women of the clan of his ceremonial father. At dawn the two women wash his head at the altar, while the choir calls his new name. At the conclusion of this the ceremonial father hands the boy the medicine bag, eagle feathers, four ears of corn which have been lying on the altar, the mi?le, and the bundle of prayer sticks. They clasp bands over these sacred objects while the father repeats a long prayer, reviewing the events which have led up to this moment. At the conclusion all inhale the blessing of the newly consecrated mi?le.</p>
 <p>The boy takes his sacred possession to his house and returns to the society room, where his relatives serve a sumptuous feast. About noon he goes with his ceremonial father and the head of the society to a shrine on Badger Place where be plants the bundle of prayer sticks. Then for four days he must abstain from animal food in addition to the usual requirements of sexual continence and gentleness. On the fourth morning his father takes him out toward the east and removes from his hair the downy feather which he has worn as a pledge of his abstinence. He takes the boy to his house, where his head is washed by his wife. On this day there are elaborate exchanges of</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[30. The man leaves at once. The women of the boy's family immediately start preparations for his initiation, including the preparation of food for the two great feasts they must provide, and the grinding of meal to be given to his ceremonial father.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 803}</p>
 <p>gifts of food between the women of the boy's family and those of the father's.</p>
 <p>The following prayer, dictated by a member of the Great Fire Society, is said by the ceremonial father at the presentation of the mi?le, at the moment when he receives the novice into full membership in the society.</p>
 <p>Now this many are the days<br>

 <p>And taking our child's prayer meal,[61]<br>
 Yonder with prayer<br>
 One by one we made our roads go forth.<br>
 Meeting our earth mother,<br>
 And meeting our ancestors,<br>
 Our children,<br>
 Those who here belonged to societies,<br>
 And furthermore our fathers,<br>
 The Beast bow priests,<br>
 We offered them plume wands.<br>
 When there remained yet a little space.<br>
 Ere our sun father,<br>
 Went in to sit down at his sacred place,<br>
 From far off on all sides<br>
 Our fathers,<br>
 Life giving priests,<br>
 The divine ones,<br>
 With not one missing,<br>
 Making their roads come forth,<br>
 They made their roads come hither.<br>
 Into the rain-filled rooms of their daylight mothers,<br>
 They made their roads enter.[62]<br>
 Perpetuating their rite<br>
 According to the first beginning,<br>
 They fashioned their cloud house,<br>
 They spread out their mist blanket,<br>
 They sent forth their life-giving road,<br>
 They fashioned their spring,<br>
 They spanned their rainbow bow,<br>
 They set their lightning arrow,<br>
 They sat down quietly,<br>
 And at their feet we sat down.<br>
 This many days<br>
 Anxiously we have waited.[63]<br>
 Now, indeed, when the last of all their days was past,<br>
 Our child having made his road come in,[64]<br>
 Even where the precious road of his fathers enters,<br>
 Into a being like themselves<br>
 Our fathers transformed[65] their child.<br>
 Then a blessed night they spent<br>
 With us who are their children.<br>
 Next day,<br>
 While yet a little space remained<br>
 Ere our sun father<br>
 Should come out standing to his sacred place,<br>
 With our clear water,<br>
 With that by which we have being,<br>
 With this we took hold of our child.[66]<br>
 After the divine ones first added their breath,<br>
 Then also praying in the same words,<br>
 We added to the breath of our child.<br>
 Our child taking his fathers' breath,<br>
 Into his body will draw their breath.<br>
 And since our breath is valuable,<br>
 Where he sees our spring,<br>
 Even there he will sit down among us;<br>
 Then seeking always the ways of prolonging life,<br>
 With thoughts bent on this, we shall live.<br>
 Then also, that on following this we may bend our thoughts,<br>
 For this in plain words I sent forth my prayers.<br>
 He give us this child<br>
 That for a long time<br>
 In bonds of affection<br>
 We may live together,<br>
 These clear words were spoken,[67]<br>
 And to your fathers,<br>
 Wherever they stay,<br>
 You sent your clear words forth.<br>
 Indeed, even while I call myself poor,<br>
 Far off on all sides,<br>
 I have as my fathers life-giving priests.<br>
 Asking for their life-giving breath,<br>
 Their breath of old age,<br>
 Their breath of waters,<br>
 Their breath of seeds,<br>
 Their breath of riches<br>
 Their breath of fecundity,<br>
 Their breath of strong spirit,<br>
 Their breath of power,<br>
 Their breath of all good fortune whereof they are possessed,<br>
 Asking for their breath,</p>

 </font><h2 align="CENTER">PRAYER OF A SOCIETY CHIEF DURING HIS WINTER RETREAT</h2>
 <p>At the winter solstice all the societies observe retreats. After the images of the war god have gone into the kiva on the night before the first great prayer stick planting they hold late meetings at which special prayers are said for rain. There are special and very secret songs that are sung on this night only. They do not go into retreat formally until the next night. Three nights are spent mainly in preparation</p>
 <p>{p. 828}</p>
 <p>for the great ceremony of the last night at which the sick are cured. On this night the beast gods are present in all the society houses, and take possession of those who have the secret knowledge of how to invoke them.</p>
 <p>The following prayers purport to be those spoken by the heads of the Cuma:kwe and Ant Societies, respectively, at some time during this four-day retreat. The man who dictated it was not a member of either society and did not state the precise use of the prayers. Nor were my other informants familiar with them. Such prayers might be used on any one of a great number of occasions.</p>
 <p>My life-giving fathers,<br>

 So that none of my spring children<br>
 May be left standing outside.<br>
 So that you may protect us (I have done this).<br>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYERS FOR COLLECTING MEDICINE (CACTUS SOCIETY)</h2>
 <p>The expedition for gathering medicine roots camps the first night about sixteen miles east of Zuñi. Before eating, the customary offerings of food are set aside. After singing four songs, the head of the expedition prays:</p>
 <p>Now this night,<br>
 Our night fathers.<br>
 Our mothers,</p>
 <p>{p. 831}</p>
 <p>5 Rising a little, have come standing to their sacred place.<br>
 The song sequence of our fathers<br>
 You have heard.<br>
 You who are our fathers,<br>
 10 Beast bow priests,<br>
 Your hand leading,<br>
 Our hands following,<br>
 Desiring your medicine,<br>
 Hither we take our roads.<br>
 15 Do not think to withhold it from us because of something,<br>
 For verily,<br>
 Desiring my fathers' flesh,<br>
 That by which my children may fulfill their thoughts,<br>
 20 To-morrow, throughout a good day,<br>
 A beautiful day,<br>
 With us your children<br>
 You will come to evening.<br>
 25 And when that day shall have passed,<br>
 Anxiously waiting,<br>
 We shall pass our days.</p>
 <p>He takes the offering, burns it at a little distance from camp, and sitting down, waits for some omen.</p>
 <p>Now this night<br>
 Our night fathers,<br>
 30 Our mothers,<br>
 Rising a little have come standing to their sacred place.<br>
 Bringing food<br>
 Hither with prayers<br>
 35 We made our road come forth.<br>
 Wherever, thinking "Let it be here,"<br>
 Our earth mother,<br>
 We passed on her road.<br>
 Sitting down on the bare ground,<br>
 (We came to you,)<br>
 40 Our ancestors,<br>
 The ones who here used to belong to societies,<br>
 The ones who used to understand medicine,<br>
 You who now have attained the<br>
 far off place of waters;</p>
 <p>{p. 832}</p>
 <p>Having passed you on your roads,<br>
 45 We shall add to your hearts.<br>
 Adding to your hearts<br>
 Your long life,<br>
 Your old age,<br>
 Your waters,<br>
 50 Your seeds,<br>
 Your medicine<br>
 You will grant to us,<br>
 How the days will be<br>
 You will make known to us.<br>
 55 Knowing that, we shall live.</p>
 <p>After praying, he waits for an omen. Next day they look for the plants. A young man going for the first time gives his ceremonial father a package of prayer meal, saying:</p>
 <p>Now this day,<br>
 Our sun father<br>
 60 Having come out standing to his sacred place,<br>
 And having yet a little ways to go,<br>
 To go in to sit down at his other sacred place,<br>
 Bringing prayer meal which I have prepared,<br>
 65 Here near by,<br>
 At the very edge of the wilderness,<br>
 I have passed you on your road.<br>
 Desiring our fathers' medicine<br>
 We hold one another fast.<br>
 Desiring the medicine of our ancestors,<br>
 The ones who here belonged to societies,<br>
 The ones who used to understand medicine,<br>
 The beast priests.<br>
 75 Desiring their medicines,<br>
 With prayer meal,<br>
 With shells,<br>
 With rich clothing,<br>
 We hold one another fast.<br>
 80 My father,<br>
 You will cleanse your thoughts,<br>
 You will cleanse your heart,<br>
 So that somehow we may be the<br>
 children of the divine ones.</p>
 <p>{p. 833}</p>
 <p>85 Perhaps, if we are fortunate,<br>
 Because of our thoughts<br>
 Our spring children may multiply.[70]<br>
 Among all the little boys<br>
 And all the little girls,<br>
 90 And those whose roads go ahead,<br>
 Our spring children have multiplied.<br>
 In order that this toward which our thoughts bend may be accomplished,<br>
 Desiring our fathers' medicine,<br>
 95 We have made our roads come hither.<br>
 My father,<br>
 For you I have finished all these words.<br>
 Even while I call myself poor,<br>
 Yonder on all sides<br>
 From those whom my thoughts embrace,<br>
 100 I shall ask for light;<br>
 I shall add to your breath.<br>
 Asking for the breath of the priest of the north,<br>
 The priest of the west,<br>
 The priest of the south,<br>
 105 The priest of the east,<br>
 The priest of above,<br>
 The priest of below.<br>
 Asking for their life-giving breath,<br>
 Their breath of old age,<br>
 110 Their breath of waters,<br>
 Their breath of seeds,<br>
 Their breath of fecundity,<br>
 Their breath of riches,<br>
 Their breath of strong spirit,<br>
 115 Their breath of power,<br>
 Their breath of all good fortune whereof they are possessed--<br>
 Asking for this,<br>
 Into my warm body<br>
 I shall draw their breath.<br>
 120 In order that our roads may reach<br>
 To where the road of our sun father comes out,<br>
 In order that we may finish our roads,<br>
 For this I add to your breath.<br>
 To this end, my father,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[70. By means of medicine knowledge he will secure new members for the society.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 834}</p>
 <p>125 May you be blessed with light.</p>
 <p>To this the father replies:</p>
 <p>Now indeed<br>
 Our fathers' medicines<br>
 To one another we give.<br>
 130 Our fathers' life-giving breath,<br>
 Their breath of old age,<br>
 (We give to one another.)<br>
 When, among all the corn priests' ladder descending children,<br>
 Some evil causes sickness,<br>
 135 When the spirit fails,<br>
 Then, desiring their fathers' long life,<br>
 Desiring their old age,<br>
 Desiring their medicine,<br>
 140 Among all their fathers,<br>
 Society priests,<br>
 Society p?ekwins,<br>
 Society bow priests,<br>
 They will look about.<br>
 145 Even though you do not know of it,<br>
 If the divine ones choose you,<br>
 When they summon you<br>
 You shall not think to refuse.<br>
 150 With prayer meal,<br>
 With shell,<br>
 With rich clothing,<br>
 They will bind you fast.<br>
 Then seeking these wherever they are,<br>
 155 Even though the night be dangerous,<br>
 Following your fathers,<br>
 Even to all the places where you did not think to enter,<br>
 Seeking these,<br>
 160 Living for their thoughts,<br>
 Thus shall you live.[71]</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">PRAYER FOR STALKING DEER</h2>
 <p>When a hunter sees deer tracks he crouches down in the trail and offers prayer meal to the deer, with the request that he may reveal himself. The following text is taken from a folk We in which success in hunting is the test imposed on suitors. Several suitors fail because they neglect to offer prayer meal to the prey.</p>
 <p>This day<br>
 He who holds our roads,<br>
 Our sun father,<br>
 Has come out standing to his sacred place.<br>
 Now that he has passed us on our roads,<br>
 Here we pass you on your road.<br>

 The flesh of the white corn,<br>
 Prayer meal,<br>
 Shell,<br>
 Corn pollen,<br>
 Here I offer to you.<br>
 With your wisdom<br>
 Taking the prayer meal,<br>
 The shell,<br>
 The corn pollen,<br>
 This day,<br>
 My fathers,<br>
 My mothers,<br>
 In some little hollow,<br>
 In some low brush,<br>
 You will reveal yourselves to me.<br>
 Then with your flesh,<br>
 With your living waters,<br>
 May I sate myself. In order that this may be<br>
 Here I offer your prayer meal.</p></body>
