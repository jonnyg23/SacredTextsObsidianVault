 <h3 align="CENTER">(THE INTERROGATION OF THE CHIEFS)</h3>
 <p>This is the language of Zuyua <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the understanding for our lord, Señor Governor Mariscal, <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">2</font></a> who has settled at Tzuc-uaxim to the east of Ichcanziho (Merida). This is the land where his garden and homestead were, where he settled. Then the day will come when his period of office shall end also. The command of the head-chief comes. Vigorous is his command, when he arrives, and red is his garment also.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_235"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_236">88:2</a> Probably Don Carlos de Luna y Arellano, governor of Yucatan from 1604 to 1612. Cogolludo Bk. 8, Chap. 12. His period of office was, however, in Katun 5 Ahau, and not 3 Ahau as stated here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_236"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_237">89:1</a> This and the other blurred crowned heads in this chapter seem to represent the so-called "ruler" of the katun-prophecies in Chapter XXII. It is of especial interest to find these heads pictured in connection with the present questionnaire, and it suggests that we have here an important ceremony associated with the establishment of a new katun-marker. The crowned head probably represents the glyph Ahau.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_238">89:2</a> When a katun was half finished, the idol of the succeeding katun was set up and also worshipped (Landa 1929, p. 98).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_238"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_239">89:3</a> Probably a reference to the erotic religious practices of which the early Spanish missionaries complained.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_240">89:4</a> Lit.: the demand for knowledge or understanding.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_242">89:6</a> It is not known what sort of a blessing the pagan Maya recited over their ordinary meals. Here the usual Christian benediction is no doubt meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_242"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_243">90:1</a> The gum of the copal (<i>Protium copal</i> Engl.) was the principal incense used by the Maya. The thick clouds of smoke may have suggested the convolutions of the brain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_258">92:3</a> Here, as among the Aztecs, the mat and throne are symbols of authority. Believing Cortez to be the returning Quetzalcoatl, Montezuma greeted him with these words: "My royal ancestors have said that you would come to visit your city and that you would sit upon your mat and chair when you returned" (Seler 1923, p. 447).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_260">93:1</a> This portrayal of the <i>halach-uinic</i> dressed as a Spanish dignitary is probably due to an effort to make it real to the Seventeenth or Eighteenth Century Maya reader, rather than because of ignorance.</p>

This suggests that our questionnaire was originally a method by which the Xius, a 'West Zuyua people," ousted Itzá chieftains from the towns over which they (the Xius) had gained control. We shall see on page <a href="cbc24.htm#page_137">137</a> that the Itzá also had a questionnaire of their own.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_265">94:1</a> We know little of the Maya conception of the moon. It is certain, however, that in their later history they were greatly influenced by the Mexicans among whom the moon was associated with the rabbit, the symbol of drunkenness, and with Tlaçolteotl, the goddess of sinful love.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="cbc14.htm#fr_266">94:2</a> Maya, <i>ah-cuch-cab</i>, which could also mean the honey-bearer. The translator believes the town official is meant because he was so subservient before any higher authority.</p>

In any case it came eventually to mean only mysterious words which were obscure to all but the ruling class. This example of the questionnaire has no doubt sadly degenerated. Nevertheless the mention of a number of things like the horse, known only to the Maya since the Spanish Conquest, indicates that this interrogatory continued to develop during the colonial period, although the Spanish rulers of the country were entirely unaware of its existence. A discussion of the traditions of caste and chieftainship among the Maya will be found in Appendix E.</p>
